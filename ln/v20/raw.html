his safe base.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway&#39;s face contorted in humiliation as he screamed without changing his blood-stained robe. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rudra ! What kind of a hero are you if you couldn&#39;t protect Veldanava-sama!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was Feldway&#39;s true feeling, which made him furious from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knew that Rudra was strong, but he had not expected that he could beat him with his &quot;Castle Guard&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, the defeat of the &quot;Castle Guard&quot;, which he believed was invincible, was too unexpected even for Feldway. Even if he had not been so cautious, it would have been a good enough reason for him to choose to retreat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway understands that this is not a shame, but he is still unable to control the anger that is welling up inside him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a decisive defeat, though it is abhorrent. By telling himself this, Feldway tries to regain his composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Specifically, he forgets about his own defeat and focuses his attention on the war situation of others. As a result, he is shocked by an unexpected turn of events.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Michael-sama, have you taken care of Demon Lord Rimuru?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Rimuru was the biggest concern. So Feldway sends a &#39;thought&#39; to Michael first, but there is no response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;What&#39;s going on? What&#39;s going on?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael and Feldway are one and the same because they share the same authority. No matter how far apart they are, even if they exist in different dimensions, their shared intention should never be broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only case where this is possible is when one of them is in a critical situation where the other is unable to respond... Still, unlike Feldway, Michael is a &#39;Parallel Existence&#39;, so he should be able to revive himself from any situation. Unlike Feldway, Michael is a &#39;Parallel Existence&#39;, so he should be able to come back from any situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So there is no reason to be in such a hurry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There should be no reason to panic, but the lack of response was an anomaly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(If the stopped time was released, the game should have been won by now...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Demon Lord Rimuru does not even know the existence of &quot;Suspended World&quot;. In other words, the plan was accomplished when they lured Leon to the bait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway&#39;s heart was filled with a bad premonition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the message was delivered.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&quot;Ah... my wish has</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;come true. </span><span class="c3">Feldway, I only regret that I have to leave you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;behind.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the &#39;thought&#39; that Michael sent to Feldway with his last strength as he was about to disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel Michael&#39;s power inside me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Michael&#39;s will did not exist there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What it meant was Michael&#39;s &quot;death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nonsense...Michael-sama is &#39;Parallel Existence&#39;, isn&#39;t it? Whatever the situation, if I am safe, it should be possible to revive me...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was so distraught that he had no time to even try to mend his situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael was the first friend he had made.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Zalario and Fenn, Michael was the first friend he had ever allowed himself to be open about his true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cautious Feldway had prioritized Michael&#39;s safety by taking ten, twenty, or even more precautions until he felt that it was absolutely safe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, there is no sign of Michael&#39;s revival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, the Ultimate Skill &#39;Justice King (Michael)&#39; had not disappeared, and there was a sign that Manas had returned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no ego, though there is a response when asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was merely the power to control the &#39;Justice King (Michael)&#39; in its complete form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a fundamentally different existence from Michael, Feldway&#39;s friend who wished to revive Veldanava of his own free will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway had no choice but to admit that his friend Michael had completely disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why...why did this happen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he wondered, but no one could answer his question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway is stunned by this unbelievable event.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he thinks of Michael&#39;s last words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What does he mean when he says that his wish has come true?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway does not understand it at all, but he feels a little better now that he knows that Michael did not disappear in pain and that his life had meaning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, however, he cannot help feeling jealous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not fair of him to be satisfied with himself and leave me behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was lonely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the head of the Seven Primordial Angels, he was the leader of the group, and all the responsibilities fell on his shoulders. All decisions were left to Feldway&#39;s will, without the possibility of consulting anyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Veldanava left, there was no way to escape the pressure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To everyone&#39;s dismay, Feldway remained in the forefront as a leader.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was inevitable that Feldway, who made all decisions on his own, would be out of step with his colleagues. It was Feldway&#39;s fault that he did not care what his colleagues thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The accumulation of such a situation led to discord, and without Feldway&#39;s knowing it, the wheels of the group gradually fell out of place. As a result, we have become a group that lacks cohesion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is fortunate or unfortunate for Feldway that he is unaware of this reality... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn, his friend, is also a friend, but he does not trust him enough to show his weakness. After all, there was no one, not even one person in the whole wide world, who could understand Feldway and heal his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Michael appeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a comrade with the same goal in mind, as a friend who could understand each other, Michael fulfilled Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a joy he had never experienced before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael had become as important to Feldway as Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the reality was cruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The friend he had finally made disappeared, leaving Feldway behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first time in his life, Feldway was in a weak mood, wondering what to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, generals, quit being so glum and tell me what to do next.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was true that Feldway was stunned, though it was only for a blink of an eye. However, it was Vega, who is well known for his lack of discretion, who did not pay any attention to Feldway&#39;s stunned state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was another person, Mai Furuki, but she remained silent as usual and kept a quiet eye on the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vega was the only one who seemed indifferent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was offended and looked at Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shut up. We just lost contact with Michael-sama. You should know that I don&#39;t have time for you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He spat out and tried to silence Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Vega did not read the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? Michael&#39;s guy lost after he was so arrogant. What a pity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was enough reason for Feldway to become furious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said shut up!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway shouted, and then he hit Vega with an aggressive and fierce attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gosh, this guy is amazing...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was like heaven and earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a gap in strength between Feldway and Vega that could not be filled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Vega did not shut up even after realizing this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, generals, are you saying I&#39;m wrong? Michael lost because he was weak. It&#39;s the world of the weak and the strong, and there&#39;s no justice once you&#39;re dead! Am I right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His words may sound like an incitement, but this is Vega&#39;s true intention and principle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a sense, it is a good argument and a truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if it were so, Feldway could not nod his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t you talk about Michael-sama!&quot; he said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he tried to silence Vega by hitting him to cancel his words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vega still does not shut up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What the hell are you talking about? Look, you didn&#39;t give a shit when that bastard Cornu died, and you didn&#39;t give a shit when I ate Oria and Arios, right? That&#39;s because you thought I was right, right? Am I right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was not sad to hear of Cornu&#39;s death. He was more displeased with the failure of the mission and was busy thinking of the next best thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he had such an attitude toward his old colleagues, Oria and Arios, who he considered as nothing more than pawns, were nothing more than insignificant. When I learned that Vega had eaten them, I felt only mechanically that it was not a waste if it had led to Vega&#39;s enhancement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I did not blame Vega, in fact, I even thought that it had strengthened their strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn, he talked down to me...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Heh, that&#39;s my nature.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was slightly upset when he realized how he was feeling. Not letting him know this, he increased his pressure on Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you know? We have a higher purpose, and we will sacrifice whatever it takes to achieve it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vega shouted against Feldway, interrupting his words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shut up, you spoiled brat!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It should have been impossible to resist the fierce pressure that compressed the space. Yet, Vega was furious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You know, it&#39;s common knowledge that the world is a cruel place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vega has lived in a harsh environment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, his words carry weight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway also becomes silent and allows Vega to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yuuki, who was my boss, was trying to resist the absurdity of the situation. Well, looking back on it now, I wonder how he could have done so much with such a small power. But I still believed in him. I was ready to scratch his head if he showed any weakness, but Yuuki had a tricky character. Sure enough, you pretended to be manipulated, didn&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So what? The Yuuki is not in this world now, is he? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, that&#39;s right. Yes, he is. Yuuki couldn&#39;t do it. He said that no matter how idealistic or righteous we may be, we are nothing in the face of such an insurmountable gap of power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is true that I wanted to make fun of Yuuki when I heard he was being manipulated. However, Vega was still concerned about Yuuki in some part of his mind. He thought it was a habit he had learned in his life, but it seems that he instinctively realized that Yuuki was not being manipulated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was glad that I did not get carried away with Yuuki, and lamented the impermanence of the world when I heard that he was killed by Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Vega tells Feldway</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The world where we can live happily is just a maboroshi. Then, you&#39;ve just got to be honest. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Honest?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. As long as the eternal truth is that the law of the jungle is the law of the jungle, the only right thing to do is to stand at the top of it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Power is justice, Vega reaffirmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how beautiful it is, it is meaningless if it is not realized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Conversely, if it can be realized, anything is allowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In short, all that matters is that we don&#39;t lose. No matter how vicious the act is, it will be justified as long as you are not defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how cowardly you are, you win if you survive to the end. This is Vega&#39;s way of life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To such a Vega, a defeated Michael is worthless. It was hard to understand that Feldway, who was much stronger than Vega, was lamenting for the losers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are strong, generals. Even Jahil, who beat Yuki, is not as strong as you. That Velzard woman is a monster, but I think you&#39;re better than her. Of course, you&#39;re better than that Michael guy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, from now on you&#39;re our boss. No one will have a problem with that.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway is strong, so this is a natural consequence. Vega declared without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are a simple man. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t praise me like that, I&#39;m embarrassed.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway sighed, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it as a compliment. At the same time, however, he is aware that his grief over the loss of Michael is fading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps this is Vega&#39;s way of consoling him. Feldway thought suddenly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Power, huh? Surely, we have little to lose in that regard.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he has lost Michael, the power has returned to Feldway. It is because Michael gave his last strength to Feldway, though he lost some.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the proof that our friend cared for Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, I could not let it go to waste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may be wrong to intentionally take away the power of one&#39;s friends like Vega did, but the result is the same. He had no intention of blaming Vega, but now Feldway felt a kinship with Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Very well. From now on I will be king in place of Michael-sama. I swear to you that I will defend the throne until Veldanava-sama is restored. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once he had made up his mind, the only thing left to do was to act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway had always been under Michael&#39;s thumb. He had kept his true body hidden so as not to attract attention, but now he had no reason to keep it out of sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now was the time to take up residence in the body that had been hidden in the other world and unleash it all, in order to fully harness the power that Michael had left me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s been a long time since I revealed my true self. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway, the first simulacrum created by Veldanava, looked very much like its creator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Veldanava had long jet-black hair that held the radiance of the stars, like the world itself, Feldway had long, silvery white hair that represented shining light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His slit eyes are cool and shining like blue stars. It would be more correct to call them divine than beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in his eyes, there was a steel will filled with determination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a lie that she had looked like a somewhat fake doll before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their gender looks both male and female as before, but that is because they are too beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As befits its &quot;beauty,&quot; it has a tremendous presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the powers that Michael had gathered were also Feldway&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under the control of Manas &quot;Michael&quot;, there are &#39;Knowledge King (Raphael)&#39;, &#39;Covenant King (Uriel) There are four angelic Ultimate Skills except for &#39;Knowledge King (Raphael)&#39;, &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39;, and &#39;Hope King (Sariel)&#39;, and the powers associated with them are still alive and well in the form of information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, the factors of Velzard and Velgrynd, the two &#39;True Dragons&#39;, have become flesh and blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In terms of strength, Feldway is now more substantial than ever before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Amazing...really, he&#39;s a monster...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vega swallowed his spit and muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was his true feeling that leaked out unintentionally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was radiating such a strong energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was no longer the same person as before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Vega, thanks to you I am awake. I should thank you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Heh, that&#39;s all right.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vega smiles a little embarrassed. But he quickly mends it and adds with his usual sullen expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But don&#39;t forget. I&#39;m always after you. You&#39;re no match for me now, so I&#39;ll follow you, but if you show any weakness, I&#39;ll eat you!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Undoubtedly, this is a cover for his embarrassment, but it is also Vega&#39;s true intention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Knowing this, Feldway nodded his head happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hm, I&#39;m counting on you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Feldway smiled with a creepy atmosphere that was different from the past.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.4d34og8"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-003.png" src="images/image24.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.2s8eyo1"></a><a id="id.17dp8vu"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-004.png" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.3rdcrjn"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the old Eurazania, at the site of Demon Lord Milim&#39;s new capital.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were those who fought to the death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is Esprit, fighting against Peliod the Light-Haired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(To tell the truth, it is not my character to fight so seriously...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(To tell the truth, it is not my character to fight so seriously...) The battle was so hopeless that I wanted to complain about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod, which nullifies magic, was the worst match for Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the nuclear magic: Nuclear Cannon, which he shot at close range with the best of intentions, was reflected back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod can reflect all kinds of magic with his prismatic barrier. Moreover, it applies not only to magic but also to a certain amount of emission-type techniques.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod was a natural enemy of demons who used magic as a weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit was bitter at his own helplessness. Then, an unexpected helper appeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll help you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio, who had given up the command of the unit to Suphia, joined Esprit saying, &quot;I&#39;ll help you. Although they should have supported Suphia, each member of the &quot;flying squad&quot; is a genuine warrior. They move appropriately without being ordered to do so, and their units are well organized. The morale of the whole army is improved when the commander and his deputy take the lead in a battle rather than waiting in the rear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio is leading this time because Suphia is usually the one who runs away from the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can see he&#39;s in trouble, can&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I do. But, I&#39;m still better than you, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit, who excels at magic, seems to be outmatched by Phobio, who excels at hand-to-hand combat. Even against an opponent who cannot use magic, there is a high possibility that Phobio can still find a way out of this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, that may be so. Well, I&#39;ll fight with it, then. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit had intended to do so from the beginning, but he decided to use the magic sword as a chance to win the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Esprit with his sword at the ready and Phobio in his half-animal form, face the beautiful and bewitching Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two against one. Even so, they were overwhelmingly outnumbered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit steps in and draws his sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is hard to believe that he was an amateur until the other day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is true that he started learning as a hobby, but Esprit is an obsessive person. In his free time, he practiced over and over again, repeating the kata that Agera had shown him. The result was the brilliance of his technique in such a short period of time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sadly, however, Peliod was even better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn, it&#39;s a fake. It&#39;s so elaborate that it&#39;s hard to distinguish it from the real thing...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, just when we think we have indeed made a cut, Peliod disappears, scattering particles of light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, Esprit thought it was an afterimage, but he soon realized that it was not. For the next moment, Peliod split into multiple bodies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Esprit&#39;s &#39;Ultra Intuition&#39; couldn&#39;t see them, and none of them was distinguishable from the real one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is impossible, Esprit thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wished he could help Carrera in some small way, but it would only buy him a little more time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio came in as a helper, but it was nothing more than a drop in the bucket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Honestly speaking, it was better than nothing?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a story that can be solved by two people fighting together. Peliod&#39;s strength was outstanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected, Esprit and Phobio were attacked from all sides. They could only defend themselves from the onslaught of attacks, unable to tell which was the main body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit is a cash cow, so he doesn&#39;t waste any time. He gives up this fight as if he is resetting the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just don&#39;t die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I guess he can come back to life even if he dies, but that means he can&#39;t follow Rimuru-sama&#39;s orders. Carrera-sama would be furious, and I can&#39;t forgive myself either).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, Esprit can&#39;t die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he was not allowed to leave the front, and it was a dead end, to put it simply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of this dichotomous thinking, Esprit&#39;s movement was slowed down. It was not Peliod who missed the opportunity, but his fangs were on the move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t just stand there!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit was kicked away by Phobio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately after that, the place where Esprit had been standing before was covered with poisonous scales released by Peliod. It is a poison that kills even demons, though it has a fantastically beautiful glow. Its toxicity, which corrodes the body and destroys the spirit, is so fierce that even Esprit, the count&#39;s demon peer, can&#39;t withstand it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re hurting me...&quot; &quot;Thank you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ow!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit thanked Phobio lightly, and Phobio resumed his attack on Peliod. He repeatedly fired seemingly futile claw attacks, scattering his countless alter egos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is completely pointless as long as one cannot tell the real ones from the fake ones. However, Phobio did not give up in a foolish way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are weaker than me, why don&#39;t you give up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit asked him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not expect an answer, since there was no point in asking that question. Phobio, however, smiled wryly and said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re a rude guy. Well, whatever. You live and you win. As Geld-san said, it doesn&#39;t matter as long as we survive and win the next one.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So now, we have to get a clue for the next one. That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do, Phobio says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I&#39;m weak. It&#39;s frustrating, but I just have to do what I can do.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio&#39;s surprisingly serious answer satisfied Esprit, and he agreed. And he agrees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m a competitive person myself, but you&#39;re a good one, too. I&#39;ll give you that, Phobio. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks, Esprit-dono. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can be more relaxed with me, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve made mistakes before. I&#39;ve made mistakes before... and I don&#39;t think you have time to talk too much.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Esprit, Phobio is serious. Even if he can&#39;t win, he is not running away from the fight, but is pushing hard against Peliod. As a jet-black wind, his claws had slashed through many alter egos, but they had been ineffective.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now, perhaps feeling annoyed, Peliod strikes back for the first time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The scales swirled and drilled their way toward Phobio. Even the smallest of scales can be a deadly weapon when they come together. If Phobio were to be hit directly, his body would surely become a slice of meat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio understands this better than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The difference in the strength of the two players is obvious, and it would be suicide for them to face Peliod. However, he had made the same decision as Esprit that Carrera would be defeated if he did not try his best at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Then, I had no choice but to do it, even if it was reckless. My life is worth a small price if I can divert attention from the situation.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio is proud to be a Beastketeer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wants to escape, but that would be an act of losing Karion&#39;s trust and a betrayal to his men who believe in Phobio. It was this conviction that he could never allow such a betrayal that drove Phobio to do what he did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio&#39;s fighting style is to use his high mobility to taunt his enemies and kill them with sharp claws. Although his defense was not so high, it was not so much of a problem because of his evasive maneuverability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, he barely survived due to his speed. Even though he is walking on a very dangerous tightrope, where even a slight break in concentration can result in his death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit was reviewing such a Phobio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Hmmm, Gobua-san, Benimaru-sama&#39;s subordinate? I thought he was a strange guy who always talked about his love affairs with his girlfriends, but he is a real player when he has to be. Unlike demons who can come back to life even after death, Gobua-san is a fragile human being who will be dead only after death...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Esprit&#39;s point of view, even Phobio, who has become one of the most powerful of the greater majin, is no more than a fragile human being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit is a great demon, the elite of the elite, who follows Carrera, one of the pillars of the king of demons. Since death is not the end, but a resurrection like a continuation in a game, Esprit lacks a sense of crisis. Depending on the damage, he may be put into a sleep of several hundred years, but to the demons who live in eternity, it is only a blink of an eye.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Esprit was dazzled by those who were trying their best to live within their limited time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What about himself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whenever he had a problem, Carrera, his master, took care of it, and Agera, his colleague, took care of the trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Until now, Esprit had no experience of doing something desperate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Am I more useless than Phobio-san?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is a definite no, someone deep in Esprit&#39;s heart cried out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps that someone was Esprit&#39;s true feelings of hating to lose, which he had almost forgotten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a proof, Esprit, who had almost given up, stood up again strongly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not because of such backward reasons, such as the fact that it would be a violation of the order if he died.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wanted to win, and he had a clear will in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;To tell you the truth, it&#39;s impossible to beat him, isn&#39;t it? So, Phobio-san, let&#39;s harass him as hard as we can!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit is a very cash realist, so he doesn&#39;t have reckless dreams that he might win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was really calmly constructing the tactical victory conditions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hm, do you have a good plan? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio asked with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sensed the change in Esprit&#39;s mood and realized that his chances of winning had shifted from zero to positive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We can&#39;t win if we play it the right way. So, I know it&#39;s a little tricky, but can you make a devil&#39;s bargain with me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even now, the scales are snatching at Phobio, and the fine scars on his body continue to grow. It was only a matter of time before the poison would reach Phobio&#39;s body, which meant that Phobio&#39;s life was about to end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite the situation, Phobio laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Another contract...&quot; he said, &quot;but I don&#39;t have time to worry about it. Okay. So, what&#39;s this devil&#39;s bargain all about?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio has a bitter memory of being cheated out of a contract with Footman and his friends before. But Phobio is already prepared for it, as he still agrees to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit replies casually.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s a common one. Tell me your wish. In return, I will ask for your soul.&#39; It&#39;s a common method used by demons to corrupt humans.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since demons feed on human souls, big and small, they are good at such contracts. They are well versed in all kinds of magic to meet any kind of wish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is not true of newborn demons, but only of those who have lived through the ages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, for Esprit, it was a simple little trick that he could do at his leisure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir. I believe in Esprit-dono, so I&#39;ll take you up on that deal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio agreed without even a groan of pain, even though his right arm was ground into a fine powder dust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Esprit smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good, if I had worried even a little, I would have missed it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, Esprit had already made preparations even before he heard Phobio&#39;s answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, of course, I wish...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The power to get through this!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit nodded his head and activated the devil&#39;s contract to make Phobio&#39;s wish come true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, in return, the passage to Phobio&#39;s soul opens, allowing Esprit to enter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit hesitates for a moment, and then she leaves her body to break her hesitation. Then, in his natural form as a spiritual life form, he entered into the soul of Phobio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is also the Intrinsic Skill &#39;possession&#39; possessed by the demon race. It is sometimes used to take over the body of a person with whom one has made a contract, and this time the purpose of its use was similar to that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I really didn&#39;t want to use this method. I really didn&#39;t want to use this method. I had to leave the wonderful body I received from Rimuru-sama on the battlefield like this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What the hell is going on here? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39; &#39;Calm down. We&#39;re in the middle of a critical situation, but I&#39;ve stretched time a million times over with my &#39;super-speed thinking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing Esprit&#39;s calm voice, Phobio had time to comprehend the situation. It is true that the world seems to have stopped as if time had stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;...I see, this is the world the people at the top are seeing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;As for me, I&#39;m not there yet. Carrera-sama is said to be 100 million times better than me, so even ritual magic that takes years to perform can be activated in an instant. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;haha, that&#39;s amazing...&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not that it&#39;s amazing, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s on a different level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a world beyond Phobio&#39;s comprehension.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ignoring Phobio&#39;s astonishment and dismay, Esprit began to explain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have time, or at least enough time, so listen to me. I have taken off my body and returned to my original spiritual existence and took up residence in you. I would normally take over the host and use its power for my own, but there is a procedure to do that, and to be honest, it won&#39;t make me much stronger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio specializes in physical combat, especially melee fighting. He was trained by Midley as well, and his skills (level) had been greatly improved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Esprit had just started to learn swordsmanship as a hobby. Peliod was specialized in magic, so he was able to use it to some extent, but he was soon to be defeated. Therefore, he decided to let Phobio take the lead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this does not mean that I will do nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;I have taken up residence in you in order to concentrate our forces. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;You can continue to focus on evasion as you always have. As it is, you&#39;d have been killed within a good five minutes, but if you&#39;d combined my powers...&#39;&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit took advantage of the devil&#39;s pact to inhabit Phobio. He then decided to give all his power to Phobio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I use my power, you think I can defeat him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio&#39;s intuition whispered to him that it couldn&#39;t be that simple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not the kind of opponent that can be defeated just by that. They seem to have more &#39;vision&#39; than I do. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod also has &#39;compound eyes&#39; that can read all information. He is able to reflect any kind of magic because he is clearly aware of the flow of magicule.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was obvious when he threw back Carrera&#39;s &quot;Abyss Annihilation&quot; in his first move. This fact proves that Peliod is more skilled in handling magic than Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, Thought Acceleration must be better than Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, what are you going to do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;We will try to survive as long as we can. Of course, not only you, but I will help you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Phobio takes the initiative in melee combat, Esprit himself intends to fight with magic. The purpose was to mitigate the attack on Phobio, on the assumption that it would not work either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see. So you will increase the chance of survival as much as possible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exactly. The tactical victory here is to survive until someone who can defeat her comes. And if we can get her attention and keep her out of Carrera-sama&#39;s way, then we have nothing to complain about. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, we have to buy time, don&#39;t we?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;That&#39;s the only way. There is a clear difference in their abilities, so it can&#39;t be helped. But don&#39;t worry. According to my calculations, you should be able to hold out for 20 minutes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s very encouraging... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio laughs, saying that this is not reassuring at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I&#39;m blown away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It pains me to admit it, but Phobio is weak. He decided to do his best to fight the weak in their own way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, the battle enters the second round.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, Phobio and Esprit are now one, and their existence values are also added to each other, so they have increased. However, it is less than a million, which is not much more than that of Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, thanks to the much better performance than before, we were able to compete with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the reasons for this is that Phobio does not care about his physical injuries anymore, since Esprit has started to shoulder the damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he doesn&#39;t care about physical exhaustion either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio has decided to stop worrying about the various problems and has changed to a full-throttle combat style, giving up the long-term battle once and for all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, such an action would shorten the time limit of the active battle. Nevertheless, the reason why such a strategy was successful was that Esprit was complementing mana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio&#39;s &#39;bestiality&#39; has three stages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first is the normal majin form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the most balanced form and the least burdensome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second is the leopard-headed majin form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second is the leopard-headed majin form, which is specialized for fighting and is versatile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The third is the fully animalized form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the fastest in terms of speed alone. However, it is not suitable for combat against humans, as it cannot handle most of the skills it has been trained for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio is now the most powerful leopard-headed majin form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is not fuel-efficient, and his body is damaged when he exerts his full strength. Phobio had been fighting with a cautious approach, always controlling his power and releasing it at a moment&#39;s notice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even when damaged, the beastmen could manage because of their high regenerative ability. However, it was not good for long-term battles because it consumed stamina and mana to maintain such a high level of regeneration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, Phobio is able to put all these concerns aside and concentrate on fighting. His lost hand was regenerated and he was able to use his full strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All thanks to Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit is protecting Phobio by taking his soul into his mental body. This is made possible by Esprit&#39;s Unique Skill &#39;Discerner&#39;. With this skill, Esprit can have a connection beyond time and space with those whom he knows, and he can control the soul more perfectly by using it together with the Satanic Contract.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, Esprit will suffer a lot of damage, but that is about it. He showed his devilish nature and endured it with all kinds of resistance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, what hurts hurts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Really, I don&#39;t like bugs. Direct attacks on the mind and Pain Nullification are meaningless. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The advantage of insectar over demons is the accumulation of each of these factors. Because of the worst compatibility, insectar always wins if the players are of equal strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these unfavorable conditions, Esprit&#39;s damage is quickly accumulating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, Phobio is still alive and well. At Esprit&#39;s expense, the game remains competitive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there was one piece of good news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knew it. They are more persistent than I thought they would be, but now I know why. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Hmm?&#39; &#39;No, don&#39;t listen to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, you don&#39;t have to listen to me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit explains.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;It seems that she is specialized in magic and damaged by Carrera-sama&#39;s magic, after all. I thought there was no way she could repel such a huge magic with no risk. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s &quot;Abyss Annihilation&quot; has the power to destroy even a planet depending on how it is used. Esprit thought that there must be some kind of an anomaly since he had received it head-on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not strong enough to prove it, but he was finally convinced by possessing Phobio and making full use of &#39;Discerner&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;So, if I target the weak part, can I win?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;That&#39;s impossible. It&#39;s only because they are weakened that they are less aggressive, but their defenses are ironclad. But, on the other hand, it would be good for us too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing Esprit&#39;s answer, Phobio is silent for a moment. Then he lets out a heavy sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;I guess we&#39;ll just have to keep running until reinforcements arrive...&#39;&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a regrettable and unwilling conclusion, but it is the only one that can be reached.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio gives up and concentrates on Peliod&#39;s movement to fulfill his role.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forty minutes passed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;...We worked hard, didn&#39;t we?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m too tired to talk. I can&#39;t do it anymore. I&#39;m really going to die. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though wounded to the bone, Phobio was still alive. Esprit, who is protecting his soul and taking the damage, is barely conscious. Esprit is very satisfied with the result, since he had thought that twenty minutes would be enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it was a result of giving it his all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod, on the other hand, is in good shape. His movement was even better than at the beginning of the battle, which meant that he was recovering from the damage inflicted by Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Strategically, it is a great victory, but tactically, it is a defeat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&#39;s OK. Both Phobio and Esprit have done their part.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Damn, I&#39;m so disappointed that I got a girlfriend too...&#39; &#39;What&#39;s wrong? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is it? Is that why you worked harder than you expected? Well, I praise you for exceeding my expectations, and as a reward I&#39;ll take your message to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since you can&#39;t get up anymore, all you can do is to wait for death. So, they make light talk with each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio wants to enjoy the memories of Gobua whom he has come to know, but Esprit prevents him from doing so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you the devil?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, I&#39;m a demon. I&#39;m a demon, what&#39;s wrong?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was. It&#39;s sad that you don&#39;t get my sarcasm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m troubled by your praise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t compliment you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not complimenting you? Well, I guess you&#39;re right. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through this intense battle, the two had become casual conversationalists.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, while drowning their fears of death and the humiliation of defeat, they wait for that moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But...</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without moving his face, Peliod holds out his hand. The magic activation organ, which had been destroyed by Carrera&#39;s magic, has been restored, and mana can be operated more efficiently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio, who is lying on his side and unable to move, can be dealt with in a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod waits joyfully for Phobio&#39;s scream of death, not thinking that Phobio and his friends are talking lightly to each other to prolong the moment. Peliod does not feel any respect for the person who has made him so difficult, but only pursues the pleasure that his instincts demand.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-The dense compressed mana rays from Peliod&#39;s fingertips do not pierce Phobio, but cut into the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A hobgoblin leaps out from Phobio&#39;s shadow, grabs Phobio&#39;s leg, and throws him down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then-!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! Isn&#39;t my appearance perfectly timed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a voice echoed through the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The owner of the voice was the well-known Gobta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had rushed to the scene as a reinforcement to break out of this critical situation, and he had arrived on the scene with a full heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta was not the only one to arrive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobua, a red-haired beauty in a scarlet military uniform, caught Phobio as he flew toward her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She caught Phobio firmly with her breast, and she was moving backward to protect him from Peliod&#39;s attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phobio thought to himself, &quot;I&#39;ve done it,&quot; but that is a secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga, who appeared at the end, stood in the front to protect Gobta, and threatened Peliod who was trying to pursue him. Without any hesitation, he succeeded in delaying Peliod&#39;s movement by performing the &quot;Apocalypse Howling&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Phobio and Esprit, who had been inhabiting Phobio, had a narrow escape from death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back in the body he had left behind, Esprit gets up with a start and says, &quot;Oh, my God!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, Gobta-sama is the best! I knew you would come to save me!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit, whose eyes are shining brightly, is actually a fan of Gobta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, really? I&#39;m so embarrassed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;As the Four Heavenly Kings, please show us your good looks!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit is trying to flatter Gobta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not trying to stir things up, but he was serious from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well then, when this battle is over, we&#39;ll go on a date...&quot;, Gobta said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta was on a roll at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m ready for that kind of thing!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a point that should not be misunderstood, since it was not a feeling of liking or anything like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Esprit also left the front line, leaving Gobta with a drooping head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the collapse of the front was averted by the efforts of Phobio and Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a change of players, the battle was brought to the third round.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few moments after the opening of the battle, several inviolable areas were formed on the battlefield. In these zones, battles between transcendentalists are taking place, and those who are not strong enough are reduced to dust just by approaching them.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Above the battlefield, the one-on-one battle between Milim Four Heavenly Kings Frey and Insect General Torun was becoming so fierce that nothing could stand in their way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &quot;Heavenly Kings&quot; and &quot;Milim&#39;s Guards&quot; had no choice but to watch from afar, so as not to get caught up in the aerial battle between the two heroes, which left even the speed of sound behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same is true for the flying bugs under Torun, who are spreading out in a wide disarray in their ranks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the battlefield in the sky seemed to be left to the two heroes to decide the winner, but this was clearly a mistake. Looking at the battlefield from a bird&#39;s eye view, only the forces of one side continued to decrease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shishi shishi! You&#39;re weak. You&#39;re good at this, you just run away!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first, Frey went on the offensive. But after he was evaded by his signature claw attack, he was on the defensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, he had attacked several times, but they were of no use to Torun, and he did not seem to be a threat. If he was serious about this, it was safe to say that he was an enemy with nothing to see but his speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, Torun was not the kind of guy who would let his guard down, which was the reason why the battle had lasted this long...but I was beginning to think that it was time to end it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was why I said what I did, but Frey snickered at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, you see it that way? Then you should thank me.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Torun tilted his head, not understanding what he meant. He was the one who should have been the one who had been cornered, but Frey&#39;s expression showed a definite smile of composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank God you&#39;re an idiot.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What do you think is the most important element in battle?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, you&#39;re right. But...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey agrees that speed is the most important factor. At the same time, however, there was another factor that should not be forgotten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not based on physical ability, but on intelligence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, it was the way of fighting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When two fighters of the same level of ability clash with each other, the outcome of the fight depends greatly on how they think about fighting or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In this case, the current situation proved it.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.26in1rg"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey knew that the fight would be prolonged as soon as the first shot was evaded. Therefore, he thought that it was important to take only the enemy&#39;s physical strength without fatiguing him, and he played the role of a fighter seeking optimal efficiency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This tactic was not limited to himself but also included his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Frey controlled the situation of the war to his own advantage by involving the enemy forces in the aftermath of the battle between himself and Torun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey&#39;s special feature was his intelligence in using Torun&#39;s power to drive the enemy army to the brink of destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is Frey. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the true nature of the cunning Sky Queen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey laughs at him, and Torun finally realizes what&#39;s going on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? You&#39;ve been after this thing since the first time...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re cocky... but I can&#39;t get a scratch on me, so I&#39;m the one who&#39;s going to win!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Torun, enraged, accelerated and closed in on Frey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Frey was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Torun&#39;s aerial attacks are so troublesome that the Demon Lord Seed class cannot even see them, but Frey is a different story. If you watch the game many times, you can see the pattern of Torun&#39;s attacks, and even the predicted point of attack can be calculated based on Torun&#39;s initial speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is dangerous to make assumptions, because some of the strongest players ignore the laws of physics completely, but in the case of Torun, I have confirmed that he is bound by the laws of the Cardinal World.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why I am going to tell you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Assumption is dangerous. I&#39;m a coward, so it takes me a long time to be sure. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Frey finishes, Torun arrives at the expected position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What Torun notices is the pain of the nails piercing his chest exoskeleton.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Torun&#39;s exoskeleton, which has a metallic sheen, is not as strong as his alienium fist. If that were the case, adamantite would be strong enough to pierce it... and the result was the current reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Torun is upset, but it is already too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He tries desperately to resist, but none of Torun&#39;s powers are activated. As soon as Frey&#39;s claws grabbed him, the game was already won.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Torun&#39;s chest, which was pierced through, there was a &quot;magic core&quot; that was important for the insect majin (insector). Frey&#39;s claws are clutching it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, goodbye.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Torun&#39;s magical core is broken successfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was Torun&#39;s death.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lucia and Claire congratulate Frey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good job, Frey-sama. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well done, Frey-sama. We&#39;ll now get down to the serious business of mopping up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey nodded gracefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, please. I&#39;m tired, but the battle is still going on. I don&#39;t think I have time to rest either. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey looks around the battlefield. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks around the battlefield and sees his comrades who are struggling.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey had the upper hand from start to finish, but there were others who did not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the disparity was not as great as that of Phobio&#39;s group, Gabil, who had come as a reinforcement, was showing desperate resistance while being tossed around by the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil is not weak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has gained new strength and has grown to be one of the strongest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, his opponent was too strong. Insect General Beathop was too much for Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil&#39;s existence value is 1.26 million, while Beathop&#39;s is over 1.7 million. The difference in existence value is not a decisive difference in strength, but Beathop&#39;s combat ability such as physical ability is directly related to its existence value in a high percentage. It is an insect-type majin (insector) specialized in close combat because it does not possess any special powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the worst match with the all-powerful Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Gabil had been alone, he would have been defeated long ago. The only reason why he did not lose the battle was because he had a friend to fight with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil-san, are you okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. I am still alive and well! Rest assured, Suphia-dono! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil and Suphia, who had fought together against Midley who had invaded Eurazania, were again teaming up against Beathop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia was also the leader of the &quot;Flying Horsemen,&quot; but he left that role to his subordinates. This time it took some time to take over because Phobio gave up the command first, but Suphia was not suited for command, and he always finished raising everyone&#39;s morale before being relieved of his duties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead, it is better to slaughter as many enemy generals as possible in order to make the most of your individual strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was aware of this, and he did not hesitate to throw himself into the battle this time, too. However, Zelanus&#39; forces were not so easy to deal with, and he was having a hard time, even though he had an advantage of two to one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good, good! This is how a battle should be fought!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The excited Beathop laughed loudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop is drunk with his power. He enjoys defeating the weak with his overwhelming power, and for him, fighting is like a game in which victory is guaranteed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this respect, Gabil and Suphia, his opponents this time, were just the right combination of two opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One by one, it would not have been enough, and the situation of overturning the numerical disadvantage would have excited Beathop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, they were enjoying the battle, even though they could have settled it earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such impure intentions are easily conveyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil and Suphia were desperately trying to find a way to win and lamenting their lack of ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We have faced many strong opponents, but you seem to be the strongest of them all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I see. I&#39;m glad to hear that, but I&#39;m not going to take it easy on you!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop&#39;s voice sounded really happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast, Gabil and Suphia exclaim in displeasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph! That&#39;s a laugh! How can you say that when you haven&#39;t been serious until now? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, you&#39;re right. If you&#39;re a warrior, don&#39;t torture your enemy like a warrior!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop had no intention of cutting corners, but he certainly wanted to prolong the fun. Gabil and Suphia saw it and were offended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, they are still safe thanks to this, which is more irritating than anything else. It is humiliating to be saved by the pride of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In exasperation, Gabil takes a recovery potion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia, likewise, chugs the expensive full potion without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, the countless wounds on their bodies show no sign of recovery. The reason is simple: their existence values have exceeded the prescribed amount of the recovery potion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia has also evolved under the influence of Karion&#39;s awakening, and her existence value has now been enhanced to just under 500,000. Although not as strong as Gabil, Suphia is different from greater majin or Holy Knight class human beings, and the potency of the potion is not enough to completely heal a normal person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The principle of full potion is to activate cells by means of magicule, and even to restore the missing parts by compensating the missing parts. However, for majins with high intracellular magicule density like the Gabils, one or two restorative medicines are not enough to replenish their cells. That is why they used more than a hundred recovery medicines during the battle. If they are slightly injured, even a sprinkling is effective, so they are already drenched in the potion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s a good thing we improved the taste as well. I think we should refrain from taking the recovery medicine for the time being. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I agree. At first I thought the strawberry flavor was good, but now I&#39;m starving.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia is more dependent on recovery pills than Gabil, and she seems quite fed up with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, she is lucky to be alive and well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is all thanks to the training with Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the past several months, they had been learning the art of close combat against Midley. If it had not been for Battlewill&#39;s defensive screen, which they have become proficient at, they would have died without even the use of recovery medicine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that good fortune was about to come to an end when the atmosphere at Beathop changed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, hey, is Torun dead?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop ignored Gabil and the others who were exchanging pleasantries because he noticed that one of his comrades had been shot down by Frey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On a stalemated battlefield, it is dangerous for one side to break off. Knowing this, Beathop decided that it was no longer the time to play around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It can&#39;t be helped. I wanted to take it easy, but I&#39;m going to play a trick on you,&quot; Beathop declared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop declared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not that they had been playing around, it was just that Gabil and his team were doing better than expected. However, it was an equilibrium that had been established because Beathop had thought about the pace of the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like Karion&#39;s strategy, Beathop, who did not want to go all out at this point, played the game in such a way that he could leave some energy left over. But now, with the defeat of his comrades, he has shifted into a mode of destruction without thinking about the consequences.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kill!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop vanished with a single muttered word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Using his leg strength, he closed the distance with the instantaneous force of an &quot;Instantmove&quot;. He then kicked Suphia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia, of course, did not follow Beathop with her eyes, but rather with &#39;Magic Perception&#39;. He had been improving his skills (level), breaking away from the style of fighting only with his own abilities as before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, however.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop&#39;s moves were too fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was no wonder, because he was attacking with all his might, without regard to the damage to his own body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;GHUHH!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia barely protected herself with both arms, but the result was cruel. Her crossed arms were shattered, and she was hit by a powerful kick to the abdomen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Suphia-dono- ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil shouted as Beathop stopped moving in the kicking position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil quickly turns his eyes to Suphia while preparing himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia is barely alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Hmmm... Suphia-dono is in such a state after only one blow...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) This made Suphia&#39;s departure from the front inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil thought that it was fortuitous that he was not dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he was naive to think so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil is a warrior, and he does not have a taste for unnecessarily hurting his defeated opponents. Moreover, it is against Gabil&#39;s aesthetics to deliberately finish a fighter after the victory is assured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, Gabil also understands that there are those who think it is just to kill the enemy on the battlefield. However, he did not think that anyone would make unnecessary pursuit in the face of a strong enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, I had assumed that Beathop was also a skilled fighter and would not take any action that would give Gabil an opening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the reality was cruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop turned his back on Gabil and swung his raised leg toward Suphia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Geef!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a dull thud, and Suphia started to vomit blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop&#39;s foot had broken Suphia&#39;s heart. In his prolonged thought, Gabil understood exactly what had happened: he was going to die for sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Foolishly, he would give priority to the topphia even though it would give us an opening to attack... No, he must have confidence in his ability to endure.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This understanding is nothing but humiliation, but perhaps I am not wrong. With the difference in competence between Gabil and Beathop, the probability of that result seemed high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His mind is very rough, but his thoughts are calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Should he continue to play the given move and try to win, or...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(It is needless to say that he is in doubt. Rimuru-sama will praise my choice ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The decision was made in a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a gamble whether the plan would really work or not. But Gabil believed in his power without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will not let Suphia-dono die!&quot;Suphia-dono will not die! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he shouted, throwing his precious Vortex Spear at Beathop. He ran to Suphia just as Beathop avoided it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this way, Gabil unleashed his power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil is not sure if this power can affect others. But for now, there is no other way to help Suphia but to rely on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Come back, Fate! Hear my wish and work a miracle!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil prays.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He believed with all his might that Suphia would come back to life, and that he could help her with his power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Ultimate Gift &#39;Psychology King (Mood Maker)&#39; can be activated only once a day, and &#39;Change Destiny&#39; will change the tragedy to what it should be. -And the world is in a state of war.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop looks quizzically at Gabil, who is exposed in the middle of the battle but still defenseless. He quickly decides that he must have abandoned the fight when he let go of his spear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Idiot! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop scoffed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll take care of you and your friends. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop showed no mercy to his demoralized opponents. It is Beathop&#39;s belief that mercy leads to carelessness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, since low-level insectars do not have feelings, Beathop is a superior individual for understanding the concept of affection, but it is no comfort for those who are his adversaries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, a breeze dances on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop unleashes his power once again, and he aims a spindle kick at Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The alienium covering his foot-knife glowed with a dull brilliance, and it seemed that Gabil&#39;s fate was at an end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that future does not come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For fate had been altered, and Suphia had been fully restored.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re in danger, Gabil-san! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as he was resurrected, Suphia took evasive action, following his instincts of danger. As if caught up in the action, Gabil rolled on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop&#39;s kick destroyed much of the ground, but Gabil and Suphia were able to get out of danger safely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, we are saved,&quot; said Beathop. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s my line. I thought I was dead, but Gabil-san saved my life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. It was a risky move, but I&#39;m glad it worked!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps feeling relieved to have escaped from the crisis, the two men exchanged a few light words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Beathop is alive and well, and the real battle is yet to come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...? I thought for sure you killed him, but how are you safe?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I like to explain, but I won&#39;t tell you!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I like to explain, but I won&#39;t tell you! I&#39;ll make sure I get him next time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop broke off the conversation and tried to put all his strength into his body again. But Gabil interrupted him and laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s impossible. I noticed that your power cannot be used continuously, can it? Otherwise, there would be no reason for you to waste time talking with us. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil said confidently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop&#39;s speed is faster than Apito&#39;s and the power of its fists and kicks is as heavy as Geld&#39;s. It can also accelerate and kick rapidly. Moreover, Beathop&#39;s irregular movements, such as sudden acceleration and then sudden stop, were so exquisite that even Apito could not imitate them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is very difficult to recognize such anomalies, and it is almost impossible to avoid them. That is why, on the contrary, Gabil wondered about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Even Apito-dono said that it was easy to accelerate but difficult to stop suddenly. Hinata-dono used magic to twist the law of inertia to make his mysterious movements possible, but there is no sign of magic in this one. Then, we can think of the following)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Either the control of laws by a special power, or the use of force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these two options in mind, Gabil continued his observation, and noticed that Beathop was causing his body to undergo &#39;Ultraspeed Regeneration&#39; each time he finished attacking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Beathop was demonstrating his ability to fight beyond his limits by using forceful techniques.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this is the case, there is only one way to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you keep on attacking with unreasonable force, Beathop will destroy itself. All Gabil has to do is to concentrate on defense and wait for that moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this is an attack by a superior player beyond the limit. He would be killed instantly by a single blow if he is not careful, and he would be walking on a tightrope that is too dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop&#39;s Limit Break attack, which cost him his life, is several times faster than Apito&#39;s and can kill Gabil with a single blow, depending on where it hits. A limb is sure to be damaged, and even a scratch is a big deal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil thought it would be difficult to continue to deal with such an attack, which is why he asked Beathop himself to rethink his tactics.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even without the Limit Break attack, Beathop is the better player. Gabil hoped that if he showed that he had been exposed, he might be able to return to his traditional tactics.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An awkward silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was broken by Beathop&#39;s loud laughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gahahaaha! That&#39;s good, that&#39;s good! Really, you never let me get tired of you even though you are so weak. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After laughing like that, Beathop&#39;s mood changed again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I admit it. I&#39;ll admit it... but I&#39;ll take you seriously!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bet failed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil thought it was a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had made a big show of pretending, and now he could not back out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil had Suphia behind him. Running away was out of the question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, I had no choice but to leave it to my luck and do my best to get out of this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(At least, if I had a Vortex Spear in my hand...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spear, the lizardmen&#39;s treasure, had been thrown away a while ago. He wanted to pick it up, but he didn&#39;t think Beathop would allow him to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil was determined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the very moment when he had his full attention...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gabil-sama, you lost something!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sukerou&#39;s voice came out and the Vortex Spear was back in Gabil&#39;s hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;ve been fighting with us for a long time, haven&#39;t you? Don&#39;t let go of it anymore. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sukerou said in a good-humored way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s right. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kakushin nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, yes! Gabil-sama is the best with that, you know!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yashichi made a reckless request as usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the Vortex Spear in his hand was shaking as he nodded in return.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You guys...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hot tears welled up in Gabil&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Hmm? What&#39;s that? Why is it pulsing like a spear&#39;s heartbeat?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he realized something very important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gabil-sama, I believe in you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I do!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gabil-sama, you&#39;ll show me something cool, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Expectations from the three of them are heavy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was more like a push than a cheer... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yashichi, in particular, was very serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He pushed Gabil to the edge without realizing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil, no longer thinking about the spears, was as usual strong and puffed out his chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, something unusual happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia cheered him on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I agree with you. Gabil-san, they are right. You&#39;re as good-looking as Karion-sama, in my opinion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a bombshell for Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I&#39;m as good-looking as Karion-sama,&quot; was the bombshell for Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill002.jpg" src="images/image36.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia&#39;s voice rang out in Gabil&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He couldn&#39;t think of anything else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Beathop, the great enemy and threat in front of him, is out of Gabil&#39;s mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because, you know, it can&#39;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil has never been popular with the ladies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behind his back, he had been looked at with a certain amount of favor, but the thing is, Gabil is a good-natured guy. There was no room for a good mood, as he could not see the subtleties of a woman&#39;s heart. So, until now, I had been renewing my &quot;no girlfriend&quot; record.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then came the &#39;cool&#39; comment from Suphia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the most important moment of decision in Gabil&#39;s life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I have no other choice but to say it! If I don&#39;t do this, I&#39;ll never have a girlfriend...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil gathers his courage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They say that facing death stimulates the instinct to procreate, and this must have been exactly what Gabil was doing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, I mean...what is it? I, too, have been thinking that Suphia-dono is, uh, beautiful...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At a time when he should have been mourning in despair, on this battlefield where he was so out of place, he made his confession to Suphia. He had done it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a pity that my courage was exhausted in an instant, and I whispered more and more. The fact that he could not say his confession until the end is also typical of Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, however.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, to Gabil&#39;s surprise, Suphia understood his feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? Are you serious... you think I&#39;m pretty?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She said she was beautiful, not pretty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia was also in a panic in this extreme situation. As a proof, her tone of voice changed from &quot;I&quot; to &quot;I&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a sense, they were a perfect match for each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, you are right!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil, you were right not to deny it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you had done so, your destiny would have been different. However, by choosing the correct answer, the goddess of fortune turned around for Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t help it now, Gabil-san... I&#39;ll give you a kiss as a reward after I beat him and this battle is over!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia was so excited that she did not understand what she was saying. She was so excited that she didn&#39;t understand what she was saying. She was carried away by the situation and made a terrible declaration, but she didn&#39;t realize it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Gabil is different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had Suphia&#39;s words firmly in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Do you want to kiss me? (Does he mean &quot;kiss&quot; as in &quot;kiss,&quot; not as in &quot;beat me up&quot; ? )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) This is an unprecedented event.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil&#39;s brain is in full gear and he is in a panic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yashichi, Kakushin, and Sukerou were cheering Gabil up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gabil-sama, you are irresistible!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Huw ! I&#39;m surprised. I knew you were a man of action, but confessing your love on the battlefield is too bold!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right! This is exactly the way of life of a man!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabbil! Ah-sore, Gabbir! Ah there ! &#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As usual, Gabil&#39;s ondo bursts out, and he can&#39;t stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil abandons his thoughts and his body starts dancing on its own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has been repeated so many times that it has become a conditioned reflex.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, he is in a happy fantasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I was so happy and full of fantasies. I finally have a girlfriend. It&#39;s hard to be a popular guy ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) It was too soon to tell, but Gabil&#39;s fantasy was not revealed to anyone.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop was not able to resist Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first, I thought it was a trap, but the three who came to the scene showed no sign of taking cover.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was convenient. Beathop&#39;s forced movements had increased his fighting ability beyond his capabilities, so he actually had no time to spare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, with &#39;Ultraspeed Regeneration&#39; his injuries would heal quickly, but the problem was that his energy was being drained too quickly. He thought that he could recover his strength and finish them off at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the reason why I had allowed Gabil and the others to make a farce of themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now, I am in good physical condition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop resumed his onslaught on Gabil. Or rather, he was going to finish him off with a single blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Ignore me, you&#39;re just spouting nonsense. Fine. I&#39;ll show you what I&#39;m talking about!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a rage, Beathop delivered a special flying spindle kick to Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, however, something amazing happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then something amazing happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, stop interfering ! This is the most important moment of my life !!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil shouted and hit Beathop with a spear. Just like that, Beathop was blown away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an unbelievable event. Beathop opened all his compound eyes in astonishment and shouted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What have you done ? &quot;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Gabil did not hear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Suphia-dono, is that what you call chew?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia understood what she had said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was embarrassed, but she could not back out now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, oh. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s it.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said it as if to tell myself it was no big deal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil nods again and again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir! I swear I will win with all my might!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil was inspired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hopelessness is long gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not whether we can win, but whether we will win. With this spirit, he glared at Beathop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t you dare, you little fish!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil&#39;s attitude made Beathop furious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thinks that Gabil is far inferior to him and has the nerve to be so cocky. At the same time, however, he has not forgotten the strange phenomenon that just occurred. Although he thought it was just a coincidence, he was on the lookout for any eventuality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Was it really a coincidence? I attacked him many times with the intention of killing him. I wasn&#39;t holding back, and I felt I had a chance to finish them off. So how are they still alive?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop&#39;s instincts told him that this was no coincidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop was more dangerous than he thought and braced himself for it. Gabil, on the other hand, was excited that he might be able to get a girlfriend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were prepared for the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel sorry for Beathop, but the world is always absurd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Here I come!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil shouts with a crisp expression on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop silently greets him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the next moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two men cross each other again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop spins his whole body like a cone in a super-fast flight with more power than he can handle. All of his power is concentrated into the poisoned needles of alienium protruding from the tips of his fists - this is Beathop&#39;s special technique, the flying whirling needle thrust. This was Beathop&#39;s special technique, Spindle Needle Spear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil, on the other hand, was holding up his Vortex Spear, true to the basics. He was not panicking or making a fuss, but carefully watching for the beatop, and then he delivered a desperate blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two large vortices swell and collide on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, it is Beathop who falls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Vortex Crash!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil&#39;s special move pierced through Beathop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, my God!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gabil-sama, that&#39;s so cool!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, it&#39;s a good one!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was no wonder that the three of them were surprised and praised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil&#39;s offensive was so overwhelming that it seemed as if the previous struggles had been for nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beathop was not careless or complacent. And yet, this was the result.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The secret was the Vortex Spear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil was so occupied with his confession to Suphia that he did not realize that Vortex Spear had evolved to a mythical-grade in a critical situation. And of course, Gabil was mainly recognized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, Gabil&#39;s presence value exceeded that of Beathop in total. Since the teams were almost equal in terms of skill, Gabil was able to win the competition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil! Oh, that&#39;s it, Gabil! Oh, there ! &#39;, Gabil said to the cheers of the three players. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil dances to the tune of victory while being cheered by the three members.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suphia was also smiling as she watched, but she suddenly remembered the promise she had just made and blushed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil notices Suphia&#39;s blush, too, and the two look at each other and stiffen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It looks like we&#39;re intruders, don&#39;t you think?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, indeed.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good luck, Gabil-sama!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these words, the three left quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil and Suphia were not happy to be left behind, but surprisingly, the two were a perfect match... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The suspension bridge effect on the battlefield helped, and it did not take long for them to be honest with each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thus, spring came to Gabil.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.lnxbz9"></a><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The death of Insect General Torun triggered a major change in the battlefield, but it was not just about Gabil and his men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion, Midley, and Obera were also watching the situation, fearing that the balance of power on the battlefield would be upset. At this point, they made a decisive decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion was the first to make a move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Frey won. Well, of course, I can&#39;t lose either. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He smiled wryly and stared at Abart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abart, who had many limbs, was good not only at close combat but also at magic combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His arms, covered with an exoskeleton that had reached alienium, could pierce his enemies sharper than a spear. Not only that, but by using his free hand to make a sign, he can also perform magic without chanting spells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first glance, this combination of magic and unique physical techniques might seem to put Karion in a difficult situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the reality is different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion was looking for an opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could he save his special move, the Burst Roar, and beat Karion with less consumption? While thinking about this, Karion was searching for Abart&#39;s weak points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as they started fighting, Karion realized that he had the advantage. However, he did not take it easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abart&#39;s strength was real, and if he was not careful, Karion might be defeated. Moreover, I did not want to cause him unnecessary injuries by rushing the game, because I had a feeling that it would be dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a matter of fact, it was the right choice. Abart was a special individual who entered a runaway state when he was about to run out of energy, and his attack power and recovery power tripled. If that had happened, Karion would have had a hard time and, worst of all, would have lost the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Karion was able to maintain the battle line without any danger because of his wild intuition. He also recognized Abart&#39;s habit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion, who knew how long it would take for the magic to be used again and how long it would take for the spear to be fully extended before it was returned to its original position, waited for Abart to simultaneously activate both of them. Finally, the moment arrived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey&#39;s defeat of Insect General Torun triggered Abart&#39;s impatience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve been waiting for you. Beast Roar!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion&#39;s technique pierced Abart&#39;s torso. The flash of magic particles widened its range of effect and completely engulfed Abart.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley had a very calm view of the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not care about Insect General Saril standing in front of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley was in perfect control of his body, always exerting only a certain amount of force. In some cases, he even adjusted his body to the same level as that of his opponent, enjoying the act of fighting more purely. In this respect alone, Midley is in the same league as Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s exactly why Midley was so much fun to play against Saril this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmmm.... You are not so bold. You seem to be confident of your poison, but it won&#39;t work on me. If you can&#39;t get through with your attack style relying on your poisonous tail, what will you do now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said to Saril in an agitated manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn, you&#39;re cocky!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saril snapped at the mercy of Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, although the power of the attack has been increased by his anger, it is meaningless if it does not hit the target. Saril, whose actions have become monotonous, is at Midley&#39;s mercy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would have been easy just to finish him off. Midley did not do so because he was aware of the eerie atmosphere that covered the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;What is this sticky feeling? Hmm, they are probing my power. Well, have you lost interest? That means you can kill me any time you want...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This presence reminded me of Milim, whom Midley worships.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there was none of the warmth of Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was cold and devoid of any emotion...an eerie presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley dared to keep Saril alive in order to find out his true identity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Well, Obera-dono is a good man, isn&#39;t he? (Hmmm, Obera-dono is a smart guy. He has noticed this presence as well as I have.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera, too, is watching the battlefield without defeating Insect General who is facing him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the difference in power is such that they can be defeated at once, it seems that they are aiming at the same thing as Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The others do not seem to notice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not to mention Carrera who is dealing with the enemy general Zess. They are fighting a fierce battle in which there is no room for others to intervene, and it seems that they do not have time to worry about unnecessary matters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same goes for Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Insect General, an anthropomorphic giant centipede, was second only to Peliod in terms of presence, and seemed to be almost equal to Geld. It is no wonder that they could not afford to worry about other places, and Midley did not want to cause them unnecessary concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta and Ranga against Peliod, for example, may be too much concerned about the superiority of the enemy in front of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Midley is truly thankful that this duo has come to his team. Midley was thinking that he had to rescue Phobio and Esprit because they would have lost their lives if they had not. However, he could not move because of the eerie presence in the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley thought of returning the favor to Gobta by offering to help him with his training later, even though it would seem like an unnecessary favor from Gobta&#39;s point of view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, after a prolonged standoff, the situation finally moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey defeated Insect General Torun, Gabil took out Beathop, and Karion took out Abart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley sensed that the atmosphere of misery on the battlefield had become more intense and dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For unknown reasons, something bad was happening. I was convinced of this and braced myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My colleagues, Karion and Frey, also seem to have finally sensed the presence of an ominous presence after defeating the Insect General they were dealing with. I guess they had instinctively realized it, but now they have become convinced of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I guess those two are not ready yet. (Their fighting style is better, but they need to learn to pay more attention to their surroundings, otherwise it will be difficult for them to follow Milim-sama.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a rather harsh evaluation, but it is Midley&#39;s true feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kekeke. How dare you lick my face! It was a backhanded move, but it&#39;s OK.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saril went berserk at Midley, who seemed uninterested in him. He stuck his poisonous tail into his own body and activated overdrive at his own will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Against Saril, whose strength and speed had increased several times, even Midley could no longer afford to play with him. With a very bad feeling in his heart, he decided to end the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley was strong when he got serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He tied the oncoming Saril with his massive fighting aura? toki, stopping him from moving. He then delivered a killing blow to his helpless foe, and Saril&#39;s body was crushed to dust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Insta-kill. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He showed his face as a man strong enough to be Milim&#39;s playmate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Midley&#39;s expression was gloomy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t like it. I&#39;ve got the chills, after all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley looked up at the sky, which had been darkened before he knew it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His back was telling him that killing Saril had been a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Midley guessed, Obera was also in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It&#39;s not right. The pressure from the enemy has not changed since the beginning of the war...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera treated Tishorn as a child against the vicious Tishorn that cuts off everything by vibrating the alienium exoskeletons of both arms. The reason why she did not put the finishing touches on Tishorn was because she had the same concern as Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many lives are lost on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The damage to her allies was minimized by the use of restorative medicine, and they were quickly replaced by their replacements, so that no one died. However, the insectar army is repeating the onslaught without regard to the loss of life, and has already been reduced to less than half of its initial strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, the enemy force, which Obera sensed with his &#39;super intuition&#39;, was still alive and well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment when Frey defeated Torun was the moment when this feeling of discomfort became a certainty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although one of the enemy generals had been defeated, nothing had changed. This means that even the death of Insect General has no effect on the army of insectar - or maybe worse than that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, it is even possible that the death of Insect General itself is one of the enemy&#39;s tricks... (No way, right? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;No way, right? (No, that&#39;s not true...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We cannot say for sure that this is not the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once, my colleague Zalario complained about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are really persistent. He said, &quot;You have to choose the right place, because it&#39;s a nuisance to beat them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that time, I thought it was a rare occurrence for the taciturn Zalario, and I only felt that he seemed to be tired, but now I realize that the meaning of his comment was very important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had already decided that it was not my job to deal with insectar, so I had no intention to consult with him from the beginning and did not listen to what he had to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not only Obera&#39;s problem but also the vice of phantom as a whole, led by Feldway, but Obera regretted that they should have informed each other at least of major problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is too late for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he knew nothing about the enemy, he had no choice but to be flexible and seek the most appropriate response. With this in mind, Obera continued to observe the battlefield while dealing with Tishorn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battlefield moved quickly without any decisive moves being made.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Torun was followed by Beathop, and Abart was scattered. Even though so many enemy generals fell, the enemy&#39;s strength did not decrease even slightly. With the result so far, there was no room to doubt that this was a part of the enemy&#39;s strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It is dangerous. (It is dangerous. We should not defeat Insect General any further.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(We should not defeat Insect General any further...) Although this is an enemy that must be defeated, the priority is safety. If something unforeseen was happening, they should take their time to eliminate the cause of their anxiety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera tried to warn them, but it was a little too late. At that time, even Midley had already taken care of Saril.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only four Insect Generals remained: Tishorn, whom Obera was facing, Mujika, whom Geld was holding off, Peliod, whom Gobta and Ranga were struggling with, and finally, Zess, who was fighting with Carrera in another dimension. Half of them had already been defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera&#39;s expression like a noh mask turned dark for a moment, as if something bad was about to happen. Tishorn did not miss it and laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, I see you&#39;ve noticed. A lowly Insect General is just a front runner. With your help, it won&#39;t affect the big picture whether they&#39;re here or not. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he says, Tishorn is the top Insect General. He is the fourth most powerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tishorn&#39;s existence value is a little over 1.8 million, which is not that much different from Beathop. Even so, the fact that she has been the top executive of the Insect General for a long time proves her power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Midaregiri&quot; (slash to a thousand dimensional slashes) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shock waves emitted from Tishorn&#39;s arms become cutting surfaces that slice through everything in all directions. The effect of the shockwaves extends to the dimension, and although the dimensional rupture is instantly reversed by the healing power of the world, it is impossible for the materials existing on the ruptured surface to withstand the rupture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, even Obera is no exception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera, however, recognized Tishorn as a threat even though Obera could see it at a glance and did not make a mistake to suffer such an attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he was still aware that Tishorn was a threat, and he was trying to minimize the damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Midaregiri&quot; (a slash of 1,000 cuts) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again Tishorn unleashes his technique, and a vicious shockwave comes flying in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera was gradually becoming impatient while avoiding it with ease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Like a fool, you keep repeating attacks that don&#39;t work, don&#39;t you? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hohoho, this is an interesting thing you say. It&#39;s not you but me who decides what works and what doesn&#39;t.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tishorn&#39;s reply was right on the money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one is a fool to believe the words of the enemy. If I thought it would not work, I would have stopped it long ago. Tishorn is repeating the same attack because he thinks it works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Obera did not like it either, that is why he tried to stop them by encouraging them to say that it is useless. Failing that, Obera reconsidered Tishorn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(He is really used to fighting, taking Optimal Action without any hesitation, isn&#39;t he? It would be easy to win, but to neutralize Tishorn without killing him, it would be tough even for me...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera has already seen through Tishorn&#39;s ability. The gap between her and Tishorn was wide, and she could say without a doubt that Tishorn was a lower rank. However, this was only if she had not been injured in the battle with Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is true that Obera&#39;s wounds are all healed and he is in good physical condition. However, he had not fully replenished his lost energy, and he was in a far from perfect condition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Otherwise, Tishorn would have been incapacitated long ago. The failure to do so is the reason for the current result.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still - there was no time left for hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your Highness, please look at us!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tishorn exclaims, and at the same time, her fighting ability increases dramatically. Like Insect General Saril, she has voluntarily caused overdrive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there was a difference from Saril.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tishorn has complete control over the overdrive and can effectively utilize the time limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Midaregiri - Mai of the End&quot;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an incomparable attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A spectacular scene unfolded, with more than 10,000 dimensional ruptures, making it impossible for any human being to escape from this space of death and destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera&#39;s only action was not to run away from the scene, but to stand tall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera gave up trying to neutralize Tishorn and decided to give it his all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Release the god&#39;s chi!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera lightly announces, &quot;I&#39;m going to release Tishorn. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the signal for Obera to give her all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mythical-grade that he had been wearing regained its starry radiance. The circulation of Obera&#39;s mana has restored its full performance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in Obera&#39;s hand, a huge double-edged sword is held.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the result of the transformation of the &quot;Beast Slayer&quot;-Obera&#39;s favorite long sword-into its true form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Against Obera&#39;s arch-enemy, cryptid, we must put aside the idea of taking it easy. If we are so lenient, the damage will continue to increase.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We always tried our best to eliminate cryptids with optimum efficiency. Therefore, once Obera decides to fight, it has no choice but to destroy the enemy without regard to the damage to the surroundings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now, her true value of more than 20 million existence was about to be demonstrated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ho-ho-ho, it&#39;s too late to be serious now!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Tishorn said, Obera is already trapped in the deadly space. Since Tishorn&#39;s blockage prevented her from escaping through &#39;Spatial Transportation&#39;, there was no way to avoid being cut to pieces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It should have been so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the result was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This attack is nothing less than a child&#39;s play. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is true that the space was torn by the direct hit of the dimensional slash. And yet, just as the space regressed back to its original form, Obera&#39;s body was also beautifully restored to its original state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Bah, idiot!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My body is connected not only to the material world but also to the spiritual world. This is nothing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera explains in a calm manner and raises mana as if it is his turn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &quot;Beastslayer&quot; shines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the dangerous light, Tishorn is confused by the emotion that arises for the first time in his life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;His body trembled. Don&#39;t tell me, don&#39;t tell me that I am afraid? Are you saying that I am frightened ? )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) I understand so, but it is too late. There was nothing Tishorn could do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Disappear, and be beautiful! Planetes Booming!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A massive slash indiscriminately poured down from the heavens, dispersing a merciless yet fair death. Tishorn, too, was caught up in it and vanished into dust, unable even to show the dignity of a strong man.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld was struggling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy he faced was Insect General Mujika.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika is a warrior-type insect majin (insector), clad in a garishly colored shell like warrior&#39;s armor and wielding a sword with both hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika&#39;s strength was equal to that of Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both men never gave an inch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And their subordinates are also fighting back and forth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Yellow Numbers and Orange Numbers, who maintain an ironclad line of defense, push back a swarm of giant centipedes more than 30 meters in length led by Mujika. Because of the difference in size, teams were formed to deal with each centipede.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they are injured, they heal themselves with healing medicine, and when they get tired, they switch with those in the rear to maintain the front line while avoiding overworking themselves. This was the result of their regular training.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, the battle remained in a stalemate even after several hours had passed, but the most notable moment was the one-on-one battle between Geld and Mujika.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika wielded a dagger with the skill of a first-rate martial artist, and judging from the high level of her skill, it was hard to believe that she had developed this technique on her own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that there were reincarnated people in the &quot;other world,&quot; but that is not important. What was certain was that Mujika was a strong opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld catches the sword with his big shield. The shield is also a gem that has become a part of Geld and reached a mythical-grade. It is like Geld&#39;s flesh and blood, and has been transformed to have properties similar to the exoskeleton of the insectoid majin (insector).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, even a slight damage is instantly repaired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The atmosphere shakes and plasma scatters, but Geld keeps a cool face. In return, he reaves Mujika with a meat crusher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika, however, is also a great fighter, and she anticipates the attack and parries it with her sword. Not only that, his countless legs pop out from the gaps in his armor, and he unleashes a barrage of blows as if piercing the Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld, who seemed to be on the verge of a crisis, responded with &#39;Demon Lord Haki&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld&#39;s haki, which was given the &#39;Corrosion&#39; effect by the Ultimate Gift &#39;Gourmet King Beelzebub Chaos Eater&#39;, which was given the &#39;Corrosion&#39; effect by the Ultimate Gift &#39;Gourmet King Beelzebub&#39;, bites Mujika&#39;s leg with erratic movements, as if it had a will of its own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika&#39;s leg was not defeated either, and it was covered with the evil youki and canceled out Geld&#39;s chaos-eaters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These battles were repeated, and the situation was still unsettled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the battle suddenly came to an end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hm. Even Tishorn is dead. No way. I didn&#39;t think our forces here were this strong, but now you are ready. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s none of your business. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve met a warrior who could compete with me. I&#39;d have liked to compete with you more, but I think it&#39;s time to move on. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika says unilaterally and distances herself from Geld. Then, he showed his retreat with the surviving bugs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld does not let his guard down even though he sees this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, Geld also notices.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;The atmosphere of the battlefield is strange. Is this intense fear a sign that something is about to happen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was so overwhelmingly dangerous that I wondered why I had not noticed it before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld stares at the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dark clouds were swirling, and it seemed as if something was about to appear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;All hands, maintain full alert!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld&#39;s order causes even those who are being treated to start moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld&#39;s ever-present and ever-more determined appearance made everyone understand that the battle was not over.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as Phobio was rescued, Gobua was eager to rebuild the front.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under Benimaru&#39;s guidance, Gobua has developed into a first-rate commander. In the large-scale combat training in the labyrinth, he is able to train in all kinds of gruesome tactics, and is far more experienced than any tactician.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three hundred &quot;Kurenai&quot; in Gobua&#39;s charge are also veterans who grew up together with Gobua. They did not need to be ordered by Gobua to take the best course of action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although they were only a few reinforcements in number, the situation of the war was greatly improved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again, the presence or absence of a commander can affect the war situation by itself. With Phobio&#39;s return to the front and his command, the &quot;flying cavalry&quot; regained its vigor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the Milim forces gradually gained the upper hand... </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the midst of this turnaround, Gobta was dying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod, whom he faced, was an unbelievably bad guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The poisonous mist was a deadly poison that would kill even Gobta, who had a high level of resistance to poison. It was not a small level that you would die if you drank it, but one that melts your skin and burns your flesh just by touching it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The slightest contact with the skin caused extreme pain. Thanks to this, Gobta realized the danger of the poisonous mist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Oh, no! Dying, you&#39;ll be dead for sure ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">), he decided within less than 30 seconds of the start of the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, without hesitation, I asked Ranga who came to support me, and decided to use my secret move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magic Wolf Unification!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without a moment&#39;s delay, he &#39;identified&#39; with Ranga.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Gobta and Ranga were transformed into a sinister two-horned humanoid black wolf, and it was the right decision. If they had been a little late in their decision, Gobta would have been killed in the battle, if not Ranga.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, then, let&#39;s do it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Gobta, you can use my power to your heart&#39;s content. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first, the two men were excited, but their enthusiasm soon faded away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason was simple: Peliod was too strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta and Ranga&#39;s &#39;identification&#39; does not mean that their fighting ability increases that much. The combination of Ranga&#39;s potential and Gobta&#39;s fighting sense only makes them more powerful than the sum of their abilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, since Gobta&#39;s presence is not so large, it is almost as if there is no change in the numbers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod, on the other hand, is an eerie presence from the standpoint of its position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its existence value was 6.8 million, more than 15 times larger than that of &#39;identical&#39; Gobta &amp; Ranga, and was the second largest after Zess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only that, he is an extraordinary spatialist who can reflect even Carrera&#39;s &quot;Abyss Annihilation&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with his backhand, he was far superior to Carrera&#39;s &quot;Abyss Annihilation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why they were not defeated immediately was that Gobta and his team were good at physical close combat, while Peliod was good at magical mid-range and long-range combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, from the beginning of the battle until now, Gobta had been in a tense situation where they could not relax. Thanks to the fact that they barely maintained the distance that they were good at, they were able to play a reasonably close game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this was about to end when Peliod changed his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Gobta, have you noticed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh no, Ranga-san, isn&#39;t he getting stronger and stronger?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta and Ranga are concerned about the state of Peliod, who is facing them right now. Compared to the beginning of the battle, there was a sign that her fighting ability was increasing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a proof, she was responding to the moves of the Gobtas more and more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her feints were no longer working, and she was losing the time to attack. Peliod&#39;s sharp attacks were beginning to reach Gobta&#39;s team, though not to the extent that they were on the defensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod had changed from the monotonous attacks of the past to a more deadly one by one attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;I think it&#39;s a foul to grow during the battle, isn&#39;t it? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;It is a common thing. I&#39;ve been there myself and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the enemy is like that...&#39;&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Well, it is true, but I think it&#39;s unreasonable when it happens to me...&#39;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they have to be careful not to let it get to that point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta knows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the reinforcements, and no more help will come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru, whom Gobta respects and who is always there for him, is also fighting on a different battlefield. This time, the enemy was so powerful that we could not expect any help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If anything, there is a possibility that Benimaru may come. However, Gobta would prefer not to do so, since it would put the home country at risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Well, we have to do it by ourselves. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I agree. If the enemy is strong, we should be stronger than them!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so they settled on the gut feeling in the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was not good for a commander, but it was a reason for Gobta to push himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the saying goes, &quot;a backwater position,&quot; and for Gobta, who was always on the run, a situation in which he could not run away helped him to push himself harder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;From here on, I&#39;m going to fight in the short term!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With such enthusiasm, he accelerated his attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, all of them ended in a blank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He even launched a two-stage attack, &quot;Dance with Wolves&quot; to taunt Peliod, and at the same time, he unleashed a special attack, &quot;Apocalypse Howling&quot;, in a desperate attempt to win. But even that was evaded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&#65288;But even that was evaded. This was a secret training, a special one ! )</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.35nkun2"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta was also concerned about this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Gobta, shouldn&#39;t you step back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta opposed to such a proposal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta opposed the proposal. If we leave now, Carrera-san will have to bear too much burden. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga agreed with Gobta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since reinforcements were not expected, one option was to run away to regroup, but it was a last resort. This is not a duel but a war, and fleeing before the enemy would have too great an impact on the whole situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, as long as they could not use the desperate move, they would be left with no choice but to lose the game. Gobta, who hates to lose as much as anyone else, tries to avoid such a situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he could not come up with any good ideas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll help you, Gobta. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion, who had defeated Insect General Abart, joined the battle because he saw that Gobta was at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that was not all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll help you, too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Frey, who saw the danger of Peliod, rushed to the scene and offered to fight with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a fair fight, but this is not a one-on-one battle but a war. Victory should take precedence over honor, and Gobta welcomed the offer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank God!&quot; he exclaimed happily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he exclaimed happily, and the battle was now renewed.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-And everyone thought so.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m so sad. Very, very sad. My children were so weak.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The monster&#39;s mutter was not loud, but it reached the ears of all those present on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone present understood that this was the signal for the final round.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera was fighting an evenly matched battle against Zess, the leader of the Insect General.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Zess was a strong opponent, he was not an opponent that Carrera could not win. He was a good opponent and enjoyed the fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera showed off his recently acquired skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Golden Gun and sword, the same fighting style as Lieutenant Chikando, suited Carrera well. The movements were so natural and effortless that one could be convinced that Carrera has been an expert for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, Carrera was accustomed to fighting against the insectoid majin (insector). This was the reason why Carrera was not even a step ahead of them, even though it should have been her weak point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, Zess was very similar to someone Carrera knew well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From his back to the exoskeleton that covered his entire body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although their fighting methods are quite different, the quality of their techniques, and the presence of a strong man who overpowers others, are just like that of Zegion, whom Carrera has recognized as his rival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, Zess has a tremendous presence. It easily surpasses Carrera&#39;s existence, and is almost three times as large as Zegion&#39;s. However, in terms of threat level, Zegion is not as big as Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Carrera felt that Zegion was superior in terms of threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had fought against Zegion many times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Carrera was able to outthink Zess even though he had never seen Zegion before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, he does not have the limitations he had imposed on himself now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zegion&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t target parts made of Rimuru&#39;s cells&quot;, the crazy rule that Diablo had come up with, did not apply to Zess. This is the reason why Carrera is able to give his all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the beginning of the battle, there was an obstacle called Peliod. However, Esprit and his team did their best to get rid of him. They are trying their best to do their best against a superior opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well, my friends are putting in a lot of effort, so I can&#39;t show them how bad I look!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera was enjoying the mortal combat with Zess, as if she was releasing her boiling emotions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The blades, aiming at the gaps in the shell, cut through Zess&#39;s body tissues. In addition, between the dancing sword blows, close-range bullets pierced through Zess&#39;s compound eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Little by little, the battle was tilting in Carrera&#39;s favor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ha-ha-ha, this is fun!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, you devilish devil! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re a strong fighter, but not as strong as Zegion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zegion is my acknowledged rival, but my battles with him are nothing like this. I&#39;ve fought him for days on end and never been able to put a scratch on him.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with the rules that don&#39;t make sense, Zegion&#39;s strength is extraordinary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess is indeed strong, but Carrera&#39;s attacks were hitting him several times. Carrera was convinced that if they continued the battle, he would surely win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That means you&#39;re weaker than me.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nonsense. Then let&#39;s show them how serious we are. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s words were enough to wound Zess&#39;s pride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Converting his anger into energy, Zess turned his murderous intent on Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyone below A rank could be killed with just a glance. No, even for a greater majin, there was a violent pressure that could have been fatal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, however, brushed it off with a cool air. In return, Carrera himself raised his mana, improved his haki, and hit Zess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The high spirits of the two heroes pressed against each other, and a huge vortex was formed on the battlefield. Those who touched the vortex were engulfed by the tremendous mana wave, and their lives were taken away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Milim camp had anticipated this danger, and no one approached Carrera. However, the insectars, who had filled the battlefield in great numbers, were greatly reduced in number by the vortex.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess takes a step forward, and Carrera intercepts him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess&#39;s fist ripped into Carrera&#39;s cheek, and Carrera&#39;s sword sliced through a gap in Zess&#39;s exoskeleton.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess makes a kick that slaughters even the greater majin with a single blow. Unafraid of this, Carrera dives into Zess&#39;s pocket and fires his Golden Gun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bullet from close range pierces through a gap in Zess&#39;s exoskeleton, opening a hole. Immediately after that, however, Zess&#39;s kick, which seemed to have struck out of the sky, was aimed at Carrera&#39;s head and swung down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Tsk!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera barely had time to react and save her head, but it was not enough, and she was kicked in the shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I missed!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I am ashamed that I made a mistake.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s left shoulder was shattered, but she still had a wry smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although she regrets that she was injured when she intended to defeat Zess with no damage, she does not expect to be defeated by Zess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After several hours of battle, Carrera had seen through Zess&#39;s habits. Nevertheless, Zess&#39;s power was real, and Carrera would be defeated if he was not careful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had to accumulate damage little by little to ensure victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera stares down at Zess with an imposing look. His uniform is torn at the shoulder, revealing his white skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. The blood has already stopped flowing, and he is completely healed as if he had never been injured from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same is true for Zess, whose wounds inflicted by Carrera have all healed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For transcendent beings like Carrera and Zess, half-damage is meaningless. The decisive factor is how efficiently they can exhaust their opponents, and the opponent who shows a big opening is at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera has a big move (abyssal annihilation) in his first move, and he has less energy than Zess. Therefore, I thought I would be very careful from this point on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I know the skill level of Zess. He is strong, but I will win.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera decided that there was no need to push himself anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, he noticed a change in the atmosphere of the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;What is it? What is this feeling? Milim-sama was on alert, so I left it to him.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim-sama was on guard, so Carrera could do whatever he wanted. That&#39;s why we didn&#39;t notice it until later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it is not only that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The main reason is that Zess was so powerful that he did not have enough time to pay attention to his surroundings. And it was a situation that Zess had intended to cause.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;ku ku ku, you noticed. You are strong. I admit it, but we will win. This is not a duel, it&#39;s war. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera raises his eyebrows in displeasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess did not care, but raised his right hand and pointed in a certain direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Look.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera does not look back, but uses his &#39;Magic Perception&#39; to explore the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, she would know the meaning of Zess&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Gobta&#39;s eyes, Peliod was transformed beautifully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although she had always had an unusual and beautiful appearance, now Peliod is transformed into a mysterious and beautiful woman in everyone&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it is not a change but an evolution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod&#39;s scars accumulated from the battle have been torn open, and a beautiful woman with beautiful &#39;skin&#39; has emerged from under the scars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How do you do? I am Peliod, queen of the bugs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even her speech had become fluent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was obvious that she had become a supernatural being, different from the ones she had been fighting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was no wonder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Peliod was the vice king of the Insectar and the female emperor who truly rules the Insect General.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that she had revealed herself, Gobta&#39;s chances of victory were as good as lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me, really...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta muttered his true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not like we&#39;re getting stronger or anything. This is not the time to say that we should be stronger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What are you going to do then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta asked Ranga in return, and Ranga seemed to be at a loss for words. But then, as if he had made up his mind, he spoke his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have no choice but to run away. Gobta, you also feel he is dangerous, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta is stumped by the blunt answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I think so... but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to escape by ourselves...&#39; he says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta, too, thinks Ranga is right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod, who had been fighting earlier, might have had a chance to win depending on the way they fought. But now, there is no chance at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So much so that the current Peliod has an overwhelming presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She calls herself a queen, and she is beyond the power of all Insect Generals. Yes, she is even superior to Zess, the head of the Insect General that Carrera is dealing with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga and Gobta sensed it correctly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if they fought, they would lose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, they did not want to be the only ones to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they ran away, they would not be able to show their faces to their friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is hell to go, it is also hell to escape. But there was no time to worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shut up! We may look different, but we&#39;re still going to do the same thing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion was the first one to make a move, shouting &quot;I don&#39;t care if I look different, I&#39;m still going to do the same thing!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion chose the Burst Roar, his best special move. Without thinking of what would happen later, he unleashed his versatile diffuse-focused particle cannon without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion&#39;s body transformed into a particle with a will and approached Peliod, who stood tall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, an instant. Peliod does not move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not that he cannot move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, you idiot...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn&#39;t even need to move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod&#39;s breath had turned into a poisonous mist that clung to Karion in the form of particles. Peliod&#39;s breath turned into a poisonous mist that clung to Karion as he turned into a particle, and then drained him of his kinetic energy, rendering him immobile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Frey did not expect Karion&#39;s defeat at this point. He flew away from Karion&#39;s attack as a distraction and landed behind Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here was Frey&#39;s trick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to block your movement,&quot; he declared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he declared right after he grabbed Peliod with &quot;Garuda Claw&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey&#39;s &#39;Magic Interference&#39; is effective to the ultimate realm of divinity. Its power is so strong that it can block Adalmann&#39;s &#39;Necronomicon&#39;, and with her &#39;Garuda Claw&#39;, she can kill any opponent. She can block the ability of any opponent with her &quot;Garuda Claw&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-No, she should have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod smiles, even though he is in a tight spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s sad. My children were defeated by someone of this caliber.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey asks, but is immediately silenced by a hard blow to the abdomen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh, huh ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite his startled expression and bleeding, Frey follows his instinct and removes his hand from Peliod&#39;s. That saved his life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This saved Frey&#39;s life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he had believed in the Garuda Claw, the next blow from Peliod would have killed him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see, you have good intuition. The claws made me a little weak, but I could have killed him with two blows. But it makes sense now. You were experienced in combat, not in strength. Then, my children&#39;s honor will be a little better restored. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod sings as if he were singing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I can&#39;t believe... that you could so easily disable my claws. You&#39;re an unbelievable monster!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey is now convinced, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like Gobta and Ranga, this would be the place to die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same is true for Karion, who is lying on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion is so exhausted that he cannot even make a sound, and he is unable to even try to fight back. In this situation, he has no choice but to run away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Hey, I don&#39;t mean Frey&#39;s words, but I didn&#39;t expect him to be such a monster...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I regretted that I had not seen it at the beginning of the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well, even if I had seen it, what does it matter?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion says to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Come to think of it, I should have been more careful when he threw Carrera&#39;s &quot;Abyss Annihilation&quot; back at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the fault of all of us who were present that we thought that she was a mid-range and long-range magician.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(But I can&#39;t believe Milim didn&#39;t notice it either...why didn&#39;t he move? No, I see... Insect Lord Zelanus is a much more dangerous opponent...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A chill ran down Karion&#39;s back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he remembered the battle with Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why Milim, who seems to be an absolute being, does not move even in this crisis. It was obvious that the Insect Lord Zelanus was the reason, which meant that we could not expect any help from Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Is that so, damn you! Then this war...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be a disservice to our friends to even think about it from that point on. Karion thinks so and starts to think about what he can still do to help.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey is seriously injured, though not as badly as Karion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey&#39;s and Peliod&#39;s gazes cross.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey is prepared to die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Peliod is the absolute leader of this place, no one can stop her. If that is the case, Peliod should kill the weakest one. Because Frey would definitely do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I&#39;m sorry, Karion. I wanted to know more about you... but it seems I&#39;m done here.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey made up his mind and prepared himself to at least take one last shot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, a man stood in front of Frey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This man, Midley, confronts Peliod to protect Frey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s how it is. The purpose of the special &#39;Barrier&#39; that has been spreading around the battlefield is to collect the energy of your dead comrades for you?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Not only to collect. I, on the other hand, want more power so that I can give birth to stronger children.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod answered with a smile as he looked at Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was enough of an answer for Midley, and he knew that he had to get rid of Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(If we let him go, we are sure to create many more monsters like the Insect General that we have just defeated. The problem is that we are the ones who want to escape.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley&#39;s eyes still had hope in them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then, let&#39;s defeat me first!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He declared, and took a deep-crouching posture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shifted his center of gravity to his right foot and lightly moved his left foot forward. At the same time, he clenches his right fist and squeezes it at the waist, and holds his left hand out in front of him as a check against Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next moment, he exploded his power starting from the tiptoe of his left foot, and his body was a cannonball.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, from the thrust with all his might, he released a mass of fighting energy in the shape of a fist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dragon Fang Holy Fist!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He unites the energy of the earth with his own fighting spirit, which runs through his body from his toes to converge into a fist. Then he unleashes this special move - &quot;Dragonic Canon&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He does not spare any energy, but uses all his strength, and even the energy of the earth is combined with it. It is a blow tinged with divinity, powerful enough to be used against superior opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the profound essence of Midley, the greater chaos spirit &quot;Ryu majin&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, Peliod could not understand it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s an interesting move. If you learn this, your children will become stronger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a laugh, he easily deploys a magic circle to manipulate space and obliterate the Dragonic Canon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this is just as Midley expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Midley did not think that this would be the end of the game from the beginning, and his role was a decoy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course, it was Gobta who struck the real blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t forget me! I&#39;ll take this too ! I&#39;ll take this one too! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta jumped out of Midley&#39;s shadow, and at the right moment, he performed the &quot;Apocalypse Howling&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that did not work either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod was unfazed and deployed another magic circle at the same time to eliminate &quot;Apocalypse Howling&quot; as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a complete surprise attack using Midley as a decoy, but it did not reach Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there was still a glimmer of hope in the faces of Midley and Gobta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here was another true contender who had finally made his move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who else but Obera could have done it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re so proud of yourself, you little bug!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Peliod&#39;s attention was drawn to Midley and Gobta, Obera was preparing a deadly attack. He unleashed his second &quot;Planetes Booming&quot; of the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Midley and Karion, Obera&#39;s existence value is comparable to that of Peliod. Therefore, the attack would not have been safe even for Peliod - no, no. &quot;Zalario is also a wise man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Zalario was a wise man, and I knew you would be one of them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? &quot;Oh my God! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re lying... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t expect this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything was in the palm of Peliod&#39;s hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there was no time for despair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll pay you back.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod told me with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The intent was revealed by a shower of meteorites falling from the heavens. Peliod had diverted the power of Midley&#39;s three special moves and spread them over the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a devilish act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It was a tyranny that took lives of both friend and foe alike.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.1ksv4uv"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Chi!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley glances up at the heavens in panic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Everybody, prepare for impact!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta, being Gobta, warns his friends of the danger via &#39;Telepathy Net&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera calmly slashes at Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He intends to kill Peliod in close combat, since he cannot use magic or emission techniques.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod frowns at this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a matter of fact, there is not that much difference between Obera and Peliod in their overall combat abilities. Peliod&#39;s &#39;Spatial Domination&#39; gives him an absolute advantage over mid- to long-range fighters, but he is not that good in close combat, as evidenced by his failure to finish off Esprit and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan was to gain a psychological advantage over Obera and overwhelm him. Yet, Obera was not afraid of having his special attack broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera was also a fierce fighter who had experienced fighting against cryptids. Having suffered from troublesome opponents with various characteristics, she was not fazed by a few things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Obera&#39;s attitude was a miscalculation, Peliod&#39;s advantage remained the same. By sprinkling death on the battlefield, all the energy of the battlefield becomes Peliod&#39;s power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;But, isn&#39;t it strange? I was able to recover the power of my children, but not the rest...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod looked around the battlefield with this question in his mind, and then he realized that he had made a second miscalculation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy force, that is, Milim&#39;s army, was protected by Geld and his men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t give up. As long as we are here, no one will be killed!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld&#39;s strong and reliable voice echoed across the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ow!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The legionnaires led by Geld are also pushing themselves to meet the legionnaire&#39;s expectations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if their shields are shattered and their armor is lost. Their strong bodies were filled with strength to protect the others from the falling meteors.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill003.jpg" src="images/image17.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s not all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demons under Carrera&#39;s command were also active.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Restoration magic flew over the battlefield, healing the wounded soldiers. And then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, hey, you&#39;ve got a lot more work to do!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one of the devil chevalier, with such a lighthearted remark, exercised the god&#39;s miracle: Resurrection. By believing in Rimuru, they had even learned to resurrect the dead. Even if their bodies were shattered, their souls would be retrieved by the demons and resurrected at a later date.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The morale of Milim&#39;s army remained high because even the dead could come back to life, albeit with a time limit. Everyone was facing this challenge head-on in order to accomplish the mission with all their might.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod was the first one to become upset when he realized this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The dead are coming back to life? There is even such a secret technique in this world...&quot; Peliod muttered in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera explains to Peliod, cowering her shoulders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera explains with a cowering shoulder. It was supposed to be forbidden, but it was so widespread that it was irreversible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Obera was also astonished when she found out about this. I was told this story in the strategy meeting, and I wanted to look up to the heavens and say, &quot;No way!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it is too late now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since this secret technique has already spread so widely that it cannot be recovered, it would be more constructive to make effective use of it. Obera decided that it would be the right thing to accept it, since it would reduce the rate of loss on the battlefield to as close to zero as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, Obera also predicted this situation to some extent. They did not expect that their own techniques would be repelled, but the damage was only done by the enemy&#39;s bugs. It was unfortunate that the energy was concentrated on Peliod, but considering that Peliod was the only enemy left, the situation did not seem that bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Now, you must be prepared. From now on, it&#39;s time for a one-sided hunt.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hunting down and killing prey is Obera&#39;s specialty. Obera&#39;s face is even beginning to show a smile, as he has always been leading a group battle with a superior opponent in mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are your instructions, Master Strategist?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley was also relieved that the damage to the battlefield was minimal. He had not expected destruction on that scale, but he was happy to see that Geld and his team had escaped the disaster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his fears over, he gladly joined Obera&#39;s command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t have any objection either!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta was on board.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Against a strong opponent like Peliod, they would have no chance to win if they did not cooperate with each other. It was difficult for them to get along with each other on the spur of the moment without any training, so they decided to join Obera&#39;s command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Obera, Midley, Gobta &amp; Ranga, and Peliod were pitted against each other. However, another intruder appeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Mother. Grant me the honor of crushing your enemies!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika, who had left Geld behind, dug her way through the ground and jumped out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The score is now three against two, but the numbers can change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t forget about me too!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Me too. I hope you don&#39;t think that was the end of it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion and Frey, healed by Geld who had arrived on the scene, stand up, though still wounded to the bone. Their wounds are visibly healed, but they have not regained their lost strength. They could not perform any major moves when they were out of gas, but they were determined to do more than nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m here too! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld is also in high spirits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The score was now six to two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobua and the Beastketeers are on the battlefield, dealing with the remnants of the bugs. Either way, Peliod is not a force to be reckoned with, so it seems safe to assume that those who have gathered here are the total force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even in front of the assembled warriors, Peliod smiles bewitchingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s a wonderful body. Yes, it is. We will use you to create stronger children. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This confident statement in front of Obera and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And on that basis...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Restorative life.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod was able to use his stored energy to strengthen the children he had created.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This, of course, only applies to those who are still alive. However, Zess and Mujika were still alive and well on this battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here and now, with two super warriors as her escorts, the queen, the wife of Insect Lord Zelanus, has revealed her true nature.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, who understood the situation when Zess pointed out the situation to her, wore a bitter expression on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had been enjoying her battle with Zess, but now she felt drained and disillusioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately after that, he felt a chill and jumped back as fast as he could.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A moment later, the place where I used to be exploded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hm, that&#39;s great. Thanks to you, I am one step closer to becoming a new god of creation. To test this power, you will be of use to me.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess, speaking more fluently than before, opens and closes his fist as he addresses Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the words of the strong to the weak, and a statement that tramples on Carrera&#39;s pride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Heh, heh...you say that. You&#39;re asking me to test your strength against me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I won&#39;t give you any right of refusal.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as he said that, Zess lightly thrust out his fist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a gentle jab, but its speed was tens of times faster than the speed of sound. The shockwave was so strong that it burned the air and shattered the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clearly, it was more powerful than before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The existence value of Zess seems to have increased significantly, if not doubled. What was more troubling was that various special abilities seemed to have been newly added to Zess&#39; being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s not fair at all, Carrera complained inwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all these efforts to build a path to victory, they had to start all over again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, although it is difficult, it is not impossible. Because, even though the strength increased, the level of skill itself did not seem to change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Zess had shown the same level of skill as Zegion, Carrera would have felt threatened. However, since this was not the case, Carrera did not lose his composure despite his frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, she is still annoyed at Zess&#39;s licking attitude, and she is determined to get back at Zess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why Carrera&#39;s smile disappeared from his face is not because he despairs of Zess&#39;s power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem was the situation of his friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;This guy looks pretty bad. He seems stronger than my prey (Zess), and I doubt if Obera and Midley-san can win even if they work together...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s estimation is that Gobta &amp; Ranga, Geld, and Karion &amp; Frey will be able to defeat Mujika by a combined effort. The enhanced Mujika had become such a formidable opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the game played out as Carrera expected, the odds were 50-50.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Sacrifices would be made against milord&#39;s will.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera was faithful to Rimuru&#39;s orders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why she was fighting against Zess was because she thought that she could avoid casualties among her comrades by taking on the most troublesome enemy herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was based on the assumption that Milim would take care of Zelanus, the generals of the enemy, because he thought that once he took care of the second most troublesome enemy, the rest would be taken care of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since they were wrong, they could not afford to be bothered with Zess, which was only the third best player. Carrera had a big decision to make.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I wanted to save some for later, but I don&#39;t want to regret not offering it. Sorry Zess, I would have enjoyed fighting with you more, but I guess it&#39;s time to say goodbye.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera apologized to Zess in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera wanted to gain experience by defeating Zess, but when her friends&#39; lives were at stake, she could not allow herself to put her own pleasure first. She made up her mind and pointed her Golden Gun at Zess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph, don&#39;t you understand yet that such a thing will not work?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Zess said, even Carrera&#39;s mana bullet condensed by the Golden Gun could only produce enough power to damage Zess&#39;s exoskeleton. Moreover, the wound would be regenerated immediately, so the damage was practically zero.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, Carrera continued to use the Golden Gun as a distraction. And there was another reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is more important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then die.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-It was to use it as a trump card in a critical moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Carrera&#39;s words can reach him, the Golden Gun releases the killing bullet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The name of the bullet, which could destroy anyone, was called Judgment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ha?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess looks at the big hole in his chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A feeling of life fading away. The magical core that sustained his existence is destroyed, and he realizes that there is no escape from his impending death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You... have you been cutting corners from the very beginning?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, we were almost even in strength, and you&#39;re pretty good now. If we had gone head-to-head it would have been difficult to win. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was fun to continue fighting a battle that may or may not be won, but this was no longer the time to let Carrera&#39;s personal feelings take precedence. The more Carrera struggled, the higher the probability that all his friends would be wiped out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to that, there was another thing that he really wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The battle with you was interesting in its own way, but you are weaker than Zegion, so I think I&#39;m done with you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a big smile on his face, Carrera told Zess the truth, a truth that would have been hopeless for Zess. It was a very devilish act, but Carrera did it without realizing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am... inferior...? I should be the new god of creation...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess muttered regretfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those were Zess&#39;s last words.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.44sinio"></a><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even in the face of the end of a powerful enemy, Carrera does not feel a sense of accomplishment. Before she can even feel the aftermath of the battle, she is about to go to the aid of Gobta and his men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But just then, the enemy, who had been hiding in plain sight, finally makes his move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph. I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, who had not felt any sign of the enemy, is startled by the pain in his arms. It is not a pain, but a sign of damage. The impact was incredibly heavy and violent, hitting her over the defenses of her arms, which barely protected her vital points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The attack was a kick from Insect Lord Zelanus, who appeared to have surpassed even Carrera&#39;s &#39;Universal Perception&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera reacts quickly, but anyone else would have been finished off by the blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kuk, you&#39;re in a hurry to get here at last, aren&#39;t you? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If I can hit an enemy, I will crush him without hesitation.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Insect Lord Zelanus was looking for an opportunity to strike Carrera just as he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was confident of his overwhelming superiority, but still, fearing the possibility of a defeat, he kept his eyes vigilantly on Carrera until the time of his victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Carrera&#39;s &quot;Judgment&quot; that he had been on the lookout for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Minaza, who had sent him as a sentinel, had reported about a man named Kondou. Although Kondou had not revealed all of his powers, Minaza, who had been observing him, had judged that he was &#39;highly dangerous with unknown powers&#39; and Zelanus had taken this seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus, who remembered this, had also inquired Michael and Feldway, and knew that Kondou&#39;s authority had been transferred to Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had made some predictions for the current operation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Michael&#39;s case, &quot;Castle Guard&quot; seems to have prevented the attack, but Zelanus has no such authority. He was waiting for Carrera to use her nasty power, because he was afraid that his own defense would not be enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This timidity and cautiousness are the factors that make Zelanus the strongest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now, after waiting for a long time, my worries are finally gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We lost an important piece, Zess, but on the other hand, it was a good thing that we were so cautious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It was a great power, even for an enemy. If I had been hit by this, I would not have survived.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) While praising it, Zelanus&#39; worries are already past.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that he has taken all precautions, there is no longer any sense of danger for Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, too, has seen Zelanus and understands the danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;This guy is dangerous. I don&#39;t understand...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was as if we were facing Zegion, or even worse. Zelanus has no chance, and I feel like I don&#39;t even have a clue how to get to the bottom of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had to admit, though uncomfortably so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Insect Lord Zelanus is stronger than Carrera, the &quot;Menace Lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that does not mean Carrera will give up so easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? You call yourself a king, aren&#39;t you a little bit impatient?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera says hatefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Zelanus was better than Carrera in their quarrel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph, you&#39;re so bossy at this stage of the game, the devil is a man who hates to lose. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked down on Carrera with the air of a victor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Perhaps you think you&#39;ve already won, don&#39;t you? That&#39;s a little too arrogant in front of me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s expression did not show any room for complacency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, Carrera&#39;s arms had been shattered by Zelanus&#39; mere kick. It was difficult for Carrera to even hold the Golden Gun, let alone grasp the sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s skeleton was originally made of Rimuru&#39;s special orichalcum. It had now evolved into a hihiirokane. It has strength, hardness, and viscosity equivalent to those of mythical-grade, and has indestructible properties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be understandable if he had been injured by a mythical-grade weapon, but it was unexpected that a mere kick could cause this much damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That alone makes us understand the threat level of Insect Lord Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The secret of this threat was revealed when we looked at the whole body of Insect Lord Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its exoskeleton was shining in rainbow colors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was just like the glow of hihiirokane.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I never thought that the whole body was a hihiirokane...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking at his body, it was obvious that Insect Lord Zelanus is the ultimate life form that combines offense and defense. His whole body was a deadly weapon and the strongest shield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slowly, Carrera observed the whole of Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The silvery cilia running from his forehead to his back looked like long hair. However, upon closer inspection, each hair was covered with tiny protuberances that resembled the shape of a blade. Even the cilia were probably made by hihiirokane, since they appeared to be rainbow-colored when viewed from different angles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Does it mean that each of those hairs is a mythical-grade blade? I don&#39;t know how to manipulate them, but they might cut us into tiny pieces if we are not careful...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On his forehead, a pair of antennae were swinging. Two pairs of wings from its back and waist were glowing red, and three pairs of arms were poised on the defensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Those wings also look dangerous. They are terribly dense, but is it because of the energy compression? If they are released, they might change the shape of the star by themselves...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Probably, it will be more destructive than the extreme magic that Carrera manipulates. That&#39;s how much I could feel the frightening energy from those two pairs of wings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the three pairs of arms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One pair of arms was randomly arranged, but the other two pairs were ready for battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lowest arm, crossed in front of the abdomen, was ready to cast a spell at any moment. In addition, the arm in the upper stance was discolored and deformed from the middle, becoming thin like a blade and shining dully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the first blow had been made with those thin arms, it was highly probable that Carrera&#39;s arms would have been amputated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Carrera continued to observe, Zelanus placed one foot on the prone Zess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It looked like he was stomping on his son, but the reality was worse than that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you doing?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera asked, and was answered by the sound of gurgling, grinding, and chewing coming from under Zelanus&#39; feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, that&#39;s right. Zelanus was eating Zess, his son and head of the Insect General, in front of Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You know, that guy was bragging about being the next God of Creation...were you planning on using him as a pawn from the start?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera asks with narrowed eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The answer was a loud laugh from Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Stop laughing. The successor of Walle must be the strongest. Even more so than he was. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A weaker man than I am cannot be the god of creation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Zelanus moves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a mouth that appears on the sole of his foot, he finishes eating Zess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He absorbs knowledge and experience in order to take his power for himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a proof of this, Zelanus&#39; tone has become fluent without an accent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his power...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera tries desperately to take a defensive position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But her hand does not move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Oh no ! If she takes it seriously, she will be damaged beyond recovery ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) His thoughts accelerate a million times and he comes to a conclusion, but the reality is merciless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least, not in Carrera&#39;s life so far. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But apparently, this moment is different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus&#39; kick was caught by someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wa-ha-ha-ha! Now is the time for me. I&#39;m not going to hold back anymore!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The girl appeared with her platinum pink hair, smiling happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that girl is Carrera&#39;s new friend and one of the strongest in the world - Demon Lord Milim Nava.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Carrera, I&#39;m going to take her!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and Milim and Zelanus went into full-on battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, Carrera had no more chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I can&#39;t help it. I&#39;ll recover as soon as possible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera changed her mind quickly and calmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While recovering herself, she turned her attention to the battle situation of Obera&#39;s group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle was more fierce than he had expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Carrera&#39;s defeat of Zess, only Peliod and Mujika remain as Insect General. However, these two are very troublesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most notable one is Peliod. The wife of Insect Lord Zelanus and the creator of all the insects, she seemed to be getting more and more powerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To fight against Peliod, five members led by Obera, excluding Midley, were fighting against her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera was leading and acting as a wall. As soon as she was exhausted, Geld would step forward and take her place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The remaining three, Karion, Frey, Gobta, and Ranga, were playing a ranger role and repeatedly attacking Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was, in Carrera&#39;s opinion, a very dangerous strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Karion and Frey, who were exhausted, even though they were of an awakened class, even a single blow from Peliod could be fatal. Even though Obera and Geld were distracting them, one wrong move could have resulted in a catastrophe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why the roles of Obera and Geld are important here. Especially now that there is no healer, this war is not possible without Geld, who has a high self-regeneration ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley is playing against Mujika instead of Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a one-on-one battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika, who has greatly increased her power, is much stronger than Midley in terms of existence value alone. However, the battle was still close, almost back-and-forth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason for this is the seriousness of Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley, not in a mood to be shy of showing off his skills, had lifted all the restrictions he had imposed on himself and showed his &#39;dragon body&#39; which he had never shown except when he was fighting against Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her limbs are covered with dragon scales while she still retains her human form. The whole body under the clothes was similarly protected except for the joints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, this is not to say that the existence value is increased by this, but only that the dragon is fully exercising its power. In other words, Midley is now in a state where all restraints have been suspended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the reason why this was a heated battle, with both sides exploring each other&#39;s abilities, and even engaging in a high level of psychological warfare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wow, Midley-san is the best. I was curious to see who is better than Zegion, but I guess it&#39;s a close match!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, who was watching the game, was so impressed by Midley&#39;s strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika, who is a warrior by nature, has a certain level of skill. Otherwise, he would have been defeated by Geld long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika&#39;s existence value has increased several times compared to Geld&#39;s even before the enhancement. Even when compared to Midley, Mujika&#39;s value was more than three times higher than Midley&#39;s, and there was an overwhelming gap between the two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he was able to compete with such Mujika, it was easy to understand how insane Midley was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Zegion would win in a serious fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, if Zegion fights with the same force as Midley... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Carrera&#39;s opinion, the skill level of both fighters seemed to be equal.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a fierce battle, Midley and Mujika faced each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were looking for each other&#39;s opening and were unable to attack each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Mujika opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are a good player. Shall I ask your name? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Midley. Shall I ask your name too? If it&#39;s the name of a man so fierce that he amuses me so much, it&#39;s worth remembering. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite being enemies, Midley and Mujika recognize each other. Mujika, in particular, seems to have become more human after the &#39;wrist-life&#39;, and her skills have become less mechanical and more brilliant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley may have sensed this change, and he truly approves of Mujika. Otherwise, he would not have exposed his full strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is a battlefield, and both men are enemies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They recognize each other, but what they are doing is killing each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley laughed and brought out his left fist in a fluid motion. He pulled back his left fist faster than the speed at which he thrust it, and used the recoil to throw a spinning kick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a so-called feint, but in Midley&#39;s case, it is not the only one. When he clenched his fist for the first time, he compressed the air and shot out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, since he mixed the air with fighting spirit, the power of his fists was more powerful than that of a mana bullet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika had her sword ready in response to the fist, so she was able to repel the compressed air bullet. However, right after that, Midley&#39;s kick cleanly entered the gap left by Mujika&#39;s lifting his sword to the upper level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gnuh!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The force of the kick, which penetrates under the armor, runs through Mujika&#39;s entire body and affects her physical functions. Needless to say, Midley&#39;s kicks were full of fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley was a master of &quot;battlewill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as the &quot;Ryuken&quot; school had sprouted in the other world where Velgrynd had arrived, here in the Cardinal World, a unique school had been introduced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This school, which uses basic movements similar to those of koryu jujutsu and manipulates the body by incorporating its own fighting spirit, also expressed the unrestrained spirit of Milim, the founder of the school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no name of the school, but if we were to naming it, it would be &quot;Ryu-Ma-Ken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, there is no ritual of inheriting &quot;konpaku&quot; (soul) as in Dragon Fist. The knowledge and experience accumulated by a person are all that he or she has acquired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lifespan of a person in the Cardinal World varies widely, and is greatly extended by the way he or she lives. Training and physical conditioning through Battlewill alone can increase a person&#39;s life expectancy by several times, and a pureblood like Midley can live for more than a thousand years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Midley was over 2,000 years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley was strong because he had spent all that time in training.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika was hit by Midley&#39;s kick and took a step backward. Then she glanced at the hit area and was astonished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her shell armor, which had not suffered even a scratch from a half-hearted attack, was crushed with a big dent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lower-ranked soldiers of insectar have no fear, so they repeatedly attacked by suicide attack as they were ordered, no matter how superior they are. However, the higher ranks, due to their rarity, were able to instinctively grasp the difference in power between them and their opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The accuracy of the Insect General is quite high, and it can almost accurately estimate their fighting ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this is limited only to the direct ability, so it cannot detect the authority of Skill. And, of course, you cannot know how much the target has been trained without actually fighting with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika was now on the maximum alert against Midley because of the blow he had just received. Although he had been empowered by Peliod, he calmly judged that he might lose if the game was prolonged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the only thing he could do was to show his respect to his opponent with his best technique with all his strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Taste my technique - eat my fangs.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika&#39;s weapon is not strictly speaking a sword. It is an alienium forged into a blade. Now, as Mujika has evolved, it has become sharper and sharper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Furthermore, Mujika&#39;s mana was poured into the blade, which was comparable to a mythical-grade blade, and it became so powerful that it could cut off any substance, and approached Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Midley was unmoved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He raised his left hand with a &quot;Nun ! and caught Mujika&#39;s blade with his left arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, he caught it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A hard, unpleasant sound rang out, deafening. It was the melody of a shockwave created by the collision of equal power and hardness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nonsense... ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why are you surprised? If you had the spirit, it would be easy to use your own body as a weapon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika&#39;s response is the correct one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Midley was a man who was always trained to deal with the unreasonableness of Milim. He had no idea that his logic was insane to ordinary people, and he never doubted that it was normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, he does not manage to do so only by his willpower.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a certain skill, covered by dragon scales, for one thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley controls his own fighting spirit and hardens his body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He anticipates where the attack will come and focuses his attention on that part of the body. He concentrated all his fighting energy on that part of his body, even though it might lower the defenses of other parts of his body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This has given his left arm enough defensive power to withstand mythical-grade power, and it would be quite reckless to call it a mere &quot;Kiai&quot; (spirit).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is only possible because of Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Midley&#39;s true nature is in the position of &quot;Ryujin&quot;, which Gabil will reach someday, and with his divine physical strength, he can fight against mythical-grade fighters with his guts called &quot;Kiai&quot;.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.2jxsxqh"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course, the technology was not limited to defense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Now it&#39;s my turn.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley grinned as he sat back down, his left hand still on the blade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the shiko-uchi stance in karate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He then diverts the enormous energy generated in his left arm and concentrates it in his right fist. Furthermore, he took in the energy of the earth&#39;s veins flowing through this star from his feet, which were in contact with the earth, and not only that, he stored the energy of the star itself in his body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the essence of &#39;Seishin Douka&#39; or &#39;Dragon Magic Fist&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, the physical burden was unimaginable, but Midley was able to overcome it with his spirit. He did not think about what would happen next, but only about winning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nuh!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time Mujika sensed the danger, it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dragonic Blast!&quot;Dragonic blast! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was Midley&#39;s ultimate technique, the strongest technique that even surpassed the Dragon Fang Canon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first glance, it was just a straight fist thrust, exactly the same as the one that had smashed Insect General Saril&#39;s body to pieces, but its power was beyond the laws and common sense of this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the same for Mujika - she finally understood Midley&#39;s abnormality after he made a big hole in the center of her chest, but it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Is it not enough just to be cautious... I&#39;m getting old as a geezer myself...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika thinks with her last thought. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for some reason, the defeat was pleasant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mujika died satisfied not as an Insect General but as a warrior.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re good, Midley-san-, Carrera&#39;s eyes widened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a likeable man, but his strength was admirable even in Carrera&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just watching this awakened master class in his advanced offense and defense, Carrera felt as if he had gained a great deal of experience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For now, however, the priority was to deal with the remaining problem of Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that Midley had defeated Mujika, they were ready to launch an all-out battle. It would be nice if Carrera could join them, but he was not ready to move yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus&#39; blow was that deadly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, feeling frustrated at her own inadequacy, calmly analyzes the situation of the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Good grief, bugs are really troublesome...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was his true feeling and conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just now, Peliod&#39;s power has increased further. It was good that I had defeated Mujika, but Peliod had been strengthened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason is that it has taken Mujika&#39;s power as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of Zess was directly taken by Zelanus. Therefore, there was no reduction to Peliod. However, if Mujika dies on this battlefield, as Mujika did, all her power is absorbed into Peliod. And by using it, Peliod can restructure its own body as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the tricky thing about Peliod&#39;s power that dominates this battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod&#39;s whole body is covered with warrior-like armor, and his hand holds a sword. Having taken Mujika&#39;s characteristics and experience into his own hands, Peliod now seemed to be able to fight in melee combat as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(It seems that his weaknesses are disappearing more and more. (I&#39;m so glad that milord&#39;s policy of no casualties is working when it comes to taking away the power of the fallen on this battlefield.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of those who died on this battlefield, friend or foe, will flow to Peliod. The only way to break such a condition is to &#39;destroy&#39; the boundary that covers this battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that is impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because not only Insect Lord Zelanus, the leader of the enemy, but also Demon Lord Milim are making efforts to maintain the wards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Otherwise, this planet itself would have disappeared long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus&#39; goal was to dominate the planet, not to destroy it, which is the only reason why the two camps agreed on this point and the environmental protection by the &#39;Barrier&#39; was naturally maintained. As a result, however, Peliod&#39;s domination was completed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a very troublesome story, but it is too late to realize it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well, it seems that there will be no further enhancement...or will there? Don&#39;t be in a hurry. We&#39;ll just have to find a way to get around it somehow.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are no insectar survivors except the Emperor and the Queen. Unless there are casualties from the allied camps, it is safe to assume that there will be no further reinforcement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course, Obera and Midley correctly understood the current situation, as Carrera realized. Therefore, they could not take any reckless suicide attacks or self-sacrificing tactics, and the only course of action was to continue the endurance warfare, which was a passive but steady approach to inflicting damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, since this has been the strategy from the beginning, no one has been in a hurry or mentally overawed. Even though Peliod was reinforced, the strategy remained the same, and they maintained the strategy centering on Obera and Geld, steadily waiting for Peliod to get exhausted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(That&#39;s great...but...). But...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though a strong player named Midley had joined the war, the situation was not getting better, but rather, the situation was getting worse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera was in danger of losing the war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle between Milim and Zelanus was on a different level and had been lost in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What he needed to think about now was how to attack Peliod before any of his friends would be killed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was nothing decisive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a miracle that the battle was in balance, and such a tightrope situation could not last for long. Even a single mistake would lead to the defeat of the war like an ant breaking through a dike.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before that happens, we must do something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s expression turns angry again and he glares at his right arm, which does not seem to be moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he does not move now, he will have no reason to be here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, this is a big problem that affects the reason for Carrera&#39;s existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the reason why she asked for strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, the Golden Gun glowed faintly.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I will lend you my strength. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera heard an inaudible voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera is startled for the first time in a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the next moment...</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle was the return of a myth.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim and Zelanus, their fists cut the sky, the atmosphere vibrated, and the earth shook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was so intense that it could have shattered even the stars, but it didn&#39;t for one reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus and Milim had protected this battlefield with their &#39;Defense Barrier&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is also the reason why Milim did not join the war from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had assessed the effects of Carrera&#39;s Abyss Annihilation and calculated the damage that this war would cause to the earth. Based on this, they were working to protect the planet itself with the Barrier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim is a tyrant, but he is also a thoughtful man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says and does what he means, but behind the scenes, he knows exactly what the consequences of his actions will be. It is Milim Nava, the demon lord, who manages to have both sides of the coin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, Milim has handed over the role of rampaging to Carrera, but he soon realized that there is someone else who is trying to protect this planet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is, of course, the leader of the enemy, Insect Lord Zelanus himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Hmm. He seems to be thinking the same thing as I am. This is a little troublesome...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus&#39; action was unexpected even for Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is natural that he would try to protect this planet since he is the one who is trying to invade our world. However, Milim was not so easily convinced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it was just a &#39;Barrier&#39;, it would have been fine, but it had been given an effect that was convenient for the enemy. I wanted to destroy it, but that would have affected my own &#39;Barrier&#39; and might have caused serious damage to this planet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(No, you have the nerve to use my &#39;Barrier&#39; ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Despite such frustration, they were unable to make any rash moves. This situation was the proof that the leader of the enemy was capable, so they could not lose their temper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Milim, who could solve most of the problems by violence, had to act cautiously in the face of an enemy who might be his equal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Patiently waiting for the right moment, he finally made his move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim tried to make a move immediately, but there was a problem. Zelanus had carefully set up the &#39;Barrier&#39; so that Milim could not break into it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it took less than ten seconds to disarm it, the delay was a blunder that could have been fatal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, the effect was only a little harassment, but it did not change the fact that he had been outmaneuvered. Milim regretted it but praised it honestly and calmly vowed to get back at Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was only because he had arrived just in time for Carrera&#39;s crisis. Carrera would not have died, but if it had been fatal, it is unclear what would have happened to Milim&#39;s anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would have been a relief to the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At any rate, the worst was over for Milim, and all that remained was to defeat Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He joined the war happily and started to fight against Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus was strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He took Milim&#39;s fist without hesitation and hit back sharply. Milim also took it in his stride, and he hit Milim with kicks, elbows, and head-butts in a flowing motion. Zelanus, too, did not lag behind Milim, but responded to him in an impressive manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both fighters fought fiercely, using only their bodies as weapons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re good, aren&#39;t you? I didn&#39;t expect you to play with me this much!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Haha, no kidding. I was a bit wary of how good she would be since she is the daughter of the Creator, but I guess it&#39;s not that big a deal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus responded to Milim&#39;s flippant words with a pompous attitude, but in fact, he was not letting his guard down. Inwardly, he is just playing the role of a condescending person with the utmost caution toward Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus was cautious, as evidenced by the fact that he was wary of Carrera&#39;s &quot;Judgment&quot;. Pride has nothing to do with Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he was an absolute strong man, he was never overconfident. The essence of Zelanus was to give his all without letting his guard down, no matter who his opponent was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For this reason, Zelanus does not limit his vigilance to Milim alone. It is the essence of Zelanus to always do his best, not only against strong enemies but also against weak ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, he set up the &#39;Barrier&#39; to delay Milim&#39;s entry into the game. In that instant, he was going to take out Carrera and take its power for himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This did not happen because Milim&#39;s computing power was superior to Zelanus&#39; expectation and Carrera was more stubborn than he had imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Zelanus, the failure to finish off Carrera was also a blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Carrera recovered and joined hands with Milim, it would be a problem. In addition, if they were forced into an endurance war, they might use &quot;Judgment&quot; again, which was limited to once a day. If we judge such a situation calmly, we cannot be optimistic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Zelanus used a sophisticated tactic in his conversation with Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(It would be a good thing if he could let his guard down, but I wonder how good the daughter of the Creator really is.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus is thinking about this, and is waiting to see what Milim will do. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim, on the other hand, smiles with a big smile on his face in an arrogant manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ha-ha-ha! You say that, don&#39;t you? Then you better entertain me!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim is now in his true form for the first time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beautiful crimson horns sprout from her forehead, parting her beautiful platinum pink hair. On his back, he spreads his dragon wings and wears jet-black armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In his hand, he holds Asura, which was given to him by Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is rare for Milim to use a weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whatever he may say, he admires Zelanus that much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus also realized that his performance was not working for Milim. If so, there is no point in making up for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If you are so strong, why are you so cautious? Are you a coward?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim asks curiously, to which Zelanus answers without concealment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, what is cowardice? If I would rather be defeated without fear of my enemies, I would rather be the victor even if I am a coward. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without losing his kingly bearing, he assures us that he has nothing to be ashamed of. This is Zelanus&#39; true intention, and he is proud of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;A victor? What do you want?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I know. My mission is to surpass the Creator. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was Zelanus&#39; true intention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Zelanus has been thinking about the reason for his existence ever since he was Named by Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not blinded by respect for the Creator as Feldway was, but he had always been trying to figure out what he should do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The answer he came up with was - &quot;to surpass the Parent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus&#39; body is immortal. Every cell in his body is controlled by his mind and can be reproduced instantly, not just regenerated. Zelanus was not affected by disease or injury, and his existence transcended his own lifespan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, they die when their energy is depleted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though the body is immortal, the mind has a limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, he was not immortal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus must one day surpass Veldanava. Since he cannot resist &quot;death&quot; in his present state, he is determined to improve himself by all possible means, timidly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why we must increase the number of our subordinates without completing the task by ourselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At great risk, he created Peliod to be his spouse. He created children with her to be his hands and feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The children, like their parent Zelanus, sought strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zess was especially like her, and like Zelanus, she was very cowardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was also mean and cunning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She saw in her newborn &quot;brother&quot; a potential threat to herself, and tried to nip it in the bud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the point that it would eat the individual who had been born as the next generation&#39;s queen and take its power for its own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The attempts seem to have failed, but all of this is none of Zelanus&#39; concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He let them do what they wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Zess would then become the next god of creation, that would be a joyous occasion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Either he, the parent, or Zess, the son, would be justified, and the next century would be built by the winner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus, however, had no intention of giving up his throne, and he would take Zess&#39;s power when she grew up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus always knew exactly what Zess&#39;s power was by loving her and gaining her trust to ensure his victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, the presence of Carrera, a dangerous element, made it possible for him to make good use of Zess as a touchstone. Zelanus was satisfied with the result because he was able to take away Zess&#39;s power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as someone as strong as Zelanus was so cunning and cautious, it was as good as impregnable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Zelanus responded to Milim without any shame.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim realized that Zelanus was more dangerous than he had expected. He thought that if Zelanus was not defeated at this point, it would be an unmanageable disaster, and he decided that he should do everything in his power to eliminate him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would have liked to play with you more, but unfortunately you are dangerous. I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m going to take you seriously from now on.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim becomes serious and declares this to Zelanus. Then he releases his power without a word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus could not afford to lose any more time. He had no choice but to get serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;LOL. I&#39;ll deal with you as a diversion before we challenge the summit. Let me show you the power of the Creator&#39;s daughter!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stops worrying about her impact on the world and unleashes her accumulated, terrible power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The atmosphere trembled as their power increased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as there is no significant gap in their skills (level), the battle will only be prolonged by the grinding of combat. This is a common understanding, and that is why Milim has chosen to use special magic for short-term annihilation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In response, Zelanus also improved his fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The clash between Milim&#39;s high energy and Zelanus&#39; fighting energy created compression explosions (plasma) here and there in the space.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The aftermath alone is powerful enough to crush a poor monster into tiny pieces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even a greater majin would not be able to survive if caught in such an explosion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No third party is allowed to enter the battlefield where such a tremendous explosion is flying wildly. They had already evacuated long ago and were watching the situation from a distance outside the &quot;Barrier&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we had been a little late in escaping, we would have been in a hellscape by now. But despite the energy force field that has been created, the real work has not yet begun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll show you the best! Drago Nova!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Star particles sparkle between Milim&#39;s hands, swirling into an unworldly force of destruction. He bundles them together and shoots them at Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill004.jpg" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.z337ya"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with the power to twist space like Peliod, it&#39;s impossible to take it all in. Milim, with this in mind, has struck with the power of tyranny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an outrageous act that would have made him a &quot;Destroyer,&quot; and in this case, he was right. In a battle between paranormals, the longer the fight goes on, the more serious the damage will be. Since the &#39;Barrier&#39;, which is a combination of the power of Milim and Zelanus, was present here, Milim used it to the utmost limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Zelanus, like Milim, chose to use the special killing technique to destroy the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Eat up the Devastator Virus!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dark microparticles rose from Zelanus&#39; body. They blocked Drago Nova&#39;s brilliance as if he were a willful being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the dark cells that make up Zelanus&#39; body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus, who can manipulate the matter he takes in from the other world at will, is able to make his own body microscopic and invade the enemy&#39;s body. The tiny, willful cells break through even the &#39;Barrier&#39; and devour the target from the inside, making it impossible for ordinary people to even resist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The shimmering light emitted by Milim intersects with the dark particles controlled by Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the light drove out the darkness, the darkness swallowed the light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a moment in time, but it is a moment so tense that it seems infinite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an unfavorable situation for both parties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim was going to win overwhelmingly, and Zelanus was going to eat Milim with Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, the outcome of the game was revealed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When light and darkness converged, there stood Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dark microparticles had clung to Milim&#39;s body, but they had been extinguished by Milim&#39;s haki. Milim, though fatigued, was unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Zelanus?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is this pain? I didn&#39;t think there was anything I couldn&#39;t eat...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazingly, he survived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s Drago Nova is composed mainly of a special substance called star particles. It is a substance with destructive power that only Milim can control, even more than a reiko, and unless its properties can be analyzed, it is uncontrollable by any human being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only natural that Zelanus failed in his attempt to eat it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Zelanus succeeded in killing it, but not in eating it. Although some damage was sustained, it was at a sufficiently regenerative level that it had no effect on the continuation of the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim suffered from mental exhaustion and Zelanus from some physical wear and tear. That was the only result of the exchange of fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus stood up quickly and stared at Milim with his compound eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Can I really win this battle?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim is strong because she is the daughter of the Creator. It was said that she had inherited most of the power of the Creator, but it seemed that she still had more power than she had ever known.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus was convinced of this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus was convinced of this because he had seen the &quot;barren land&quot; where he had once fought a mortal battle with the Demon Lord Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As is typical of the cautious Zelanus, he is well informed. The land, also called the Deadly Desert, was created more than 2,000 years ago, yet it is still contaminated by a dense magicule.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of Milim&#39;s Drago Nova is great, but it is not contaminated to that extent. Therefore, we should think that there is something else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The uncertainty of what it was made Zelanus uneasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Zelanus, victory at all costs is not what he wants. He must win, safely and surely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus&#39; belief was absolute, and based on that belief, further battles were dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no such thing as a &quot;just in case&quot; and Milim was still an unknown... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus was considering retreat at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shortly after this, an event occurred that forced Zelanus to make a decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera heard the voice of someone who was not supposed to be here, and realized that it was no longer the time to be a spectator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a bit of a surprise, but Carrera was not so naive as to doubt the reality of the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, did you miss your death?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I was summoned from the other world because you are not worthy.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one who smiles grimly is Lieutenant Kondou, who was supposed to have died by Carrera&#39;s hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown to Carrera, Masayuki&#39;s Ultimate Skill &#39;King of Heroes&#39; had been activated just before this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Kondou here is an entity, but not a living one, an &quot;Einherjar,&quot; an entity that is as real as the Digital Lifeform, but not the real thing. It would have been impossible, but through Masayuki&#39;s authority, he rushed to Carrera&#39;s perilous situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well. The devil who killed me, don&#39;t tell me this is the end of it? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m thinking. I was about to beat him to a pulp, but you interrupted me.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kondou doesn&#39;t ask &quot;How?&quot; He does not ask back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nods his head, smiling wryly, and says, &quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; and tells them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will help you, too, but you must forgive me.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a very natural offer of cooperation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera accepted it as a matter of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, what?

Despite this understanding, Peliod is unable to suppress his frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the majin named Geld was particularly displeasing to Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he was not as strong as the current Peliod, he was extremely persistent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He should have died long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He kept getting back up again and again, even though I had hit him directly many times with attacks that were intended to kill him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, his eyes were also hateful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he should have clearly understood the difference in power, he was staring at Peliod as if he would never give up. It was as if he was sure of his victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. That&#39;s the look I should be giving you!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera is still understandable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had sent scouts to investigate cryptid, and of course they had been informed of Obera&#39;s army as an opposing force. And having seen their strength in this battle, they were aware of the danger they were in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why they exhausted them by firing two big shots at them, and they were not belittling them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, I did not expect that there was an obstacle such as Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;He was only as good as Mujika before his wrist-life, but his durability is extraordinary. I wonder how long she can withstand my attacks...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod keeps his composure while trying his best to calm down his inner frustration. Then, as if to vent his anger, he waved his tentacles and launched a &quot;Midaregiri&quot; attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, most of the slashes are canceled out by Geld&#39;s Chaos Eater. The remaining slashes are also neatly avoided, and Peliod&#39;s anger only grows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is not because Peliod is not strong enough, but because Geld and the others are doing their best with their lives.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta overcomes his fear and devotes himself to disturbing Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trusting Gobta, Ranga cooperated fully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley enjoys the battle, but he knows that if he dies, it will be the end of him. He overcomes his fears and is purely working to kill Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion and Frey were repeatedly attacking Peliod from the air and on land, fully utilizing their awakened power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, their training in the labyrinth of Ramiris had paid off. Without that experience, he would have been forced to leave the front line long ago due to a misdistribution of forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera was Obera, and he read the situation very precisely and gave the right instructions. Geld is safe because she has been changing the role of the shield precisely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld, however, was no longer conscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Peliod had predicted, it was a miracle that he was still alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is standing here with only his spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &#39;full body armor&#39; that had become one with his authority was cracked and shattered, leaving only remnants. And his body has long since exceeded its limits, so battered that even the &#39;Ultraspeed Regeneration&#39; cannot keep up with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why it is still able to fight is because of the secret of Geld&#39;s power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld&#39;s Ultimate Gift &#39;Gourmet King Beelzebub&#39; includes the &#39;Grant Protection&#39; ability, which increases the defense of his comrades, and the &#39;Substitute&#39; ability, which takes the damage taken by others. Grant Protection&#39; which increases the defense of your comrades. Moreover, by combining these two abilities, they have completely different effects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is, it is an effect to make others take the damage you take. Geld was able to distribute his damage to his subordinates while adjusting the amount of damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there is a limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His men claimed to be able to withstand more, but Geld knew this to be a lie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone had reached their limits, just as he had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, Geld stood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked forward and did not look away from Peliod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was following Rimuru&#39;s words that in a fight, the one who looks away loses the fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was like a casual remark at a drinking party, but to Geld, it was a great saying. He believed that even if it was not true, he could change it to the truth by his own power. This was the man Geld was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, even Geld had his limits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under another attack, he finally fell to his knees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I can&#39;t get up...I can&#39;t get up...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ufufufufu, you finally sank. Let&#39;s congratulate you on your good fight, and let&#39;s kill you once and for all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod laughs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is not showing mercy to Geld by putting him off, but is going to give him a good beating later on. It was purely an experiment to see how much of an attack he could withstand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, it was also foolish to be concerned only with Geld at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the others are not as durable as Geld, he decides that he should eliminate the threat as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that the obstacle was gone, victory was assured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only concern is that Zelanus, the leader of Peliod, has entered into battle with the Demon Lord Milim, and the outcome of the battle is uncertain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is as planned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the power of Demon Lord Milim was unknown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod does not doubt Zelanus&#39; victory, but he wants to go to the aid of Zelanus as soon as possible to make sure of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well, now that this stubborn guy is down, the rest of the mooks should go down easily.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod, confident of his victory, is about to launch his special move against Obera and the others, when he suddenly stops.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A chill runs down his spine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He senses someone&#39;s interference in this battlefield, in the space that Peliod controls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;How can this be ? There must be only a few people who can enter here.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even among the strong who have been informed of the situation in advance, it is difficult to enter this controlled space from the outside. Even if they interfered in space-time by offensive operations like Milim, it would take much longer time after the anomaly was sensed in the &#39;Barrier&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, the person appeared in this space as if there were no obstacle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no one who could do such a thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If there is, it would be more than a life form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod locates the coordinates of the person&#39;s appearance and fixes his gaze on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There, he sees a golden glow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The glint was coming from the barrel of a gun, and the muzzle of the gun was pointed at Peliod himself. The one who was holding the gun was Yellow Primordial (Jaune), who had been left alone, thinking that he could no longer do anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The target person was standing close to Yellow Primordial (Carrera), and his eyes were sharply fixed on Peliod&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was clear what he was going to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was a threat that made Peliod shudder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Stop it!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could say a word, a bullet shattered Peliod&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And without fail, it reaped the very existence of its life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Peliod was extinguished before he had time to leave even a few words of resignation.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.3j2qqm3"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus senses that Peliod has disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had disappeared - in other words, he was dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a serious situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s time to go.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus mutters to himself and decides to retreat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim wonders. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I said there is no point in fighting any more.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peliod&#39;s death was unexpected for Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was enough to cause a major disruption in his future plans, and he could no longer be concerned with the immediate victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if he continued to fight Milim, it was 50-50 whether Zelanus would win or not. The reason why Zelanus still decided to fight was that Peliod was planning to kill all the enemy generals, capture their power, and support Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Peliod could restructure himself by integrating the power of the warriors here, he would be reborn as a super-enhanced being, though not as powerful as Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that plan has been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, we find ourselves in a battle that we are not even sure we can win. Zelanus is not optimistic enough to tolerate such uncertainty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, there was a bigger concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battlefield is covered by a complex of &#39;barriers&#39; with the purpose of reducing the damage to the planet. Yet, the overall strength of the Barrier has been weakened by the death of Peliod, who had been a part of the Barrier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as Milim is hiding its strength, Zelanus is not yet ready. The decision to continue the battle was also based on the fear that it might cause unforeseen problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you trying to escape?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zelanus snickered at Milim&#39;s provocation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim is not a fool, and he understands that he will not be able to give his best if the &#39;Barrier&#39; is lost. That is why they set up a short battle, and since they could not win the battle, there is no reason to keep Zelanus in this position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is true that Milim is hiding his power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has not used the power he has in his body, and he even thinks that it would not be difficult for him to win against Zelanus by using it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, what followed was the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once Milim&#39;s power is released, it is difficult to stop it. Once Milim&#39;s power is released, it is difficult to stop it, because once it exceeds the limit, Milim loses its reason and enters into a runaway state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s &#39;stumping,&#39; as Frey once told Clayman, really existed. Milim had told him in a light tone, so Frey did not think it was true, but it was a true story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Milim thinks: &quot;My friends are getting tired and some of them are even in danger if we delay the treatment. It is better to make a fresh start than to forcefully finish him off.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was Milim&#39;s conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Milim decided to let Zelanus go.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera confirms the disappearance of Peliod and smiles happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Fufufu, look at that. We won.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera turned around as if to say so, but Kondou was not there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kondou had not been formally summoned by Masayuki&#39;s authority, but had only forcibly appeared using the Golden Gun that Carrera had given him as a medium. It was such an existence that we could understand if we were told that it was an illusion created by Carrera&#39;s desire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I know. You came here because you were worried about me because I was not good enough, didn&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera said with a smile to the empty sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is sad, but Carrera is strong enough to bear it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why she decided to be stronger so that she would not have to make the same mistake next time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta was raising his battle cry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga was shouting in triumph as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, they are very similar to each other, which makes me smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Geld, exhausted, falls down, and Obera helps him up as if to congratulate him on a good fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion and Frey are nodding to each other, lending a hand to Obera and laughing with Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil and the others rush in to help Geld on a stretcher and sprinkle him with recovery medicine. He seemed to be in good health, despite all the fuss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Geld and the others are carried off to Tempest, Midley murmurs with emotion: &quot;We won.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We won.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, Midley-san. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, Mr. Midley, it&#39;s embarrassing to be addressed by a primordial who&#39;s lived longer than I have. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, that&#39;s all right. I&#39;m a man of respect for those I recognize. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m honored.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conversation stopped there, and for a while the two men basked in the afterglow of their victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With so many wounded, it was hardly a complete victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, no one had died. Carrera was satisfied with that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As far as this battlefield was concerned, she had given strict orders to her demons to recover the souls of the dead, so she was able to cope with this scale of damage. Even so, if we had been hit by a powerful and wide-range attack like Obera&#39;s great destructive technique, the casualties would have been so great that they would have been irreversible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that we were able to rejoice together like this was a great victory for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will be stronger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm. The legendary demons I had been told about were more like monsters that didn&#39;t understand the human mind... but when we actually talk to each other like this, it&#39;s surprising how well we can communicate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s a little late for that, isn&#39;t it?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera laughs at Midley&#39;s frankness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Carrera, Midley smiled at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If you are aiming for strength, I can&#39;t lose either. If your body is weak after a little bit of exertion, you are still lacking in kung fu. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hahaha. You&#39;ve already mastered it, but you still want to train harder than that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course not. I have to push my mind and body to the limit so that I can give it my all for a longer period of time. Carrera-dono would be a good partner for me, don&#39;t you think?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good. I&#39;ve been thinking of training my body more, which was given to me by Milord. I am willing to take you up on your offer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera and Midley shook hands firmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since both of them have the same goal of aiming higher, there is no reason for them to refuse the offer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim joins the conversation in his usual fashion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s not fair! You&#39;re cheating!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was full of joy and was very nonchalant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, Milim, don&#39;t you need to get stronger?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. Milim-sama is the strongest, so he doesn&#39;t need any special training, does he?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera is also the best, but there is always a better one. It is a well-known fact that Milim is out of his league, and Carrera understood it as much as he could after he came here and started to hang out with Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, Carrera is still one of the better ones and can respond to most of the crazy requests with a smile, but this is not the case with Midley. Unlike Carrera, Midley was trying to be very serious and reserved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Milim did not understand her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wa-ha-ha! What are you talking about? I will not allow myself to be left out of the fun!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, he decided to join the event.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta was the one who read the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sensed the danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Gobta saw Milim coming down from the sky, he overheard what was going on. He sensed something disturbing in the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sensed that he would be forced to join the group, and decided to make a strategic retreat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an excellent assessment of the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to report my victory!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he straddled the united Ranga and ran away from the scene like the wind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can be said that Ranga&#39;s constant attention to the situation around him and his willingness to keep abreast of useful information saved Gobta&#39;s life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga trusts Gobta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His ability to foresee danger had helped him many times, so he followed Gobta&#39;s advice without any doubt here. As a result, Ranga also succeeded in escaping.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for the others... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm? What do you mean? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Milim, are you trying to drag me into this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only Midley and Carrera, who were the first to be captured, but also Karion and Frey were forced to join the war against their will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, it seemed that the war in this region had ended without any fatal damage, although it had caused a great deal of damage.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">- &#39;Blizzard, freeze everything and put it to sleep&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if aiming for the moment when everyone was caught off guard, the world turned white. A blizzard of despair swirled from the outer edges of the battlefield to the center, encircling everyone so that no one would escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No way, you are...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim was the first to notice, but by then it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had been completely caught off guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not many people can fool a cunning demon lord like Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was an impossible feat for Velzard the Frost Dragon, the eldest sister of the True Dragon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Milim.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What are you doing, Velzard? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I&#39;m here to see my lovely niece. I need your help with something. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t you dare. If you&#39;re going to ask me for a favor, you should behave accordingly. Now get rid of that blizzard. Then we&#39;ll talk!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim, holding back his anger, intimidates Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they did not, their friends would be in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, those on the outer rim are already frozen into icicles. They are not dead, but even their vital activities have ceased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sounds good to say that they are in a state of suspended animation, but their lives will be destroyed at the will of Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim understands this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was caught completely off guard at the moment when he was relaxed, right after the fight to the death with Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey felt more threatened than Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Milim became furious and stormed out, this area would be burnt to ashes. If that happened, the scale of damage would be unimaginable, and we did not even know how many people would survive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I have to make a decision...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey decided that it would be dangerous for Milim to let Velzard do what he wanted now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The longer he delayed, the worse the situation would become. Thinking this way, Frey sent an order to the &quot;Heavenly Host&quot; without Milim&#39;s approval.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Strike Velzard!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that voice as a signal, the &quot;Heavenly Shoguns&quot; moved in unison.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one knows the terror of Velzard. Everyone was prepared to die in this suicide attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim, their beloved master, is too kind to the point of fatality. The more people who fall asleep as ice sculptures, the more Milim&#39;s patience will reach its end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once that happened, there was no way out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even now, he is forced to endure, out of consideration for Frey and the others. If the situation worsened any further, they would have no choice but to follow Velzard&#39;s lead for fear of sacrifice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To Frey&#39;s knowledge, the only time Milim fought seriously was when he clashed with Guy, long before Frey was born, to destroy the country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Milim fights seriously with the intention of killing his opponents without worrying about the cost to his allies, he will never have a hard time against any opponent. Yet, Milim always did not fight seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, they have become Milim&#39;s stumbling block.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of this kind Milim, Frey moved so that they would not be a burden to Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn, we&#39;re late. You guys can run away if you want to, but if you&#39;re going to stay, you&#39;d better be prepared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;One crisis after another. And this time it&#39;s the aunt of our lord. I don&#39;t like a war we can&#39;t win, but for Milim-sama&#39;s sake, we can&#39;t whine about it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion announced, and Midley followed him with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, no one left the &quot;flying beast cavalry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The priestly order, led by Hermes, had also abandoned their role as medics and switched to battle mode.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Milim&#39;s men rushed to Velzard at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, you guys, stop! Get out of here now!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if to drown out Milim&#39;s screams, a flurry of magic and air bullets were concentrated on Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Milim-sama is loved. I wish I could have served you earlier. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera mutters to herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle with Peliod had burned her to the ground, and she was running out of energy. However, Obera stood up again and stared at Velzard firmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzard is an absolute force to be reckoned with. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frankly speaking, the probability of winning was zero.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey could not have been unaware of this, and if he had only wanted to survive, he would have ordered his army to &#39;break up and leave the scene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why he did not do so may be...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Fufu, she&#39;s a cunning one, isn&#39;t she? I didn&#39;t dislike her before, but I admire her determination.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey&#39;s goal is to get Milim to abandon his doubts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they are killed by Velzard, Milim will have no reason to hesitate. Frey made a split-second decision that if Milim survived, it was all right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion and Midley followed him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their subordinates also made the choice to share their fate without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all love Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera was the same way, so he could understand their feelings. He respected those who had made the same decision as those he had lost, and he too was prepared for this place of death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, who remained here, was also thinking about what he should do in this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An endurance battle against the flawless Velzard was impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzard was not as gentle as Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no way for Carrera to win against Velzard, and it depended on their luck whether they could escape from this place or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, escape is not an option in Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It is no use. I should go along with them, even though it would mean disobeying Milord&#39;s order. Velzard-sama is no problem for them. Let&#39;s give it our best shot!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Well, the decision was made quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be a good disaster for Carrera&#39;s men, but none of them could escape from this place anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Victory over Velzard was the only way out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, everyone understood that this would never happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Therefore, the only thing Carrera and the others could do was to lead the souls of the many dead who would emerge from this place and keep them away from the true death.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.1y810tw"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Get fired up, boys. Don&#39;t let anyone slip through your fingers.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera&#39;s words were met with a collective nod of approval from her men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now there was no more time for recovery. The demons give up their incarnated bodies and return to their original forms of spiritual life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although their influence on the material world will be reduced, it is more rational for them to lead the dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, in a very short time, everyone is ready.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the next moment...</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">- The cold intention of &quot;You&#39;re stupid.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">echoed in the minds of all those present on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a quiet voice, drowned by the blizzard, but it carried a huge wave of thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps in response to the voice, the blizzard turned into a blizzard, whiteouting the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an unreasonable violence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A supernatural disaster of such an unimaginable scale appeared on the battlefield that the concept of &quot;resistance&quot; is laughable.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill006.jpg" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">- &#39;Now, go to sleep&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The white ice and snow are raging.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soldiers are the first to be transformed into icicles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the captains, and even the top brass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only a few are left. Only those who had reached the Million-class level remained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was only a matter of time... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Witnessing the hopelessness of the situation, Frey prepared for his death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karion and Midley did the same.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only reason they are still standing is that Milim is protecting them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If not, Frey and the others would have been completely destroyed by the energy that Velzard had unleashed a long time ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a proof of this, Carrera, who was located at a short distance from Milim, was unable to even shed her body, and her movements were blocked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera, the king of demons, was like that. Her men are no different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, needless to say, the &quot;Heavenly Shoguns&quot; under Frey, the &quot;Flying Horsemen&quot; under Karion, and Midley&#39;s men, the priests and priestesses, are all under Frey&#39;s control. The priests and warriors under Karion, Midley&#39;s men, and others had all been wiped out by the ice sculptures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzard had not even attacked them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This blizzard was merely a release of his supremacy. For those who understood this, the phenomenon was a feeling of helpless despair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim, who is protecting Frey, is unable to move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Milim abandons Frey and the others, their fate is doomed at that moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Oh, sweet Milim. You&#39;re a sweetie after all. I love you!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey thought sincerely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frey felt a gaze on him and turned his attention to Karion, who was smiling wickedly at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Midley let out a big sigh and nodded to Karion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obera was praying silently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seemed to be apologizing to someone, &quot;Sorry, guys.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the image of those who had made their decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;You&#39;re ready, aren&#39;t you? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. Let&#39;s set them all off at once with as much flair as we can. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;&#39;Yes. If we&#39;re going to fall anyway, let&#39;s give Milim-sama one last show of bravery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I finally understand how my men feel now. Yes, I do. They didn&#39;t die in vain. Then I&#39;ll have to bring them some bragging rights too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Four Heavenly Kings under Milim were united in that moment. And then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait for me, boys!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They acted faster than Milim could stop them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The coordination among the four of us was nothing short of brilliant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if they had been warriors for 1,000 years, they closed in on Velzard with a series of blows without a moment&#39;s margin of error.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But alas, all of them were not enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m glad, really. You were as strong as I expected you to be, that&#39;s why I was able to deal with you without any madness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzard smiled and remained standing there coldly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In front of her, four new ice sculptures were born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, Milim&#39;s expression freezes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is an expression in which all the other emotions have fallen away, leaving only one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, a look of rage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim was furious because his friends had been taken from him.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will not forgive you. You took my friend! I will never forgive you !!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s cry pierced the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, Milim&#39;s Ultimate Skill &#39;Wrath King (Satanael)&#39; begins to work at full power. Taking in the surrounding magicules and pouring in all of his mana, he continues to create more and more power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fueled by the rage and magicules generated by Milim, it is the ultimate power that multiplies more and more magicules. The &#39;magicule multiplying furnace&#39; so powerful that it cannot be used is the true nature of the Ultimate Skill &#39;Wrath King (Satanael)&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The magicule that is fed as fuel is reduced to further power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were literally &quot;multiplying&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as this is activated, the amount of magicule in Milim will continue to increase rapidly. Moreover, no matter how much we consume, it never decreases, which is the ultimate power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The name of the Dragon Princess, the bastard child of Veldanava, was not an exaggeration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim, the demon lord, was the one who controlled the infinite power of one individual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again, Milim roars loudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, the heavens shook and the earth shattered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mythical-grade armor that envelops Milim&#39;s body changes into a hideous shape as if it were responding to his passion. It does not protect Milim from the outside enemy, but rather keeps him from being defeated by the power within.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The overflowing torrent of power fuses with the armor, transforms it, and covers Milim&#39;s entire body. Milim&#39;s transformation is complete.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On his back were a pair of jet-black wings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A single red horn sprouted from his forehead, shining in iridescent colors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of his bare skin was covered with hard, shining dragon scales with mysterious patterns and dull, shifting colors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the true form of Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the true form of the Dragon Princess, who, despite being a human being, had a power in her body that surpassed that of the &quot;True Dragon,&quot; and manifested as the embodiment of absolute destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh my, this is the second time I&#39;ve seen you like this. Since we&#39;re here, shall I play with you for a while?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kill him.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no one left to stop Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heaven and earth rumbled with the wrath of the ancient demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately thereafter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The world is once again exposed to the wrath of majin, the ultimate dragon.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.4i7ojhp"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-007.png" src="images/image29.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.2xcytpi"></a><a id="id.1ci93xb"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-008.png" src="images/image32.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.3whwml4"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Velzard&#39;s on the move.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway nodded back at Vega, who was staring at the video with a pallid expression on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn, Demon Lord Milim and Zelanus are even more powerful than I thought they would be... Damn, they&#39;re powerful as hell. If they can laugh at that, it means that Velzard is not as strong as I am now....&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Vega seemed to have realized the reality of the situation when he saw Milim and Zelanus fighting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how confident Vega was, he could at least understand the difference between Milim and Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t be so sad. I, too, have my own feelings when I heard that our long-time enemy, insectar, has been destroyed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is Zalario, who has just been recalled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Milim forces had won a victory against a powerful enemy that had tormented them so much. Moreover, despite the heavy damage, there were no casualties among Milim&#39;s men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may be said that it was a difference in conditions and strategy, but Zalario was at fault when he could not prepare for it. In any case, it was no excuse, and the reality was that Milim&#39;s team was better than Zalario&#39;s team.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder Zalario was not amused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, what are you going to do, Feldway? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The statement was a question about Velzard&#39;s behavior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seemed to be planning something, but Feldway left it alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario thinks that the rapidly changing situation is a major deviation from the original plan, and he wants to say that it is time to change course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there was one more person who was indignant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s it. If you had not interfered with me, I would have defeated the divine enemy by now! Let&#39;s hear your explanation of what you&#39;re up to!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Returning to the Heavenly Star Palace, Feldway ordered Mai to visualize the war situation on the ground. He then ordered Zalario to bring back Jahil, who had created a diversion to Luminas&#39; camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil&#39;s action was also too flashy to be called a diversion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario was right to stop him, but Jahil, who was stopped, was not amused. He asked Feldway, as if he was going to attack him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t be in such a hurry. You couldn&#39;t have taken down Demon Lord Luminas by yourself anyway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What, are you taunting me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not. I only want to proceed with caution. Behold, Dagruel has joined our ranks and the balance of forces is now greatly in our favor. With Fenn as a &quot;three-star general,&quot; Luminas is a distant memory. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway told Jahil to calm the angry Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Jahil&#39;s dissatisfaction did not disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I recognize Fenn&#39;s power. But I have to take care of Luminas, the avenger of our great ancestor, with my own hands!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Jahil&#39;s frustration was a grudge born of anger. Whether or not the takeover of Footman had any effect on him is not clear, but his heart was boiling with anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why he attacked Luminas in a somewhat violent manner. When he was stopped, Jahil was so furious that he wondered why he was furious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the next moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Can&#39;t you hear my words?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was Feldway&#39;s quiet, unspoken statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not intimidating, but was uttered in a normal manner. And yet, the air of authority that overpowered the situation caused even Dino and the others who were not participating in the conversation to become tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no, it was my fault. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil regained his composure and immediately apologized. It was a very wise decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Feldway, your supremacy is poisonous to those who are not accustomed to it. Remember that now that you are in your true form, you are nothing compared to what you used to be.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario defends Jahil, and the situation is finally settled.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so we are back to where we started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Currently, Feldway has three strategic goals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To get the Ultimate Skill &#39;Hope King (Sariel)&#39; from Hero Chronoa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliminate Hero Masayuki as a risk factor. This includes the capture of the Ultimate Skill &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most important objective was to get the &#39;Dragon Factor&#39; from Veldora.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway decided to rethink the objectives.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, he thought about the collection of the authority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he has inherited Michael&#39;s power, Feldway can identify the angelic Ultimate Skill.... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Michael, not Feldway, who was concerned about collecting angelic powers. Since he himself was the will that resided in the powers, he thought that he could reach the all-powerful power by consolidating the other powers into one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All-powerful - in other words, the return of the omniscient and omnipotent Creator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the logic seems to make sense, Feldway was skeptical.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason is that Veldanava was not omniscient and omnipotent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the first place, Veldanava himself had said that he had renounced omniscience and omnipotence, so there was no room for doubting his words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the contrary, Feldway even thinks how nice it would be if Veldanava himself had lied. If it were, he would not have lost his power and been killed by humans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then again, it is Veldanava himself who has given the humans their desires. The result of this is a cycle of cause and effect, and it is self-inflicted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Feldway did not doubt that Veldanava was not omniscient and omnipotent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For this reason, it did not seem to make sense to look for the missing authority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, it is meaningless to have all the powers if there are no recipients.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway and Michael had planned to manifest Veldanava by using the best body of the lineage of the &quot;first heroes&quot; as a vessel. However, this plan has completely failed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael was defeated and his body was lost. Now that this has happened, I should have thought that Masayuki was no longer a priority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Emperor Masayuki, huh? I hate to be in a losing situation, but victory or defeat is just a matter of time. It&#39;s not worth losing sight of the bigger picture.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway decided so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario and his team would have no chance against Masayuki, who had the power of True Hero Rudra in his hands. Moreover, with Velgrynd in their ranks, they would only be beaten back with a half-hearted effort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least, Feldway himself or Velzard would have to go there, or ask Zelanus. Even if they won the war, there seemed to be little to be gained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, the objective of the game would be narrowed down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Masayuki was left alone, there was no point in defeating Hero Chronoa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if we eventually get rid of Masayuki, there is no need to target him. They could just wait for him to come toward them and avoid dispersing their valuable forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(After all, all hope is lost, isn&#39;t it?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaking off these fears, Feldway&#39;s thoughts came together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, what are you going to do?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil asked impatiently at the right moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We only target the Veldora factor. However, we need to move in such a way that they don&#39;t know our true mission. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway then proposed a new strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After everyone left, Feldway muttered to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, well, will Velzard accomplish what he set out to do?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzard holds the key to victory in this battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least, that&#39;s what Feldway thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Her love is real. If so, the outcome will not be changed...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was convinced of this and smiled coldly at the beauty.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the Holy Empire of Lubelius, where Shion and Adalmann were sent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was sitting on the sofa, relaxing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next to me, Shion is proudly asking for more tea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ladies-in-waiting of Luminas responded to my request. Shion accepts it as a matter of course, and eats the tea set on the table, but I guess she has nothing to be nervous about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&#39;s that? I should be in a better position than her, but this difference in reaction is strange, isn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why am I the master of this place so nervous, while Shion, who is supposed to be my secretary, seems to be unconcerned...? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I can&#39;t think about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rimuru-sama, these sweets are delicious. I&#39;ve tasted it, please!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion offered it to me, and I popped it into my mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wondered what kind of a joke it was that Shion, who is not a good cook, was going to poison me, but it was OK. I don&#39;t need to be poisoned, though, since poisons don&#39;t work on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sure tastes good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion may not have the best sense of aesthetics, but he does have a good sense of taste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I say it&#39;s unreasonable... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because, you know, he didn&#39;t taste the food he made before serving it to us. Now that I&#39;m working on perfecting the taste with Skill, the appearance and texture are still not good enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How is it, is it good?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, it is. It&#39;s not too sweet and crisp, and I enjoy the way it loosens up in my mouth.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This pastry is like a financier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was seriously delicious, with a subtle savory accent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion heard my reply and broke into a big smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he dropped a bombshell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That was good! I was confident again, and I&#39;m glad Rimuru-sama was pleased!&quot;Hmm? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped moving and stared at Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was the same smile as ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned my eyes to the sweets in my hand, and then looked at Shion again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Could this be...?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes! I made them.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s Uso, isn&#39;t it ? Hey! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These statements were hard to believe, but they seemed to be true. It had been a long time since I saw Shion&#39;s smug face, but I could forgive him for bragging about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion has finally conquered the look and the texture of the food.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Did you make this taste and shape with your skill?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, sir. I made it with my own hands!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was showing tremendous progress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess the change of environment is very important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna and Benimaru had not been able to improve their skills no matter how many times Shion and Benimaru had told them to do so, but they have suddenly awakened since they came to another country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what was the trigger?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I was thinking that, I heard a voice answering my question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I had a hard time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas came into the reception room blurting out that he had had a hard time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas greeted me as I was getting up from my seat, saying, &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; and then he sat down on the sofa himself, as if there was no need to thank me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he started to continue what he had just said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s the matter? You said you can cook with confidence, so I entrusted you to cook, and you prepared a novel-looking dish that is hardly food at all!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas&#39; words are strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The word &quot; novelty &quot; is so heavy that I can&#39;t help but get a little mystified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And what&#39;s more! It&#39;s hard to understand why the texture is so bad but the taste is so good. Some people are even trying to reproduce it for fun. I&#39;m so worried about the negative impact on our food culture that even I (Ruminas voice) had to move in!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seems to be very depressed and angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t help but say, &quot;Ugh ! I was at a loss for words to say back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But, I&#39;m glad you were able to correct Shion. We had given up on you a long time ago. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I tried to cover it up for the time being, Luminas gave me a glare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion also looked at me with a disgruntled expression on her cheeks in protest. I pretended not to notice this and waited for Luminas&#39; answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I can imagine how much you guys have spoiled Shion, but it is none of I&#39;s (Ruminas voice) business. I (Ruminas voice) was going to leave it alone, but I can&#39;t say so now that it has started to do some harm. So, I (Ruminas voice) told him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may be a misnomer to say that I spoiled him, but it may seem so from the side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just that Shuna, but Benimaru and I couldn&#39;t take a strong attitude toward Shion because we can&#39;t cook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think it&#39;s quite rude to point out to others what you can&#39;t do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I was hoping that Shuna or Gobichi-kun would give me a bad advice... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shuna was too kind. And he gave up too soon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobichi-kun was too weak to reach Shion&#39;s heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The taste had improved, and the death toll was not so high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should have tried cooking myself and tried to be close to Shion&#39;s feelings, since I have a long slime life ahead of me. If I had done so, I might have found more things to be improved and this problem might have been solved earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was my fault and Benimaru&#39;s fault that we turned our eyes away from our weak areas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I reflect on this, Luminas gives me an answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It may be laced with poison, so taste it before serving it to our guests!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&#39;s why Shion said &quot;poisoned&quot; earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was indeed a good idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion doesn&#39;t have a strange sense of taste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he gets into the habit of tasting the food himself, he would naturally realize the problem of the dish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re a brilliant man, Luminas. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said, expressing my admiration from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas turned away and said, &quot;Hmph! and turned away from me, his cheeks dyed with a little embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was an unexpected good news that Shion&#39;s cooking would be improved, but it had nothing to do with the purpose of our visit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris reported that the battle between Milim and the bugdemon Lord Zelanus was at a stalemate. At the same time, the capital of Lubelius, the seat of Luminas, was being attacked by angels from the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim had sent Gobta and others to reinforce him, so it seemed safe to assume that he would be safe for the time being. With Milim there, they should be able to handle the situation as long as it was not too much trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Luminas, although he had sent Shion and Adalmann to support him, was not sure about his strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, the Holy Knight Order, which is the key to the strength of the Luminas, had been placed in the Kingdom of Ingracia with Hinata, the leader of the Holy Knight Order, at the head. Luminas also has a force called Bloody Knights, which consists of vampires, but it has only less than 400 members.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The strength of the Bloody Knights is Over A rank individually, and there are several &quot;Surmounters&quot; who are comparable to a bad &quot;Demon Lord Seed&quot;. The quality of the team is quite high. Even so, I could not remain silent when I heard that Jahil had been confirmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I left the cleanup at the Kingdom of Ingracia to Hinata and Masayuki, and came here in a great hurry. And yet, there was already no sign of a fight, and I was led here, tasting Shion&#39;s sweets and waiting for Luminas to come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it had been only a few minutes at most before Luminas appeared on the stage. I was so surprised by Shion&#39;s progress that I spent more time talking with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I changed my mind and got down to the main topic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, how did the battle with the angels go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They retreated, so there was no serious damage. It seems that attacking here was not part of the plan in the first place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas gave me a detailed account of the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As it turned out, it seems that the attack on this place was a runaway attack by Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or, as he put it, he was being harassed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He and I (Ruminas voice) have a history. He and I (Ruminas voice) have a history of disagreements. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I asked him what he meant, he did not tell me, but when I told him that Silvia-san had told me some of the story, he told me with a disgusted look on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First of all, Luminas had a father figure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Twilight Valentine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A mythical being whose name means &quot;King of the Twilight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is said that this Twilight created many intelligent life forms, and that some of the founders of these life forms became known as the Godfather&#39;s High Disciples.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first of them was Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second was Luminas, as Silvia-san had told me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each of the disciples of the godfathers established their own country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Silvia-san&#39;s case, it seems that he himself only supported and helped his fellow high elf, but in the end, the elf was united by his daughter, Elmesia the Celestial, who is called Eltan, and the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty of Sarion was born. In the end, the elf was united by her daughter, Elmeia the Celestial, and the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty of Sarion was born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Silvia-san and Luminas are said to have a secret friendship even now. It is said that Silvia-san has nothing to do with Ertan, but is only known to Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Basically, I don&#39;t think we should interfere with Sarion,&quot; says Luminas. But I did help him out in the beginning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Sarion was founded more than 2,000 years ago, we do not know if Luminas&#39; story is true or not. However, there is no reason for them to lie, since Luminas and Silvia-san are like a living person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was convinced that it was probably true, and listened to the rest of the story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was told that Luminas and Silvia-san are the only two of his disciples who are still alive today. At least, no one else seems to be in contact with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ancestor of King Gazel, the founder of the High Dwarfs, is said to have died, and the founders of the Fire Spirits (Enki) and the Water Spirits (Sirens) have probably reached the end of their lives. It seems that the only people who lived long lives were the high elf, which is close to spirits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaking of longevity, the high humans are the most likely to have lived a long life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This race was created purely by reversing the attributes of the ancestors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I hate to admit it, but I (Ruminas voice) am a kind of duplicate of the Ancestor, not strictly speaking a vampire but a high blooded princess. She was born from the blood of the Ancestor. And Jahil is created by cultivating the body of the Goddess. He does not seem to have inherited the power to absorb power from others, but he, too, was a near-immortal being. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The god ancestor did not need to eat, but deprived others of their life force to sustain itself. He had no particular weakness and was the embodiment of immortality. The two replicas of the Gods were the high human, a race that lives in the daytime, and the vampire, the ruler of the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Living in the daytime is a metaphor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Plants produce energy through photosynthesis, and animals sustain life by eating them. Predation of the animals, predators store large amounts of energy, and the earth is enriched by the decomposition of their corpses by microorganisms. The role of the high human is given to the person who stands at the top of the Food Chain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, the high human is a part of the Food Chain. Therefore, it is impossible to escape from life span, and Jahil was no exception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The average lifespan of a normal person living in an urban area is about seventy years old. This is the case without any magical means to prolong life. Although medical care is not well developed, people seem to live longer than expected because of magical cures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People living in rural areas or in areas adjacent to monster forests seem to have a shorter average life expectancy. I should also add that these figures are calculated without including deaths due to numerous disasters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, high humans seem to live several hundred to nearly a thousand years, which is equivalent to that of the long-eared (elf) people. It seems that their physical strength is different from that of the present humans, and they have a high tolerance to magicule, so they could have successfully taken in and used it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, we cannot escape our life span as long as our bodies are not immortal... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Jahil devised a method to extend his own lifespan indefinitely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the &quot;secret of spiritualization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the three elements of the body, material body, spiritual body, and astral body, cannot be maintained at the same time, he thought it would be better to inherit only the lowest element that can maintain the ego.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Jahil succeeded in converting the material body into the spiritual body in order to preserve only the spiritual body and the astral body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Jahil was reborn as a spiritual life form of his own will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mystic art of Reincarnation developed by Gadra is very dangerous because it is a secret technique to reincarnate a soul while protecting it with an astral body. However, the body obtained is completely one&#39;s own, and all the experience and knowledge are inherited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Razen&#39;s great secret art: Possession only transfers the spiritual body and the astral body to another person&#39;s body, but does not inherit any skills that are fixed in the body. It is highly secure, but it is incomplete, because mana is dependent on the body and may become weak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Jahil&#39;s &quot;secret of spiritualization&quot; was perfect. Since Jahil himself is a spiritual organism, he can safely and surely inherit the knowledge, experience, and all the powers he has gained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It is necessary to prepare a body as a surrogate, but it seems that he could have obtained such a body from his own blood relatives as much as he wanted. Thus, Jahil solved the problem of longevity,&quot; Luminas said bitterly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas told me bitterly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, if he had become a spirit life form, it makes sense that he was nearly immortal. I now understood that this was the reason why he had been able to take over Footman so easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But he made a big mistake, too, because of his pride. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas told me that while Jahil was absorbed in his own research, his subordinates who were in charge of politics began to compete with each other for supremacy, and before long the country was divided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eventually, the country was doomed by the mistake of summoning Guy, an uncontrollable demon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He resented I (Ruminas voice) for destroying the ancestors and harbored enmity toward him. I was glad to think that they died on their own. I didn&#39;t think that he would survive until the present time and resurrect with such abominable power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas had killed his father, the godfather.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil had a grudge against Luminas for that reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a pain in the ass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well. It&#39;s so troublesome that my Benimaru is having a hard time with it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was giving Luminas some advice, Shion overheard me and interrupted me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? Benimaru lost ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps he was surprised, but it was assumed that Benimaru had lost. I think I told this story to all the executives, but I wonder if it has been lost in Shion&#39;s memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it seems like Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m not defeated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I corrected Shion&#39;s words on Benimaru&#39;s honor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In my opinion, if you don&#39;t die, you win...but in reality, you only managed to make it to the end of the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the fight had continued as it was, there was no doubt that Benimaru would have lost. There was no doubt that Benimaru was a threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see, then Luminas-sama who defeated such an opponent is stronger than Benimaru, isn&#39;t he?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what I was wondering, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, in my opinion, there is not such a big difference in strength between Luminas and Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I thought Luminas and Benimaru were in danger, and that&#39;s why I rushed to the scene. I also wanted to know how Luminas had defeated Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So that&#39;s what this is about,&quot; Luminas said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas began to talk casually.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I (Ruminas voice) have an experience that some evil dragon destroyed my city...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Boom !</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This sounds like something I&#39;ve heard somewhere... no, it sounds like something I&#39;ve received many complaints about... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;When building a city, the first priority is to ensure safety.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see. I think that&#39;s an excellent idea...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t help but take a polite tone, but I chose to be pleased without hesitation here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas took a cold look at me, and then continued the conversation as if he was relieved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I had set up several layers of &#39;barriers&#39; against the evil dragon, and they worked well. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that you mention it, I remember that there were indeed many layers of &#39;Defense Barriers&#39; in this sacred place. We were allowed to pass through, but no one suspicious could get through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t think it was that strong. Jahil had the power to overpower Benimaru and seemed to control the Ultimate Skill. I knew that a half-hearted &#39;Barrier&#39; would not work, though not as well as Veldora. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said honestly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas snickered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t you dare! This is a sacred place for those who believe in I (Ruminas voice), whereas other places are not so sacred. With faith that springs from the infinite, it is easy to repel the power of Jahil. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His words were confident, and in fact, the results proved to be true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But so easy?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">- Applying the Secret of Faith and Grace, it should be theoretically possible</span><span class="c0">.

I can&#39;t even imagine how hard it is for me now.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It </span><span class="c3">is not a work that can be done only by an individual.

It is impossible to achieve it overnight, but do you also want to achieve it?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not only my problem... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s put it on hold for now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san seems to agree with my answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, there are many other projects that are left untouched, though they seem to be useful in many ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, we are still in the middle of a war, so we cannot afford to face the residents of our country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We put this matter on the back burner for the time being as a future issue.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that we know the reason why Luminas was able to survive, the problem is not yet solved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather, the real work is yet to come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, Dagruel has turned. They are on the march now, so I think we will be in contact with them within a week at the latest.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told Luminas the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said that Dagruel&#39;s brother, Fenn, had done something to him and that he had become a changed man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t actually see Dagruel, but I learned it from Ultima&#39;s report, but from a distance, Dagruel seemed to be wearing an evil haki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The army of giants following such Dagruel was also ominous, so I expected that the battle would be quite fierce when the time came to fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil was a kind of a starter, and Dagruel was the main objective.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were marching on foot, but it would not take them long to reach here, judging from the way they were marching through the &quot;Deadly Desert&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frankly speaking, Dagruel&#39;s defection is painful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had assumed this possibility, but when it became a reality, it was too much of a headache.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Dagruel and I (Ruminas voice) have been on bad terms for a long time. Dagruel and the goddess were on good terms, although the conflict of interest was one of the reasons. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, come on, after Jahil, is God ancestor also the cause of the disagreement with Dagruel ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. Well, it&#39;s a done deal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas says this without seeming to care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apparently, this is a story from the time when Dagruel was called an evil god. So Luminas doesn&#39;t seem to mind, but if that&#39;s the case, it seems as if Dagruel is trying to settle his grudge right now... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Therefore, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we end up in a head-on war with him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having said that, I think Dagruel is really strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe, but even I would have a hard time...</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;No </span><span class="c12">way</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-but Ciel-san seems to have a different opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that&#39;s all right. I don&#39;t mean to argue with you here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t want to be a fool who underestimates the enemy and loses, so I have to determine that the threat is at a level that I will have a hard time with, and I have to think of a countermeasure.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;Yes, sir </span><span class="c12">.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am glad to hear that you agree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, let&#39;s think about what we should do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the geopolitical viewpoint, Holy Empire of Lubelius is the key to defend the western part of the country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is defeated, it will gain a foothold to the Western Nations, and the situation will be tilted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The army of angels can fly, and there is no way to intercept them at any point. Fortunately, the army of giants is on foot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was much faster than walking, and perhaps because they used some kind of legion magic, their average speed was 30 km/h, which is unthinkable for a normal army, but it was still better than being attacked from the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The distance from Damargania, the base of Dagruel, to here, the holy city of Rune, is about 2,000 kilometers in a straight line. Even if we assume that we do not bypass the barren lands and the deadly deserts, the distance to be traveled is about 3,000 kilometers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even by simple calculations, it would take more than four full days to reach the destination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since they would need to take a rest, it would normally take more than three times as long...but from what I recall from the glimpses of their march, it seemed that they would come without a break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the meantime, I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on them with the Argus spell. If there is any change, I should be able to detect it.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Argus </span><span class="c3">&quot; is easy to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;fool. We </span><span class="c3">can&#39;t deny that a cautious enemy might be taking countermeasures</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re right, aren&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Argus is a magic to see what&#39;s going on in the area in real time, so there&#39;s no way to confirm if the scene has been tampered with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, I&#39;m taking countermeasures on the assumption that I&#39;m being watched. So, if the enemy can manipulate the same kind of magic, we should assume that they have some kind of countermeasures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, I might just be worrying too much...but in any case, I was sure that we must not let our guard down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was something else to worry about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The story that we were able to intercept Jahil, I think we should not take it at face value. Since the objective of the mission was to turn Dagruel, it would have been logical to attack Luminas between them if they were to defeat him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why they did not do so is probably because of Jahil&#39;s outburst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard that Luminas has a history with Jahil, and he might have had some kind of plan, but from what I heard, I thought that Jahil&#39;s outburst, in other words, might have caused confusion in the enemy&#39;s chain of command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas has a considerable amount of power, but if they were sandwiched between an army of giants attacking from the west and an army of angels from the sky, they would be helplessly overrun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems to me that the enemy was not consistent when they did not do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, since I had arrived in time, I wanted to be in a perfect position to intercept the Dagruel forces before they arrived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, how much time do we have left?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Assuming that we maintain our marching speed, we can expect Dagruel&#39;s army to arrive in four days at the earliest. Hinata and the others will be back soon, but just in time for the decisive battle, I&#39;d say. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm. At worst, I&#39;d like to call Hinata back immediately...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ingracia. I left the cleanup in King&#39;s Landing to you and came here as soon as I could. I have to escort the important people of each country, and it will be difficult until I finish the handover.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not only Hinata, but also calling the Holy Knight Order back would be a good idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ingracia is still not safe with Masayuki. They have defeated Feldway, but the next attack may be a full-scale one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, Masayuki has Velgrynd-san, and Testarossa is still there. The Imperial generals seem to be surprisingly reliable, and the situation is probably better than ours, so I think we can withstand anything that happens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmmm, yes. Hinata is representing the Western Holy Church, so it&#39;s not too much to ask. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reluctantly, Luminas agreed with me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we selfishly called Hinata back at this point, it might be perceived that the Holy Church had abandoned the Western Nations. If that happens, the trust we have built up would be lost at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If things were really at their worst, it might be inevitable, but I am here to prevent that from happening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I&#39;ve brought Gadra, one of my men, with me, so he should be discussing the defense with Adalmann by now. He&#39;s not as good as Hinata, but he&#39;s dependable, so I don&#39;t think you need to worry that much. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I said this, Luminas gave me an indignant glare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are too optimistic! You don&#39;t know the horror of Dagruel, that&#39;s why you can talk so carelessly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no, no, I think Dagruel is dangerous, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just that Ciel-san&#39;s easy-going attitude makes me feel relieved and relaxed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t like to be called a &quot;no-bullshit&quot; person, but I think I&#39;ll be a snake if I talk back to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I swallow my complaint in a mature manner and move on to the next topic before he can make any more comments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyway, let&#39;s check the strength of the team,&quot; I suggested. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t expect him to tell me everything honestly because it is a military secret of another country. Even so, if we don&#39;t ask them, we can&#39;t even plan a proper operation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I asked him the most important question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let me ask you frankly, how many &quot;Surmounters&quot; are there?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is quite rude, but this is the most important question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, since we cannot rely on the Holy Knight Order&#39;s captains, we really want to know what we can expect from them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From this point onward, it is better not to count those who are less than A rank in the strength. Especially if you have seen Carrera and so on, I even thought that it would be better not to bring them to the battlefield, if they would be wiped out by a single shot of a large-scale magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, the Holy Empire of Lubelius has announced the existence of a main force of Templar Knights, consisting of knights who believe in Luminism, as its defense force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their number is 10,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>They are, after all, the knights who protect the holy land, and are of a higher rank than those who have been dispatched to other countries. The combat ability of the knights is said to be equivalent to </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 16.00px; height: 16.00px;"><img alt="B+" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 16.00px; height: 16.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rank at least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sorry to say it, but from my point of view, they&#39;re just as good as the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we consider them in the category of human beings, they are strong, but I can only see a future in which they will be kicked out in front of Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, it depends on the operation, but my character does not allow me to consider a soldier as a mere number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is not a game, and we should aim for zero casualties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that case, I would like to have only the main force to do the fighting, and the others to assist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanted them to fulfill their duty to protect the holy place as &#39;Barrier&#39; maintenance personnel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas seemed to have understood my thinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Seven are the most promising. The demon lord&#39;s army, which I (Ruminas voice) have entrusted to his shadow, has established a ruling system of seven great nobles, with Roy, or rather Louis, as the top king. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, this is more impressive than I expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am surprised that Mr. Surmounter, who is a good friend of Vesta&#39;s, is one of the seven nobles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Gunther-san, the butler of Luminas, is not included in the seven names.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This Gunther is also one of the high disciples of the god ancestor. In other words, he and I (Ruminas voice) are like a sister and brother. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am in awe of your words. I, Luminas-sama, am far behind.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas introduced Gunther-san, who was preparing more tea for us. I knew him well and thought he was quite strong, but when he told me who he was, I was convinced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He also told me that Louis was also a work of the godfather. I was a little doubtful if I could call it a work of art or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was a bit doubtful if I could call it a work of art, though, since I heard that it was created but escaped and became wild and rampaging. I heard that it caused a lot of damage until Luminas took it down and brought it under his control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, it was a long time ago, so I can&#39;t say anything about it now, but I heard that it was one of the better episodes concerning the god ancestors, so I can remember how hard Luminas had to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The seven great nobles are derived from such Louis. So, even as a demon lord&#39;s army, he was a dignified man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, now we know the strength of the Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now it is my turn to disclose the information just reported to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;According to the information from Ultima, Dagruel&#39;s force is called the &quot;Binding Chain Giants&quot;, which consists of 30,000 warriors of Giants. The average rank is equivalent to </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 16.00px; height: 16.00px;"><img alt="B+" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 16.00px; height: 16.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rank. The top rank is Over A rank as a matter of course, and there are nearly 1,000 such elite warriors alone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s impressive.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas nodded at my report.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas&#39; statement here is not a comparison between the 30,000 members of the &quot;Bound Titan Clan&quot; and the 10,000 Templar Knights, but refers only to the number of Over A-ranked warriors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not clear why Dagruel brought even lower-ranked warriors, but what should be emphasized is the quality rather than the number of warriors. We can be sure of this, since we have overturned the disadvantage of numbers many times before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, if we compare the quality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas&#39; strength should have been about 400 Blood Red Knights, 300 Holy Knight Order, and nearly 700 Over A ranks. It should not have been so surprising to hear that there were nearly 1,000 members on the Dagruel side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, since the Holy Knight Order was not present, there was no doubt that the Luminas side was overwhelmingly at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the Luminas were defeated and their sacred lands were destroyed, the Western Nations would surely collapse. Not only would the object of faith be lost, but also the existence of the guardian would disappear, and the Western Nations would be completely overrun in less than a month.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Dagruel&#39;s goal is only to destroy the territory, the destruction may be less severe. However, the people living there will suffer, and there is no telling how they will be treated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At a time when our existence has been recognized, and we are about to join hands to create a prosperous and civilized society, it is unthinkable that we should be interfered with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will not allow anyone or anything to interfere with my self-indulgent life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, the defeat of the Luminas camp had to be prevented.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If so, the question is whether the current strength of the Luminas camp is enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The strength of Dagruel is unknown. It was dangerous to underestimate him, because he was said to be so strong that he had a fight with Veldora in the past.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san seemed certain that I would win...but I did not know if I would have to fight or not, since I did not know what would happen in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I needed to be prepared for all kinds of situations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I fight against Luminas, I don&#39;t know who will win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas also possesses the Ultimate Skill of the deadly sins, so I don&#39;t think he will be defeated easily...but it&#39;s better to avoid a fight between generals if at all possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I&#39;m here, you don&#39;t have to worry about it, but you should know the strength of the second-in-command here.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas and Dagruel are said to be the largest faction among demon lords, but their overall strength seems to be almost equal. That is probably why Dagruel did not make any rash moves, but now that the situation has come to this, the strength of the lieutenants and the top level officers should decide the winner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the Luminas side, there are Gunther-san, Louis, and the seven nobles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course, there were strongmen on the Dagruel side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not to mention Dagruel&#39;s younger brothers such as Fenn and Glassord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had heard that there were those who were considered to be equivalent to Demon Lord Seed, though they were one step inferior to such Million-class powerful men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the Five Great Generals, the strongest among the senior fighters of the &quot;Binding Chain Giant Gods&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the famous representative of the five is...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It is troublesome that Fenn is back. Now Dagruel will revert back to the evil god of ancient times, and Basara of the &quot;Four Arms&quot; will be awakened. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, that Basara of the Four Arms is the second-in-command of the Binding Chain Giant Gods. He is said to be as strong as the other deputy, Glassord, so he must be Million-class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, there are too many hidden strongmen, such as the Luminas&#39; forces and the Dagruel&#39;s camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt like asking them how the balance among demon lords is balanced, with Karion and Frey having under their command such fierce fighters who look cute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I complained in exasperation, Luminas answered me casually.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course not, right? I (Ruminas voice) have been demon lords for a long time. They have taken in powerful people and expanded their power. In fact, as new demon lords, Karion and Frey have been worth seeing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a very superior comment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in fact, this phrase &quot;since long ago&quot; was very persuasive. After all, Luminas and Dagruel have been alive not for a thousand or two thousand years, but for thousands of years, or even ten thousands of years, if not more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is said that it is rare for a Dagruel to reach the level of Million-class in a hundred or two hundred years, even if it can reach the level of Demon Lord Seed in a hundred or two hundred years. When he told me that, I had no words to reply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;In that sense, you are an anomaly! How many million-class people do you have under your command? I (Ruminas voice) would like to ask you how you can gather that many people in such a short period of time!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t help but think, &quot;Ugh ! I was so surprised that I couldn&#39;t help but to let out a &quot;Woooooo!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know how it happened, and I can&#39;t find the answer even if you ask me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would not be good for me to continue this story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I decided to ask Luminas something that had been bothering me for a while, as if to cover up the story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;By the way, you know a lot about Dagruel&#39;s camp, did you know about Fenn? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas looked at me with a puzzled look, but accepted my invitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmmm? Of course. The damage had already been sealed when I (Ruminas voice) was born, but there were still traces of the damage. The godfathers used to tell me stories about those days with great pleasure. Besides, it was because of Fenn that the ancestors created the sisters Kisara and Basara. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas says that both Kisara and Basara are the ancestors of Giants, created by Gods after Dagruel&#39;s &quot;True Giants&quot;. Because they were born as twins, they were said to have quarreled over who was the older sister or the older brother, and their quarrel was so fierce that the damage was considerable at that time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas&#39; argument was that &#39;the source of all the disasters can be traced back to the god ancestors&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The situation was calmed down when Kisara and Basara fought with Dagruel, lost, and became his disciples.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It was not good that Dagruel&#39;s power expanded, as you say, &#39;You can conquer a poison with a poison. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that the situation has since changed to a power struggle with the Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The situation changed when Dagruel and Kisara got married. It is often said that having a family settles things down, and it seems that this was exactly the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the peaceful period lasted for a while, but it was only a period of preparation for the next war... peace and war were repeated every hundred years or so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I&#39;m not interested in that kind of history, so he explained it to me in rolls.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kisara, the wife of Dagruel, died in childbirth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Basara was very upset by the death of her twin sister, but I guess they must have been close enough to fight with each other. Well, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Basara was put under house arrest by Dagruel. Luminas says that he was forced to go to sleep, but he was almost certainly awakened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was also mentioned in the report from Ultima.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked him what was going on because there was a troublesome ruffian called &quot;Four Arms&quot; a long time ago, but it seems that he had been locked up for a long time. The old man said he would send them out if necessary. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I am almost sure that Ultima will appear as an enemy this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Ultima says that they are troublesome, they must be very serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The group led by Basara is called the &quot;Five Great Generals&quot;, which is decided by the annual competition to test their skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, since the average lifespan of Giants is about 500 years, it seems that they are selected only from the ancient giants who have a lifespan of more than 1,000 years - senior fighters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is said that young giants sometimes reincarnate their ancestors, and this is an annual event to promote national prestige in Damargania.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the five great generals are the best of the five, but they are not as big a threat as Basara, the leader of the five. They are definitely lower in rank than the Beastketeers and the two twin-winged men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, the Seven Nobles under Luminas are stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here is a summary of the forces of the two sides.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, on the Luminas side</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gunther and Louis are Million-class, and their existence value is a little more than a million.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Seven Nobles are equivalent to Demon Lord Seed, and their existence value is from 200,000 to 600,000. There seems to be an individual difference among them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, there were &quot;Seven Luminary Clerics&quot; as a front force, but they have been wiped out due to a sad incident. There was no time to replenish the champion class of the human race, and they will be reconstituted from the current Holy Knights in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that&#39;s about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next, on the Dagruel side</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord and Fenn, Dagruel&#39;s younger brothers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord&#39;s existence value is said to be less than 2 million, and Fenn&#39;s is even higher than Dagruel&#39;s. They seem to be ridiculously strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Basara, whom I mentioned earlier, is a little less than Glassord, but just over a million. It seems that he is almost equal to Gunther and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The values of the five remaining generals are said to be between 150,000 and 300,000. The threat level is not as high as that of the current Beastketeers, but the problem is that there are other senior fighters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The total number of fighters is close to a hundred, but the minimum existence value is over 100,000, and the maximum is said to be close to 150,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is not surprising since there is a turnover in the competition every year. However, the fact that there were nearly a hundred such strong participants was a threat that could not be ignored.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I believe that quality is better than quantity, but it would be troublesome if the number of participants exceeds the minimum. It would be easier if we could make them wear a suit of armor like Velgrynd-san, but I don&#39;t think Dagruel would allow us to do so... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve felt threatened by numbers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, we&#39;ve been at loggerheads with him for a long time, but I (Ruminas voice) knew that I (Ruminas voice) would be at a disadvantage in a full-scale war. We had prepared accordingly, but our forces were greatly reduced by some slime. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hey, hey! That&#39;s a story that&#39;s already been told!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and so on, but it did not lead to the solution of the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We had no choice but to send reinforcements from Tempest, but then Shion joined the conversation with a big smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel is nothing to be afraid of!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion stands up. Then he called out to the other side of the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Come on in, you guys! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The men who were called by Shion entered the room looking nervous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who are these guys? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s been a while! I&#39;m Dagura!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m Leura. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m Debra!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I left them with Shion and forgot that they were Dagruel&#39;s sons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I had actually had them in the back of my mind, but I had no idea what to do with them since they had suddenly turned hostile to Dagruel... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, it&#39;s been a while. I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re doing well, but I wonder if you guys know what&#39;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they want to go back to Dagruel, we should send them away without taking them prisoner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frankly speaking, each of them is stronger than a bad Demon Lord Seed, so it would be troublesome for them to become an asset of the enemy... but if we take them captive, we will have to devote our forces to guard them, which may cause unnecessary confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Killing an unarmed opponent is out of the question, and we don&#39;t have any other good ideas. There is also a possibility of Isolation in Ramiris&#39; labyrinth, but it would increase the burden on Ramiris&#39; group, so it was safer not to do that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I waited for the answers from the three of them while thinking like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, I received an unexpected answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course. My father has switched sides, and I am very embarrassed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We had heard about Fenn&#39;s uncle in our bedtime stories, but we never thought he would come back in this day and age. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Heh heh heh, he was diabolical and I heard he and my father were evenly matched.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, he was speaking from our point of view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I decided to ask him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, you&#39;re going to war with your father, are you going to be okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I think so. I&#39;m worried, but I&#39;m more interested in testing how strong we are now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are right. We are being trained day by day by Shion-sama. Mental and physical training and good food. And we even have friends to compete with. Defeating those who try to destroy this environment is the reason we&#39;ve got the power we have!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Woah woah, we&#39;re all rather happy to be able to show off the results of our training. I&#39;m going to use my power too and beat your uncles to a pulp!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they said to each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They seemed to really mean it and were ready to fight against Dagruel and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I looked at Shion, he nodded his head in satisfaction, as if it was a matter of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, what should we do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it really okay to send these three men off to war?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I </span><span class="c3">don&#39;t think it will be a problem</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san answered without a pause as I was wondering what to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what about the possibility of their betrayal?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I believe their words are true, but if they are fake, it will put our allies in danger. Some of the others would have been reluctant to fight with the sons of the enemy general.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Ciel-san&#39;s attitude remained firm.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I </span><span class="c3">think it is highly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;unlikely. </span><span class="c3">Because-&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did not need to hear his answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door to the room opened and Shion&#39;s men rushed in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of them, a big-looking older brother, was the first to address his opinion to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rimuru-sama, we believe you and Doug!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hey, Gobzo...?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mistook him for Gobzo because of his fearless look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His face is the same, but his spirit is different. And his words were that he believed in Dagura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobzo is not the only one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s &quot;Yomigaeri&quot; began to speak out in defense of the Daguras.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was proof that they truly believed in them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or perhaps they thought I was going to dispose of or even lock up Dagura and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sorry to hear that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m a rational thinker, but I wouldn&#39;t take their lives out of the blue just because I&#39;m worried that they might become my enemies... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rimuru-sama! Thus, our unity is solid. We are not trained to be soft... so we will not be moved by a slightest thing...!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion himself, perhaps feeling his responsibility as the one in charge of Dagruel&#39;s sons, looked me straight in the eye and advised me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was enough for me, but then Luminas made a surprising comment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rimuru, to tell you the truth, even I (Ruminas voice) have a feeling that I want to get rid of Dagruel&#39;s sons. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was about to say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t have such a feeling...&quot; but Luminas continued before I could say anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I think we can trust them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a self-proclaimed close friend of Dagruel, but he was defending Dagruel&#39;s position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked him in detail how he came to this conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas told me with a bitter look on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shion&#39;s cooking has improved, but only with their help. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I beg your pardon?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who do you think tasted it? I (Ruminas voice) didn&#39;t like it but there are curious people everywhere. One of the Seven Lords foolishly came forward and had to spend a month in bed.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought that the undead would be safe from death, but he was wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought he was an idiot, but I hesitated to tell him. After all, it is always those challengers who bring about wonderful inventions and discoveries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think it is amazing that the first person ate sea urchin or sea cucumber. I heard that they were forced to eat such ghettos, and that there were some punishments, but I think that their actions contributed tremendously to the later gastronomy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that sense, I would say that the aristocrat was rather courageous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I nodded lightly and urged Luminas to continue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;After that, no one wanted to taste the food, but they came forward. Everyone was so moved by their generosity that I (Ruminas voice) was forced to admit them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that behind Shion&#39;s culinary progress lies a story of unimaginable hardship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Adalmann or someone like him left a famous quote, &quot;I never thought I would be thankful for not being able to eat.&quot; Indeed, he thanked everyone from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, when we get to eat Miss Adalmann&#39;s home-cooked meals, we are the ones who deserve this role, aren&#39;t we? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re right, brother. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A reward!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe these three are just crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But all&#39;s well that ends well, and as long as Dagura and the others are not in a state of dissonance, they are welcome to join us in our efforts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well then, let&#39;s say that Luminas and I will deal with Dagruel, and leave Fenn to Shion and the others. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph! I (Ruminas voice) will deal with Dagruel. To be honest, it&#39;s a bit tough, but it&#39;s easy enough to buy time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Luminas&#39; point of view, he did not seem to think that he could beat Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Strategically speaking, while Luminas was holding Dagruel down, he would defeat the other leaders of the enemy, and then they would all challenge him for the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, if I was Fenn&#39;s opponent, we would have more time to spare in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Okay, then...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s when I said to myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was about to say, &quot;I think I see a way to win,&quot; the situation suddenly became urgent.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The news came via an urgent Telepathy Net from Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Hey Rimuru, I&#39;m in trouble!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;You know, you&#39;re always talking about how hard things are, but I&#39;m going through a lot, too, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to let it go lightly, but this time it was really hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to let it go lightly, but this time it was really hard. Listen, I&#39;ve lost contact with Milim&#39;s office. I ordered them to investigate immediately, but I have a bad feeling about this ! &#39; Ramiris said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just a few minutes ago, Gobta and the others returned and reported that they had succeeded in defeating Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the problem happened right after that. Suddenly, the video monitoring the war situation stopped working.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fortunately, the &quot;portal&quot; remained connected to the site.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta and his team had to go back to the site to investigate and Ramiris contacted me at Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;This is bad,&#39; he said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told you so!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, this is what I call having no time to calm down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t think Milim has anything to do with this, but I do have an idea about the video interference.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39; </span><span class="c3">s Velzard, isn&#39;t it?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san agrees with me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then we can be almost sure that it is Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tell Gobta and the others to take it easy. I&#39;ll be back soon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told Ramiris and ended the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I turn to Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sorry. There&#39;s an emergency. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I think Milim and Velzard-san got into a fight. I&#39;ve got to call Guy and I&#39;m going to head back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Okay. We&#39;ll be ready for Dagruel, don&#39;t worry. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s right! Let&#39;s see if we can defeat the Titans by ourselves!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To allay my fears, Luminas tells me it&#39;s going to be okay. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And even Shion assured me that we would be fine on our own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t take his word for it, but I could trust him for a little while until we could figure out what to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I&#39;m going back.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of it!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, I remember now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should tell you this, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas, just so you know, don&#39;t be too sure about the four-day window. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The earliest the Dagruel forces can expect to reach the island is four days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that is only if they maintain their current speed of march.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There might be someone like me who can shift the whole army, so we need to be careful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm, you&#39;re right. I (Ruminas voice) have considered this possibility. You can do it, you know. It would be negligent of a commander to think that the enemy can&#39;t do what we can do. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, he understood me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I have nothing more to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll take care of the important ones first, since I can rush to your aid if the need arises.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Take care. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas and I nodded at each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good luck, Rimuru-sama!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that kind of push from Shion and the others, I returned to Tempest.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.qsh70q"></a><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon my return, I quickly made my way to the Control Room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, I was shocked at what I saw.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tasteless... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very, very bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the big screen, we saw Milim, who was so furious that he had lost his reason, transformed into a deformed form and went on a rampage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His opponent was Velzard. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is a bewitching beauty with a smiling face, but she is not backing away from Milim, who has turned into a &quot;real destroyer&quot;, and they are fighting each other evenly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was truly the battle of the gods all over again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris answered without a pause.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gobta is filming us!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, that&#39;s not what I wanted to ask... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m asking you what&#39;s going on!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, that. As you can see, it sucks!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, now I understand why Ramiris is completely useless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Benimaru who stood up from his luxurious commander&#39;s seat to greet me as I let out a sigh of exasperation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We were all excited about our success in defeating Zelanus, but suddenly we lost contact with him. I sent Gobta, who had just returned, to scout the area. There, it was confirmed that Velzard-sama and Milim-sama were in a state of battle.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru told us the story to the point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most interesting thing about the situation in the area is that there are no known survivors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battlefield was completely covered with white ice, and there were no signs of life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga, who was with Gobta, has been trying to collect some kind of scent particles by &#39;wind manipulation&#39; to help us understand the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As it turned out, all the smells had disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, although we could see the ice sculptures from the visual information, we could assume that the whole battlefield was in the same situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I would have liked to check out the ice sculptures, but it seems that even Gobta, who is protected by Ranga, had difficulty, or rather impossibility, in getting close to them.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it that bad?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is it that bad?&quot; &quot;Yes. This video was also shot from the maximum possible distance. Gobta was whining about it, but I&#39;m trying to get him to be patient. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think Benimaru is not only a devil at heart but a real devil, but I don&#39;t think this is the time to talk so lightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera and his men are still there, but they can&#39;t communicate with me on the &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; either. We are connected by the Soul Corridor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone on the battlefield is dead or alive. This is, indeed, the worst thing that could happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want to think that Carrera and the others were dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, Karion and Frey-san must have been there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was unthinkable that there were so many Million-class members who could not do anything and were wiped out in a short period of time. If there was some emergency, we had agreed to stall for time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, here we are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it was not clear from the video, Milim seemed to have gone out of control. He seemed to unleash a level of power that was beyond normal, and was having a big fight with Velzard... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wondered what could have caused that... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t get the bad imagery out of my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But being stuck in it does not solve anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s no wonder Ramiris is completely out of his mind, but I can&#39;t let that happen to me either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battlefield must be a hell of a mess. I made up my mind and changed my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What do we do now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no point in panicking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a situation, we should think about what we can do now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keep your mind calm and collected. You must think of countermeasures one by one, and deal with them one by one, starting with what you can do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;All the remaining Dungeon&#39;s Elite Ten are summoned. It will be too dangerous to go any further, so let Gobta and the others return as well. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, sir... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t think the battle between Milim and Velzard-san will be so easily settled. I think the only ones who can take on Milim in his runaway state are me and Veldora, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, I don&#39;t like it either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, if Milim really gets out of control, who can stop him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard that Ramiris interceded in a clash with Guy a long time ago...but I can&#39;t expect much from Ramiris now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, hoping for the near-zero chance that Ramiris might have interceded...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, Ramiris...just a question...can you bring Milim back to his senses while I hold Velzard-san back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! Are you asking me to die ? &quot;Hey! Are you telling me to die? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knew it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought this solution was impossible, and I didn&#39;t expect it from the beginning, but now I have proof.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Ramiris, who is now a little boy, could not take it from the ground up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, I thought it would be impossible. But I didn&#39;t think you would come with a plan to make Milim go berserk...&quot; he muttered, sighing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He mutters and lets out a sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Benimaru and the others are busy gathering the executives, we have to think about our next move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, I had not expected this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is bad enough to have a traitor among our own people, but to have an even worse calamity waiting for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I knew it was an effective means, but I didn&#39;t expect it to be this way... </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;... </span><span class="c3">If Milim really goes out of control, the world may collapse. This is a forbidden measure that does not involve friend or foe, and if he is prepared to do this without a fight, we need to be prepared for a more serious situation</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what does that mean?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Unleashing the </span><span class="c3">World-destroying Dragon Ivarage is the most likely candidate, but we should also be on the lookout for other dangerous measures</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, anything goes, no rules.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s really bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How to bring Milim back to his senses when he&#39;s out of control is a problem, and now he has Velzard-san to interfere with that. I thought of asking Veldora for help, but when Velzard-san&#39;s image appeared in the video, he became suspicious and ran away, saying he remembered something he had to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&#39;s so unreliable at the critical moment, isn&#39;t she? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I can&#39;t complain about it since it&#39;s the same for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I could escape, I would run away as fast as I can.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&#39;s not an exaggeration... it means the end of mankind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, I&#39;m troubled by it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if I&#39;m the only one who survives, it doesn&#39;t mean anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was better to resist with all my might than to tolerate such a future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s time to stop whining.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have switched my mind to think seriously about countermeasures from now on.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before the executives gather, I have one more thing to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is, to summon some powerful helpers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I&#39;m calling for your immediate support. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy-sama didn&#39;t seem to be interested, but let me, Raine, do the negotiating here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, it was Guy whom I was trying to call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To tell the truth, no matter how hard I try, it&#39;s impossible for me to deal with Velzard and Milim at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t win a war with mentality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was not going to enter into a fight that I could not win, and if I had no choice but to do it, I would not spare any effort to improve my chances of winning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I tried to connect &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; to Guy, but was rejected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did he get tired of it, sensing the battle between Velzard and Milim?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I don&#39;t think so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, unlike Veldora, knows what he has to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, he thinks that there is a more serious threat than this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that Ciel-san and Guy came to the same conclusion depresses me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problems are piling up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if I involve Guy, I can deal with Velzard-san, but Milim will inevitably be with me. Even though I could see the way to that point, I had no plan beyond that point, which was the cause of my uneasiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can manage just to fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not sure if I can deal with Milim without affecting this planet, let alone the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Probably, it is all I can do not to die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, even if I die, I can come back as long as Veldora is around, but if I retire, Guy&#39;s burden will increase and he will be out of the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how strong Guy is, it is impossible for him to play against both of them at the same time. In the first place, the star itself will be destroyed if Guy doesn&#39;t play well against them... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to this, Feldway, Ivarage, and so on... It was just too much of a challenge one after another, even though we had defeated Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, even if I really try to think of a countermeasure, my mind is filled with unpleasant imaginations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While I was thinking like this, I received a reply from Raine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Rimuru-sama, it&#39;s perfect! Guy-sama is willing to do what I&#39;m asking...&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Hey, Rimuru, why are you using my Raine as your errand boy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What ?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, it was Guy who interrupted the &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; from Raine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t seem to understand why Raine and I were getting along so well, but of course there was a reason for this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had recognized Raine&#39;s talent as a painter and had started to ask her to do various things for my personal use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raine has responded to my requests with great pleasure, and now he has established a position that he is my personal painter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More specifically, I became Pat Long and helped Raine&#39;s talent to flourish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As to how we came to this relationship, it was after the meeting at Leon&#39;s castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the meeting at Leon&#39;s castle, I showed him the paintings that I had confiscated from Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The paintings that Raine had done were very beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like a photograph... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raine&#39;s paintings had various expressions without a model, just by spreading the wings of imagination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Among them, yes!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were nudes, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for me, I am naturally interested in them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From an artistic point of view, of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pursuit of beauty has no limits, and my desire for it knows no bounds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have no guilty feelings at all, but just out of intellectual curiosity as a person who pursues &quot;beauty&quot;, I just had to ask you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raine, can you draw a nude without a model? I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raine replied to my genuine question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s expensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not whether you can do it or not, but how expensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gently, I held out the bag of gold coins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raine quickly tucked it into his pocket without moving an eyebrow. Then, without losing his calm attitude, he said, &quot;Gold coins for the devil is nonsense. But I respect Rimuru-sama...&quot; He said something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the beginning of a high level of psychological warfare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I just asked him, &quot;What do you want?&quot; I asked him.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&quot;...it wasn&#39;t advanced at all, and it wasn&#39;t even sort of,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you know. It was </span><span class="c3">more of a direct...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, ignoring the outside intrusion, Raine&#39;s answer was as follows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m interested in points,&quot; she appealed to me, looking at me with pure eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From there, it was easy to win him over, let&#39;s say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had a lot of personal meetings with Raine. I became her patrong and supported her artistic activities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Ciel-san had done the brain preservation, I might not have felt so much enthusiasm. However, since he has been uncooperative at the critical moment, I have found a way of life in Raine&#39;s paintings.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;... </span><span class="c12">tch.</span><span class="c0">..&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought I heard something like a clap of tongue, but... no, no, it must have been my imagination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m a little tired, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I don&#39;t have any guilty conscience.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39; </span><span class="c3">t understand why so many of them have nudity as a motif...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t like it, Ciel-san .</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s nothing in this world that Ciel-san doesn&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So maybe it&#39;s just my imagination!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s the end of this story !</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the relationship between Raine and me has become a close one, and now she is working with me as an outside collaborator, doing whatever I want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is natural for Guy to be suspicious, but I don&#39;t owe him any explanations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I replied to him with a proud smile, &#39;This is not the time for this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not the time for this! It&#39;s an emergency, so come here right now! ASAP !! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, I ended my &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; with Guy.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The painting I have asked Raine to do on Hinata&#39;s model is not finished yet. I can&#39;t allow this world to be destroyed before I see it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once again, I vowed to myself that I would overcome this crisis at any cost.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Within five minutes of my command to Benimaru, we are all here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru is in command, and he is a proud commander.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta, who had just been recalled from scouting because of the danger, was shivering in his seat. He could have rested, but he has a strong sense of responsibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Ranga had already retreated into my shadow. I think he is cute in that way, even though he is a cheater. I hope he will take a good rest after the hardship he has suffered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Geld is in the emergency room with serious injuries. Although he is no longer seriously injured, he is so worn out that the recovery medicine cannot keep up with his condition, so he is taken to a rarely used recreation facility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil, who was accompanying Geld, was also hospitalized urgently by Shuna&#39;s decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gabil, who was accompanying Geld, was also hospitalized urgently by Shuna&#39;s decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The unexpected pitfall of the recovery medicine is that it makes them look healthy because they are not injured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To a monster, magicule is equivalent to life force. If it is exhausted, the monster may lose its life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For me, it is not a funny story, because I have been in such a situation many times in Naming. I had to force Gabil, who was going to attend the meeting, to take a rest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was another seriously injured person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo brought him to the medical facility, and he is in stable condition. Shuna reported that he would wake up soon. As one would expect from a former hero and a current demon lord, the recovery rate of his physical strength seems to be quite fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope he will join the meeting when he wakes up, but I can&#39;t force him to do so. Since we cannot afford to wait for Leon&#39;s recovery, unfortunately, he did not participate in the meeting this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of the labyrinthine group is Kumara, Zegion, and Apito.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann&#39;s group participated in the defense of Lubelius with Shion, and Gadra (Master) also joined them. Since the Dragon King team does not participate in such cases, all of them are here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Hakurou is continuing his training as a guard for the children. Sare and Grigori also remained in training.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sare seems to be one of the best, while Grigori seems to be in a good competition with the children.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason why Hakurou was not invited was so as not to worry the children.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chloe had come to my rescue under the false pretense of being sick, but now she is really down. That&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;m trying not to make Kenya and the others feel uneasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, I&#39;ve placed them in a safe hierarchy so that they can be safe even if enemies invade the labyrinth, but even so, I can&#39;t take any chances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that sense, Kumara is going to join the children as soon as I finish my message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there is another reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Momiji and Alvis have taken refuge in this labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kaede had also come to the labyrinth to accompany them. She has experience in childbirth and knows pregnant women very well, so she is a perfect person for the job. She is a perfect person for the job. She is here so that Benimaru can concentrate on the battle, and at Kaede&#39;s strong request, Hakurou has been assigned to guard Benimaru&#39;s wives to ensure their safety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we have all the members now, but I feel uneasy when there are so few of us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s no wonder they are scattered all over the place, but with Carrera&#39;s safety still unknown, it&#39;s only natural that we feel a sense of crisis like never before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, I have to swallow such anxieties and behave myself with dignity like Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We decided to start a discussion in the conference room adjacent to the &quot;Control Room&quot; so that we would be notified immediately if something happened, while keeping a watchful eye on the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m going to make a plan on my own, since this is not the time for a leisurely meeting. Unfortunately, the battle is still raging and the ground is shaking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Probably, there are earthquakes in the Kingdom of Ingracia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this continues, it will cause damage not only on a continental scale but also on a planetary scale. In order to prevent this from happening, I was going to ask for forgiveness for my selfishness this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conclusion I came up with was a haphazard, haphazard, no-plan, and reckless plan that Guy and I would go out and do something about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But since even Ciel-san, my reliable partner, couldn&#39;t find a great plan, I had no choice but to give up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you all for coming. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He greeted the participants, and then he suddenly got down to the main topic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to deal with Milim. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I announced this, the place became tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course. It&#39;s a bad idea for generals to make a move on their own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a common thing in our case, but it&#39;s still unusual for us to skip even a discussion like this, so everyone must be thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kufufufu, then, let me join Rimuru-sama. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo offered to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, you are strong, but you can&#39;t take it easy on Milim, can you? I&#39;m sure there will be a more suitable opponent. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-He refused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter what anyone says, this is a decision. If we were going to fight against Milim or Velzard, we would only be taking more casualties even if we hit a large number of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...If we are going to fight </span><span class="c3">against that level of fighters, there is no one we can count as our strength,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot; said Ciel-san, who also agreed.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san agreed with this statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san assured that even Benimaru, Zegion, and Diablo would be useless. He said that there was a very high risk of casualties, although it was only a possibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they are going to kill Milim, but not if they are going to stop him, it is possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that case, I have no choice but to do my best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, I call out to Guy who came all the way here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I need Guy&#39;s company. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...Oh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy stared at me, but I was not intimidated by that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compared to going to the dangerous mediation alone, it was much better to convince Guy here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;After all, Guy-san is the leader of the eight stars, right? As a newcomer, I thought I had no choice but to ask my senior members who I can rely on to go to the meeting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan was to encourage Guy and get him involved. It seems to increase the probability of success, and I hope he will forgive me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, however, interrupted me with a grim look on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You called me up and now you want me to help you? You&#39;ve got some nerve, you know that?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, no, no, I&#39;m a chicken, that&#39;s why I want Guy to help me. No kidding, please be serious.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here, I bowed my head and asked him to help me so that he would know how I really felt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this, Guy&#39;s attitude changes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he started to talk to me in a serious tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you understand? I understand that you are worried about Milim and the others, but...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy seemed to have come to the same conclusion as Ciel-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather than mediating the battle between Milim and Velzard, Guy seems to have come to the same conclusion as Ciel-san. The more I think about it, the more depressing it becomes, but I can&#39;t shake the conclusion that we should do what we can for now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are talking about the possibility of Ivarage being unleashed? I&#39;m worried about that, too, but if this world is destroyed before that happens, it&#39;s over anyway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said this to Guy, trying not to be intimidated by him and showing my resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You noticed that?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy said in an amused tone and sat down silently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seemed to have decided to wait for my reaction for the time being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I take advantage of this and proceed with my story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Actually, I don&#39;t know what Velzard is trying to do. I don&#39;t think that his intention to make Milim really angry was to cause a runaway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What does Velzard want us to do after the runaway is a means to an end?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we know that, we might be able to do something about it... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now is not the time to dwell on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To save Carrera and the others, we must put it behind us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was thinking about this, Guy muttered something to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe Velzard wants to see me in action.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;His wish has never changed. He wants to prove he&#39;s better than me in a real fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at Guy wondering what he was going to say all of a sudden, but he looked very serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apparently, he meant what he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy looked uncomfortable, saying, &quot;That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t believe that the world is about to be destroyed by such a lover&#39;s quarrel... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was disgusted, but I couldn&#39;t leave it at that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Even if it&#39;s true, the planet will be shattered if they keep fighting. We have to stop them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They want us here, don&#39;t they? If we don&#39;t, Feldway&#39;s plan will fail, and isn&#39;t that the best thing to do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy says that the planet is created by Veldanava&#39;s power and will not shatter. However, the power of Milim is still rising, and if the star is left unattended, it will be contaminated by the magicule.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, we should be glad that the star is not shattered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is natural to think that magic like Carrera&#39;s is not something that should be invoked on the planet. It is precisely because it was on this world that it was able to withstand such a drastic power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Otherwise, the earth&#39;s axis would have been distorted even if we were lucky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy&#39;s argument makes sense when he explains it like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we join in the war, it would be just as Feldway wanted, and we might end up calling Ivarage out. Guy&#39;s decision was right if he wanted to avoid such a risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, however.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I almost nodded my head, but that option was long gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Unfortunately, Carrera and the others have been turned into ice sculptures, too, and we can&#39;t just leave them there. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera is not the only one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we don&#39;t rescue Frey-san, Karion, and the others who fought there, we will never be able to live in a world where we can all laugh together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why my resolve is unshakable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn it! I get it! I&#39;ll go along with you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy said, and got up like that.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You know, if we get too serious, the area contaminated by magicule will increase. You have to be careful, okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s my line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;ve already done it once. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know! I can&#39;t help you this time, so don&#39;t do anything rash!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris said to me, &quot;I&#39;m worried about you alone,&quot; but I don&#39;t know what to think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then again, I&#39;m not qualified to be a big talker either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s kind of funny to me that I have no plan so far, but I can&#39;t help it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was time to be strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I&#39;ve been in the same situation many times before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, it&#39;s just me and Guy who are going to stop Milim. I would like you all to defend the base (here) and respond to requests for help from other countries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of you may be dissatisfied with the fact that we are only communicating a decision this time. However, this is the best solution that we have decided after consulting with Ciel-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rimuru-sama, I would still like to join you even if it is only me...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned down Diablo&#39;s proposal, unhesitatingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo seemed to be able to handle our fight. But I turned him down because I wanted him to stay behind in case of any unforeseen circumstances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It seems that Feldway&#39;s goal is not only to revive Ivarage. I think Dagruel&#39;s attack on Luminas is a diversion so that he can use our forces as a diversion. You, Benimaru, and Zegion are the only ones who can take care of me after I&#39;m stuck. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo is a good man, but that&#39;s why we want him to stay. Not only Feldway, but also the bug demon Lord Zelanus still remains... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as the labyrinth is safe, we will not be defeated in the true sense of the word. I felt uneasy if all three of us had to stay here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru had the important role of commanding the team.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zegion was trusted as the guardian of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s command and Zegion&#39;s strength, combined with the environment of the labyrinth, would surely be able to withstand an opponent like Zelanus. In addition, with Diablo&#39;s uncanny ability to respond, I was inclined to believe that they would be able to cope even if the enemy launched an all-out attack on the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, I forced the three of them to agree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Veldora.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who am I?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Veldora-san is really the last resort. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora seemed dissatisfied that I did not call her by name, but she nodded her head in satisfaction when she heard what I said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have to tell you again and again that if Veldora is safe, I can come back to life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t want to try it, but there is a big difference between having insurance and not having insurance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve shut down the opposition with my own prejudice, so I&#39;ve decided to go out as soon as I can.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The more time I take, the slower my decision will be, and I&#39;ll leave the rest to Veldora.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m counting on you, Veldora!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll leave it to you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing Veldora nodding her head, I felt very confident.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris jumped on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rimuru, take care of Milim!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of him!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To reassure the anxious Ramiris, I promised to bring Milim back to his senses with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope my voice will reach Milim, the strongest demon lord in the world, because no half measures will work against him. If I can control my anger, I will naturally come to my senses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, it is a matter of luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a prerequisite that Guy will be able to control Velzard. Then, we must be prepared for a long battle while making adjustments to minimize the impact on the planet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was an unprecedented recklessness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To begin with, facing Milim in a runaway state while holding back is a suicide mission... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I assured Diablo that it was impossible, but I wasn&#39;t so sure either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I have no choice but to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru, I&#39;ll take over. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t worry!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m glad Benimaru is here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We need to be ready for any request from other countries, especially Lubelius is under the war. We do not know what will happen. The situation is changing moment by moment, and we have to respond flexibly while distributing the remaining forces well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only Benimaru can be entrusted with such a difficult adjustment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded back at Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, let&#39;s see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Don&#39;t go on a rampage and cause more damage!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s wake Milim up before it&#39;s too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With everyone&#39;s anxious eyes on us and too much expectation on our shoulders, Guy and I left the place.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.3as4poj"></a><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Rimuru and Guy left, there was a heavy atmosphere in the meeting room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve never felt so helpless before,&quot; Diablo said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These words represented the sentiments of those who were present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s for sure. I was told that I had a major role to play in analyzing and directing the war situation, but even if I had to give up that role, I would have been happy to serve as Rimuru-sama&#39;s escort. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru also speaks honestly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He could not strongly oppose Rimuru&#39;s decision because he thought Rimuru&#39;s decision was right, but in truth, Rimuru was more important than his friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time was different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru, who is always so aloof, was quite nervous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seemed to hide it so as not to make everyone uneasy, but Benimaru, who has known him for a long time, could see it clearly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not happy about the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I didn&#39;t intend it that way, but I guess I&#39;m still spoiled by Rimuru-sama...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. If that&#39;s what Rimuru-sama wants, then I have no choice but to comply, but I&#39;m disappointed that he thought I couldn&#39;t take it easy on him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s not all. Feldway, Jahil, and Demon Lord Dagruel... there are many enemies to watch out for and we are not strong enough. That&#39;s why they decided it would be better to let you help us. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru had guessed Rimuru&#39;s thoughts almost correctly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had known each other for a long time. It was only natural that he should be able to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why he feels so disappointed in himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We can&#39;t just sit around moping. We just have to do what we are given to do, and do it honestly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zegion concludes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zegion also understands the importance of the labyrinth. That is why he warns them not to let unnecessary anxiety interfere with their original mission. Thus, Zegion and his group returned to their territory in order to be ready for any enemy to attack at any time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru laughed at Zegion&#39;s attitude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Zegion is right. Each one of you, keep your heads up for the mission!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He encouraged everyone to resume their work to fulfill the responsibilities of those who had been assigned to take over from Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris and her men are busy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is much to do. Busy work is a distraction from the anxiety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the meantime, the usual atmosphere returned to the Control Room... but the normalcy that had been restored faded away with Souei&#39;s return.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re back, Souei?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. Where&#39;s Rimuru-sama?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a serious situation. He&#39;s on his way to deal with it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Damn, I have to depend on you again... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru asked him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, you seem to be in a hurry, is something wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei instantly regained his composure and started to report.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I was investigating the movements of the people of Dagruel under the order of Rimuru-sama. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He prefaced his report by saying so, and then he described the results of his investigation in detail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Damargania, there was an underground city buried in the desert as a place of refuge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the once prosperous royal city was destroyed, the city abandoned the ground and developed a huge subterranean space around an underground lake, creating a living space that could support tens of thousands of people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women and children of the Giants seemed to be leading their lives as usual there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei saw that they were not affected by the changes in Dagruel. Relieved, he set out to investigate the cause of Dagruel&#39;s betrayal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei went to the royal palace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were only a few soldiers left, but the administrators were working as usual. They did not know about Dagruel&#39;s change of mind and treated Souei as an emissary from the allied countries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After listening to them, Souei was able to find the cause of this betrayal. He could not guarantee that he was right, but since he had no other information to go on, he decided to return to his report for the time being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see. So you&#39;re saying that the three brothers, including the sealed brother, were once a single Titan, an evil god rampaging around as the destroyer of the world. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s right. They reformed after their defeat by Veldanava-sama and became as calm as they are now after meeting Queen Kisara...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Myths are not to be taken for fools. We should consider that it is based on some truth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, I agree. Then... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We should be wary of the resurrection of the evil gods... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru and Souei nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who were listening to their conversation also looked at each other with serious expressions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, it may be true,&quot; said Benimaru. Dagruel is an incarnation of naturally occurring power, and he fought against Veldanava a long time ago. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Ramiris said something like that, which further increased the importance of the argument.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;By the way, how strong was this evil god?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru asked Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He was very strong. Not as strong as me, but stronger than my old master. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course, he is stronger than me now!&quot;&quot;Of course, he&#39;s stronger than me now! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ramiris hurriedly calms down Veldora, who is unhappy at being told that she is stronger than him. I don&#39;t know if he meant it or not, but at least everyone understood that the evil god is a threat equivalent to a &quot;True Dragon&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bad news may come in a string of bad news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The call came from Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re in trouble! I have just received an urgent message from my sister, no, Elmesia (Your Majesty), that Sarion has entered into a state of war!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">she shouted as she rushed into the &quot;Control Room&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru answered and asked him to tell us the details.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myourmiles answered that he had received a call through his cell phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are several ways to communicate between Tempest and the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty of Sarion, but Elmesia seems to have decided that a direct line would be the most reliable. Myourmiles also sensed this and rushed here while conversing with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myourmiles is out of breath, but gets to the point. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two who attacked Sarion were Zalario and Jahil. They led the main force to launch the assault, he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So it was not a diversion but a full-scale offensive?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, sir. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sarion has Silvia-dono, but it&#39;ll be tough... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru growled as he grasped the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia was indeed strong. Even if Benimaru were to fight her, it would be a pretty good match.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Silvia&#39;s opponent was Jahil, whom even Benimaru had a hard time against.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although there is a certain affinity in a battle, Silvia alone would not be able to do it when there is Zalario, a strong opponent, in addition to Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Argus&quot;, the surveillance spell, has been successfully switched. Local video, it&#39;s coming up!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alpha tactfully shows the situation in Sarion on the big screen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There, trees towering from the god&#39;s generation are shown, towering over the huge city. This is the pride of Sarion, the divine tree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here and there, flashes of light twinkled on its trunk and branches.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The flashes were as small and ephemeral as sparklers in the video, but there was no doubt that they were huge explosions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Jahil&#39;s fire. This must be serious.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do we do, Benimaru?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei asked Benimaru, and Benimaru looked anguished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we don&#39;t send our forces here, Sarion will fall. However, there is no one who can be sent out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A half-hearted force would be nothing more than a drop in the bucket, and if they were to send a force, they had to generate a force that would ensure victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the labyrinth, they could carry out suicide missions without worrying about death. Even if they could not win the war, they could easily stall for time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, when it comes to dispatch... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to go.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru, Diablo, and Zegion. Even these three are not certain against Jahil and his men. With the others, it would be like going to die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shall I go?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo offered, but Benimaru refused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not sure, but he had a bad feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, I fought Jahil once. I was no match for him then, but I have a chance now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was training hard in the labyrinth to review his abilities. Although there was no visible change in the amount of magicule, his ability had certainly improved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, there was no guarantee that he could win against Jahil, but in order to dispel everyone&#39;s fears, he confidently and boldly showed his confidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmmm...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo also refrained from refuting Benimaru&#39;s argument, taking Benimaru&#39;s intention into consideration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While expressing his gratitude to Diablo, Benimaru continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Besides, if this is a diversion, it would be dangerous to further devote our defenses to the main labyrinth. My intuition is telling me that it&#39;s better for you to stay here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see. If Benimaru-dono says so, I will obey him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru is the man who has been assigned by Rimuru to take his place. In terms of the chain of command, he was above Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I understand it, I do not intend to disobey him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo decided to tell him what he thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;-But, Zalario is strong, isn&#39;t he?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s Jahil that Benimaru is wary of, but Diablo thinks Zalario is more of a nuisance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The man is a true warrior. He has a lot of skill (level), not to mention a lot of magicule. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s decision did not waver even though he was told so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, he was thinking about it, but he swallowed it down without showing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m leaving. It&#39;s decided.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh, are you copying Rimuru-sama? But how are you going to lead?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We can do that from the road.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru assured him so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is aware that this is quite reckless, but he still intends to push through with his opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora calls out to Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Benimaru, have you forgotten yourself? I can beat even a small thing like Jahil or Zalario with a single twist, can&#39;t I?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora&#39;s confident statement again shook Benimaru&#39;s resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that Rimuru has defeated Michael, Feldway has less reason to target Veldora. Knowledge as a commander appealed to him to make the best use of his forces rather than to keep them at maximum strength deep in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, however, Benimaru&#39;s instinct, what might be called a wild intuition, was telling him that this was a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, Benimaru denied it immediately without any sign of agitation on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It is true that Veldora-sama is not an enemy of Jahil. But...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But...&quot; &quot;Hmm? What is your concern?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When asked this question, Benimaru laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have a lot of concerns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the reason why he could not dispatch Veldora, the largest force against Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What I am worried about is the evil god you mentioned earlier. I heard that even Demon Lord Dagruel was Veldora-sama&#39;s quarreling friend. In addition, there is a giant named Fenn, Dagruel&#39;s younger brother who is said to have been sealed up in ancient times. They were almost evenly matched, weren&#39;t they?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo nodded at Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I didn&#39;t see them fight, but from a distance I felt that Fenn was the better fighter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see. Ultima reported it, so it must be a threat. If that&#39;s the case. Even with the presence of Demon Lord Luminas, I doubt if Shion and Adalmann and the others will be able to win the battle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel and Fenn, we should assume that both of them are comparable to the True Dragon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, Glassord is also a presence that should not be ignored. Since it is said that he was fighting against Demon Lord Leon, it was considered to be a challenge just to defeat him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, the Titans have some strongmen in their ranks that we have not seen yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under such circumstances, if the evil god were to resurface... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is all just a possibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Benimaru could not shake off his anxiety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But there is still time before they reach Lubelius, right? If I go there and finish the job quickly...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, that&#39;s just wishful thinking. Just as Rimuru-sama has a secret technique to transfer the army, we should be assured that the enemy can do the same. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru had also advised us to think of it as a profitable strategy if we could buy time. Benimaru agrees with this opinion, and we should never let our guard down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru felt a tingling sensation on his neck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was instinct telling him to be on the lookout for danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Lubelius was almost certain, though he had no proof, that something was going to happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Therefore, I hope that Veldora-sama will be prepared for any emergency.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru always said that Veldora was a secret weapon, and Benimaru felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is always better to play your trump card until the last moment. When you are in a situation where you have to cut the trump card, it is as if you have proved that the worst has happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if the unexpected happened, it would mean the defeat of their own camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Very well. I&#39;ll be with you, so you go out there and play your part!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kufufufu, Benimaru-dono has come himself. Leave this to me. But please take command. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo also agreed to send Benimaru out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Benimaru&#39;s departure was decided.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru is going to take several other people with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil and Zalario were confirmed, but there was a possibility that other strongmen might appear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a situation, the defender is at a disadvantage. In such a situation, the defenders are at a disadvantage because they have to be prepared to deal with whatever force comes at them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m coming with you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei was the first to come forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru did not object to this and readily agreed to go with Souei.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei&#39;s ability was ideal for playing with the enemy. He would be able to apply his skills more effectively than his numerical strength, and thus, he would be able to achieve great results in the war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then came the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kurenai was too exhausted to take with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same goes for Gobta and Ranga.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranga, who had been moved from Rimuru&#39;s shadow to Gobta&#39;s shadow, was also in a deep sleep to recover his lost strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gobta is relatively healthy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Can&#39;t we just take Gobta with us?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t want to die yet!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, we all agreed that we would not participate in the meeting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a plan to ask the labyrinthine members to join us, but Benimaru rejected the idea, saying that it would be better to have them play an active role in the labyrinth than to take them out to an unfamiliar place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this situation, we had no choice but to participate in the battle with only the two of us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, it can&#39;t be helped. Well, if Souei and I are compatible, we won&#39;t die at worst. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s right. We have Silvia-dono and Elmesia (Your Majesty). If we cooperate well, we can have a good fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei agrees with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The video surveillance of Sarion also showed Elmesia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My sister, you can fight - I mean, I was surprised at how strong you are...&quot; said Myourmiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Myourmiles said, and in fact, everyone was surprised and accepted the fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia and Elmesia are almost indistinguishable from each other, and surprisingly, their fighting abilities are not so different. The only difference is that Silvia uses &quot;lightning&quot; and Elmesia &quot;wind&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, it was a happy miscalculation for Benimaru and his team to find out that they had an unexpected force on their side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This has slightly increased their chances of winning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, Benimaru and his group were not pessimistic and decided to set out alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beta, who was checking the images of the various locations, shouted in a stifled voice</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Urgent report! Milim-sama and Velzard-sama have started to move. If they continue in that direction, they will hit the sacred tree protecting Sarion!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, all eyes focused on the big screen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The red dots on the screen were Milim and the blue ones were Velzard. They were moving at a frightening speed as if they were intertwined with each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beta was right, they would reach Sarion at this rate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s going on? Did Rimuru and the others do something?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora questioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no one answered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If we get caught in a battle like that, we will burn any place to ashes,&quot; Benimaru said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru muttered to himself in a pallid voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe that&#39;s what Feldway is trying to do.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the former Eurazania, the Velzard blizzard had frozen everything to ice. As a result, fortunately or unfortunately, the damage itself has been kept to a minimum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is meaningless if Velzard does not lift the ice, but still, there is still hope because it is not completely lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is not necessarily the same in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any city would be vaporized in an instant by a direct hit from Milim, which has lost its rationality... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is not only Sarion that is in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you going to let Milim-sama destroy the world?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I can&#39;t say for sure, but I think it&#39;s a possibility because he&#39;s crazy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo answered Benimaru&#39;s question without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Feldway&#39;s aim was really to spread death and destruction, it was thought that he was trying to summon Ivarage by using this as a trigger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Diablo pointed out this possibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru also thought it was possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Diablo thought it was crazy, it must be very dangerous. If he was such a person, I had no idea what he was thinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Either way, Sarion would disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where will they target after that? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Western Nations or El Dorado?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a possibility that they would pass through all the cities and come to the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We did not have enough information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, there was no answer to the question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This is not the time for idle talk,&quot; Benimaru said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru stood up with these words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru is also there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Diablo&#39;s guess is right, they would be trying hard to stop it by now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, Benimaru should have taken action instead of worrying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru does not dislike guts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has an overconfident side and thinks that he can make it if he tries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it was only for himself, and it was against his principle to involve others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Souei. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was all they needed to say to each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was enough for him to make up his mind and go out to the place where he would die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll go with you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-Demon Lord Leon, who had been there for some time, came out of the sickroom and announced that he was going to join the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will go with you. I have an unspeakable grudge against Jahil. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Kagali came to the &quot;Control Room&quot; with a look of determination that she would not give in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behind her was Teare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We have to beat that son of a bitch and free Footman! I&#39;ll do my best for that!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He declared with tears in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru had no reason to refuse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will not hesitate. I will accept your offer gratefully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the face was decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, the missing piece of the puzzle was found.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even after Benimaru and the others have left, the &quot;Control Room&quot; remains in a flurry of activity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Information is gathered from all over the world and delivered to Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t want anything more to happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the common wish of all the busy workers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone was praying for everyone&#39;s safe return.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even this modest hope is dashed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Urgent message from Adalmann-sama ! They&#39;ve encountered an army of giants at the long wall in the desert!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the moment when Benimaru&#39;s prediction of danger came true in the worst possible way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A great battle has begun.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.1pxezwc"></a><a id="id.49x2ik5"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-010.png" src="images/image34.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.2p2csry"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the boundary between the barren land and the Western Nations is a long structure called the Long Wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is said that the small states within this wall were built by the work of the god Luminas to protect their civilizations from the hot sand, also known as the Deadly Desert.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This long wall is considered sacred because it is protected by a special &#39;Barrier&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the &#39;Anti-Monster Intrusion Barrier&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the name suggests, its purpose is to prevent the invasion of monsters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is common knowledge to those living in the frontier that the human sphere of existence is protected by this &#39;Barrier&#39;. The &#39;Barrier&#39; is activated to protect the long wall, blocking the invasion of monsters from the Deadly Desert.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The principle was simple: it was intended to block the accumulation of magicules and to prevent the formation of huge monsters. At the same time, it had the property of repelling magicules, so that more powerful monsters would not be attracted to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, it is not a universal phenomenon, and monsters sometimes invade through the frayed edges of the wards. However, since there are desert people who hunt them for a living, this has not been a major problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This long wall is considered to be the front line of the battle against monsters, and is included in the patrol route by the Holy Knight Order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through these regular patrols, the breakdown of the wards has been found and repaired. The work also included defeating invading monsters, thus protecting the lives of the people on the frontier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These facts have been accumulated, and the belief in the god Luminas has been enhanced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, the myth of the safety of the long wall was also unshakable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Today, after 2,000 years, the longwall is revealed in its true form.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the top of the long wall, there is a skeleton wearing sacred vestments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is Adalmann.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few moments ago, a distortion of space was detected. Immediately afterward, a massive shift revealed an army of giants.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, my God, the enemy has shifted as predicted!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann was not panicked, but rather, he was happy to hear this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is more excited than threatened by the fact that Rimuru&#39;s prediction has come true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he does not forget his main point in his excitement. After the &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; to the home country, they have just switched their attention to the battle in earnest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, the Titans who had moved to the new location were convinced that their surprise attack had succeeded. They believed that the enemy must be in a panic since they had all traveled several days by Mai&#39;s authority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s group had deliberately made their march look like a march to catch Luminas off guard. They expected that the enemy would see this and take countermeasures, and that they would not be fully prepared to intercept the Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in fact, they are not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not something to be panicked about as of yesterday or today, but a defensive posture had been constructed to be able to respond to the situation without sleep or rest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The majesty of the &quot;Binding Chain Giant Gods&quot; is clear even though they are still at a distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More than their numbers, their quality is overwhelming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each of them was huge, a mass of muscles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Giant ogres, single-eyed giants (cyclops). Hecatoncheires (multi-armed giants), and many other types of giants were closing in on us in packs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann laughed at the sight of Dagruel&#39;s army as it appeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, this is a spectacular sight. I&#39;m afraid my little skeletons may be a little too much for you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;A little, huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann was answered by a beautiful purple-haired woman standing next to him. She was Shion, looking good in a suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;To tell you the truth, it will be a little... a little tough, but we&#39;ll make it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann is surprisingly competitive and does not whine before the battle. He is even more so because his army is immortal and can easily rise again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well...do you have a plan?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asked the reason for Adalmann&#39;s confident attitude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, it&#39;s not much of a plan, but Albert&#39;s command is quite good. Besides, look closely! Look at the line of our army!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann said, pointing to the orderly line of his men, the Immortal Legion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you think? Even the skeleton soldiers are well equipped by our God!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion realizes that this guy (Adalmann) wanted to brag about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann is led by immortal monsters summoned by Adalmann himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a spectacular sight to see such immortal monsters lined up in perfect order inside the long wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The main force was led by two thousand death knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The death knights led by the death lord are an immortal order of knights who ride death horses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The death knights are equipped with full-body magic mail armor that shines dully. Needless to say, it was the best quality armor with the Tempest mark, made in the dwarf factory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although not produced by Garm himself, it is a high-class product made by his disciples, who lavishly used high purity magic steel. Its performance is well known, and it blended well with the mana of the death knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Since its defensive and offensive power is much improved, it is more dangerous than its original grade, </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 18.67px; height: 16.00px;"><img alt="A-" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 18.67px; height: 16.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rank. It was now as close to A rank as it could get, and it had become strong enough to live up to its name as a mainstay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s not all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to the mainstay, there is a hidden gem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Deployed on the long wall are lower-ranking monstars that lack direct offensive power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The total number of them is 50,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zombie soldiers, 10,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bone Soldiers, 20,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bone Archers, 10,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bone knights, 10,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The number of skeleton knights was overwhelming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, they are weak individuals with an average strength of about D rank, so they would be of little use to us even if they are used as they are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, what is noteworthy here is the equipment of the monsters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The latest weapons, which were manufactured at full capacity by the factories in the country of the monsters, were used in the game, as Adalmann boasted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The armor was standardized, and the uniforms of the monster nation (Tempest) were identical in performance, although the colors differed according to the ranks. The uniforms have a reasonable level of protection, and even have fire-resistance, cold-resistance, and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most notable feature of this uniform is a portable recoilless missile launcher carried by a skeleton archer. The missile projectile, which is launched at five times the speed of sound, contains not only explosives but also compressed mana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were carried by skeleton soldiers, who were trained to be assisted by two skeleton archers for every one skeleton archer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, as many as 10,000 mobile batteries were born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the number of bullets is not that large. The total number of rounds was 50,000, including one round loaded from the beginning and two rounds carried by each soldier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next, the zombie soldier was carrying an automatic rifle (assault rifle).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it is a gunpowder weapon with no mana, its destructive power is not to be underestimated. Although it would not be effective against enemies with physical resistance, it was expected to be effective against lower-ranked Titans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These firearms had been banned by Rimuru&#39;s decision, although the manufacturing method had been researched and established. However, only this time, the experimental operation was permitted under the condition that the serial number and the tracking magic were stamped on them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The truth is that Ciel is the only one who is aware of this, though he was busy with his work when the document came around and he stamped his seal without checking it carefully. Rimuru himself was unaware of such a situation, but it was probably lucky that Adalmann did not know about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is not the only secret weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Last but not least is the equipment of the Bone Knight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, they are all equipped with &quot;Imperial magic saber&quot;. They even had a &quot;spell gun&quot; hanging from their waist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Armed with armaments salvaged from the imperial soldiers, the sabers had greatly increased their offensive power while ignoring their defensive power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it was a mess, Adalmann decided that if suicide attack tactics were incorporated into the immortal soldiers who did not fear death, their strength would be irrelevant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the whole idea of the Immortal Legion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An army of immortals who did not need to eat or sleep had been assigned as the first line of defense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trouble was, these immortals had all their abilities increased under Adalmann&#39;s control. In addition, the &#39;Holy-Demonic Reversal&#39;, the power of the Ultimate Gift &#39;Necronomicon&#39;, had changed their attributes, so that the &#39;Anti-Demonic Intrusion Barrier&#39; that the long wall had put up was not a barrier against demons. The &#39;Anti-Demonic Reversal&#39;, the power of the Ultimate Gift &#39;Necronomicon&#39;, changes its properties, so it is unaffected by the &#39;Anti-Demonic Barrier&#39; that the longwalls put up, and can work without any problem even during the daytime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike in the labyrinth, they cannot be resurrected once they are destroyed...but since holy magic does not work, it is an advantage that they are not purified by turn undead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only those who have fought against them can understand how evil the undead are now that they have become holy beings. Since they cannot be killed by conventional attacks, the only way to stop them is to destroy them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such an army of immortals (Immortal Legion) was deployed to intercept the enemy by making good use of the long wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The longwall is more than five meters high and is arranged in such a way that it is easy for snipers to get a clear view of the area below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, the original function of the longwall was precisely to serve as a defensive facility that Luminas had built to thwart Dagruel&#39;s territorial ambitions. The appearance of these weapons was unforeseen, and the vampires were supposed to intercept them with their magic, but the details are unimportant, since they have secured their advantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s eyes narrowed at the sight of Adalmann&#39;s men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s honest impression was that it would be meaningless to have so many skeletons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he changed his mind when he saw the equipment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, what bothered me more was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, Adalmann... let me ask you, how did you get all that equipment?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The equipment for the men is provided by their superiors. That was the common understanding among the corps commanders and the top brass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, if they applied for and received permission, they were given equipment. However, it was a waiting list, and even the top brass were not allowed to skip out of the process.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the workshop of the monster country (Tempest), the Second Corps led by Geld was given priority. Since this is directly related to the national defense, no one has complained about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although all the members have been equipped recently, it is difficult to maintain them because there are so many of them. Since they are made of magical steel, most of them can heal themselves, but it is still true that most of the reservations are filled by the Second Corps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next is for commercial use for adventurers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the purpose of this business is to earn foreign currency as part of the national policy, Shion could not interfere in the business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, waiting for free equipment takes too much time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a situation, there are many roughnecks in &quot;Yomigaeri&quot; and they spend every day in training.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This in itself is commendable, but it is not productive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some people may think that it is not a problem because they are professional soldiers, but they often break their equipment or tear their uniforms, so they use the repair workshop with a certain frequency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, for free.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, Shion received many complaints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under such circumstances, it was impossible to apply for new equipment, and the official equipment of &quot;Yomigaeri&quot; was still in its initial state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even then, they were given only to the executives and early members, and not to the newcomers who had recently joined the group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For those newcomers, apprentice craftsmen had been given the equipment they had made for practice, and they had been making their own equipment... but the appearance of the equipment was not consistent, and they had to use bandanas and armbands to emphasize the purple color, somehow keeping up appearances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, who had no choice but to ask Rimuru for new equipment, was filled with a sense of wonder as to why Adalmann, a newcomer to the group, was getting new equipment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To this question, Adalmann answered with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, it&#39;s a simple story. We took cheap equipment worn by adventurers and smashed it, or directly purchased iron ore with the money we got, and so on. I also have contacts with merchants, so I made use of them as well. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No! Wait! I don&#39;t think challengers will come to the level you&#39;re guarding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is right to wonder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann&#39;s guardianship is between sixty-one and seventy levels, so it should be designated on the reverse side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for that, I have sent my men on a mission. It&#39;s good for training, so we can kill two birds with one stone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann had sent his monsters to the upper floors to make a killing. In the spirit of &quot;it&#39;s all right as long as we don&#39;t get caught&quot;, they were doing quite reckless things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I&#39;m glad to see that many of the Imperial soldiers have good equipment. But the most delicious thing is to defeat the iron golem. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing Adalmann&#39;s cheerful voice, Shion understood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not only playing with adventurers in the labyrinth, but was also diligently collecting materials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The terrain of the 51st to 60th levels is rocky and sometimes golem monsters appear. Among them, iron golems are rich in high-quality iron. If such monsters were defeated and stored in the labyrinth, high-quality magical steel would be produced before long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Defeating iron golems was not only a good way to train for combat, but also to collect materials. It kills two birds with one stone, and Shion can&#39;t help but groan when he catches a glimpse of Adalmann&#39;s abundant financial resources.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;What&#39;s that? (Is he making more money than I am, by any chance ? )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">), Shion suddenly realized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the contrary, there was a possibility that the other guardians of the hierarchy were also doing some kind of financial scheming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Shion himself, let&#39;s look back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was not originally attached to Yi Mai Chi money. In the village of ogre to which Shion belonged, the blood and knowledge of otherworlder were inherited. Therefore, he knew the economic concept itself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion did not care about money in the first place. It is only recently that I started to pay attention to such things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion himself did not even have a wallet, as if he thought that Adalmann was making more money than me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Recently, the number of Shion&#39;s subordinates had been increasing, and he was beginning to realize that this situation was not good for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a limit to the deception. The executives of &quot;Yomigaeri&quot; seemed to be having a harder time than Shion was, and Shion could not be indifferent to the money-raising.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Benimaru and Souei are making a surprisingly large amount of money, and they have been updating all of their equipment with their abundant funds. The benefits for the members are also generous, making it a popular place to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, Gabil is also reasonably wealthy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He and Vesta jointly registered patents on their research discoveries, and he earned a regular income. Gabil&#39;s subordinates were also paid, so none of them had to worry about the cost of equipment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So it was Shion who had the least money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima, who had come to support Shion at Rimuru&#39;s request, approached him in shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, come on, Shion-san, you don&#39;t have to think about how to get money, you can just steal it from the enemy!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He made a very absurd and devilish proposal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a very problematic statement from the Prosecutor General of the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, which is in charge of investigating the great evil in the country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, however, felt as if his eyes were opened when he heard this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, you have a point!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see. I&#39;m so smart!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, who was listening at the side, was very excited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, who was listening to them, thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not right to talk about it on the battlefield, he thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is true that Adalmann himself has robbed adventurers of their equipment in the labyrinth. But he did so only after ensuring their safety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann has some common sense left over from his former human life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he was preparing the equipment, he gave various kinds of allowances to the craftsmen to get them to give him preferential treatment. Like Shion, they would never say, &quot;Do it for free! like Shion did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why they were able to prepare something reasonable and promptly... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(This is not good. (It would be better to keep quiet to Shion-dono.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann is very wise to think like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A mouth is a curse. Gadra (Master), Adalmann&#39;s good friend who came to his rescue, nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it is true that even Adalmann feels that there are some problems with the fact that his newcomers are better equipped than the old guard of Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Common sense tells us that we should favor the strong over the small fry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t want to be criticized for this, so I shouldn&#39;t draw Shion&#39;s attention any further.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Adalmann decided to quickly digress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well then, Shion-dono, let us take the lead first as planned,&quot; he said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion-dono then turned the point to the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion nodded his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion nodded his head. I give you permission to go ahead and do whatever you want!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann was relieved to hear that the permission was granted.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then the battle begins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s army, which was supposed to reap all the benefits of the war and head for the holy city at breakneck speed, was suddenly blocked in its march.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmmm, what a cheek...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel muttered in frustration as he watched his vanguard troops being blown away by missiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an unexpected situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had intended to strike the enemy who had let their guard down, but his plan had been foiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What now, brother?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the question from Glassord, Dagruel&#39;s trusty brother.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only then that Dagruel realized that his voice had escaped from his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;fufufu, it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been in a real battle. Let&#39;s let him play for a while so that he can get back to his instincts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was frustrating to be wrong on the first move, but it did not matter much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy resistance was more fierce than he had expected, but even this was of little concern to Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The number of &quot;Binding Chain Giant Gods&quot; is 30,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, there were some inexperienced and weak soldiers among them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if they were sifted out, it was enough if only the elite remained. In fact, it was better for the survival rate of the soldiers to drop out before the battle intensified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Understood. We will let the new recruits and those without &#39;Ultraspeed Regeneration&#39; return here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord also understood Dagruel&#39;s thoughts, nodded his head lightly, and gave his instructions. He was very familiar with the situation and did not seem to be overawed by the prospect of a major war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the generals are calm, their subordinates regain their composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since there was no disturbance in the chain of command, they quickly regained their posture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, the Titans began to throw projectiles using their monstrous strength. The attack was not prepared from the beginning, but was simply an attack of crushing giant rocks to a reasonable size and throwing them as they pleased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this was a very destructive attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was equivalent to a skeleton archer&#39;s missile launcher, so it was easy to understand how the Titans had such unreasonable combat capability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rock thrown in this way rained down on the long wall. The hit areas were severely damaged, and the monsters there were reduced to dust without any way to withstand the damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the longwall itself is still standing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right, what emerged from the peeled off outer wall was the dull glow of the magical steel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Luminas, you&#39;ve prepared something nasty!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s difficult to move inside the long wall because of the wards. As long as we don&#39;t break it, the battle will remain deadlocked.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord analyzed the situation in an uninterested way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel sniffed and observed the situation calmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His first move was not a good one, but it was a foregone conclusion. After all, the cunning Demon Lord Rimuru was waiting on the enemy side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had thought that Michael had crushed Rimuru, but to my surprise, I heard that Rimuru had destroyed Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We should no longer underestimate him as a new demon lord. He had been recognized as a demon lord, but now he had become a demon lord who should be recognized as a rival or even a stronger demon lord than himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru&#39;s specialty is the tactic of spotting the enemy&#39;s strategy and then taking advantage of it. Dagruel fully understood that Rimuru did not like to see his allies suffer any casualties through their past relationships.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As was Rimuru&#39;s strategy, immortal monstars were the first to be deployed. If we ignore the anomaly that they are moving even in the daytime, they are just weak monsters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, their offensive power is not negligible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have never seen such a weapon before, but as you can see, it is too powerful for a low-ranked warrior to withstand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them tried to make a suicide attack, but they were flung down by the attacks of the zombie soldiers who had been lining up to attack them. It seems that they are not magic, but are sending small pieces of debris at high speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both attacks were effective against Giants. Although they have high resistance to magic as a race trait, these attacks seemed to be physical attacks and were meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Low-level warriors without regenerative abilities were helplessly beaten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fortunately, the enemy&#39;s defenses were no better than those of ordinary undead. The battle was a long-range firefight, inflicting considerable damage on both sides.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The long wall that Luminas had built was probably the reason for this strategy, but it was not fun for Dagruel to have to fight so hard against an opponent who normally would not take a stand against him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, dear. I thought I had underestimated Rimuru, but I never expected this. I didn&#39;t expect my pretty soldiers to be defeated by a bunch of lowly undead. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel complained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel remembers his old memories, but his character has not changed. He does not dislike Rimuru, and he does not want to antagonize his old friends if he can help it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the memory of the old gods, when they were purely rampaging to dominate the planet, makes Dagruel&#39;s heart grow fiercer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He rebelled against Veldanava, the god, to show off his existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel believed that this was what Veldanava wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A child is more than its parents, a pure wish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We cannot disappoint God by failing to live up to his expectations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are those who have been charged with the task of &quot;killing God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel was one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why we can&#39;t stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if it means betraying our friends, even if we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the right thing to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel suddenly remembered something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Luminas who murdered my friend Twilight and I have been at loggerheads ever since that day. This is another reason why we must fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, Luminas, the demon lord whom Dagruel recognizes as his rival, has killed his parents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a man of resentment, jealousy, and respect for the murder of his best friend. With these mixed feelings, Dagruel has complicated feelings for Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think about Dagruel&#39;s sons, Dagura, Leura, and Debra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knew from their presence that they were in this battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wondered how they would fight, even though we were enemies this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are spoiled sons who are strong only in power but not so strong in ability. They would be a touch of armor in front of a &quot;real&quot; demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel loves his sons, but he does not expect it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He dared not train them because he did not want them to bear the fate of the &quot;murderer of their parents&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is absolutely impossible to defy the Creator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But his sons are free from the curse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Yes. I will conquer my way. So you are free to live the way you believe ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course, to enjoy freedom, we need power to protect it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What about the boys, brother?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn asks Dagruel, amused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know. If they stand in front of us as our enemies, we will beat them up without any kind of mercy! If you can feed on the pain, good. Or else...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-Or... you will rot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the absolute rule of this world - the law of the jungle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I hope you&#39;re getting stronger. I hope you&#39;re getting stronger... at least not to the point where you&#39;re afraid of me.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel has no doubts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He only does what he has to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel is a warrior, to the point of stupidity.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time for the Titans to unleash their fury on this battlefield is almost upon us.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.147n2zr"></a><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Adalmann and his men began to fight, Shion was ready.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You heard me, boys.

We&#39;ll take equipment from the enemy and prepare our own!&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s men are indeed the best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They read the Lord&#39;s thoughts accurately and showed their motivation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this, Shion nodded his head in satisfaction. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yomigaeri and Shion&#39;s SS had now grown to an astonishing size.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion finally began to think about the cost of equipment, but that was a problem that Gobzo and others had been worrying about for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they had given up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Shion&#39;s subordinates were all capable people, it was agreed that they should be able to obtain weapons and armor by themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, it was acceptable for us to be ill-equipped, but this time, we had a chance to procure them in an absurd way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only Gobzo thought that he might get angry with me later, but this is also the usual case, so I agreed to it without worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looting in war is an act that should be prohibited. Looting from civilians is never allowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, disarming the enemy in order to neutralize them is allowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we can see from the fact that Adalmann utilized the weapons taken from the imperial soldiers, it was left to each commander to decide what to do with the arms obtained by defeating the enemy forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(fufufu, even that Adalmann prepared his own equipment for his men. Even I can do it ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Shion had a high self-esteem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had thought of asking Rimuru to help him, but he changed his mind, thinking that he was being too generous. In this respect, Shion has grown up, but he still has a long way to go before he jumps into the easy way of robbing from the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this time, it helped to boost the morale of the participants.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is also suddenly motivated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, the army of giants in front of us is wearing large armor. They can take all the materials they want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It brings a smile to everyone&#39;s face.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, as for Shion&#39;s men...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With less than a hundred members, the &quot;Yomigaeri&quot; are all treated as executives. As it should be, even the weakest of them were ranked Over A in strength since they had become a tribe of deadly demons named by Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the hornless demons, and they are completely individualistic, with some of them recruiting subordinates from the SS and others pretending to be lone wolves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them are young girls, but some of them have a large number of men in their ranks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then there is Shion&#39;s fan club.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This group is led by Dagura, Leura, and Debra. The honorary president is Gobzo, but this is not important since he is more of a scullery maid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The SS is also known as the Terror Knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The total number of those who are skilled in battle is as many as 3,000, consisting of miscellaneous races of the Shion faction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>They had been trained through the past battles, and like the death knight, they had grown up to be the elite of the </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 18.67px; height: 16.00px;"><img alt="A-" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 18.67px; height: 16.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this battle, they were going to be the main force in the true sense of the word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only problem was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you sure about that, Das? If you want to go back to your father, it&#39;s time to go now, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The relationship between Dagruel and Dagura and his men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Father and sons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were worried that they might not be able to kill each other seriously, given their kinship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I do not think that any of them, including Shion, would betray us. They are only concerned about whether they can really fight or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gobzo is right. You can come back after the war is over, and there&#39;s no need to push yourself too hard, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion also said to Gobzo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Dagura and the others laughed cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t worry! Whether it&#39;s your father or your uncle, we&#39;ll beat them to a pulp!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah! Let&#39;s show them how we really do it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Whoo-hoo-hoo! It makes my stomach rumble... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My stomach is growling...? Shion thought for a moment, &quot;What is this guy talking about?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-But, Debra&#39;s words are always strange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, she is fat, and it&#39;s no wonder that she is ringing. However, it is not a sign of motivation, Shion thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it&#39;s too much trouble to go into it, so I just let it pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they say it is all right, it must be all right. The problem was my uncle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru told me that Dagruel&#39;s change of mind had something to do with his uncle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru told me that there were two of them, and that one of them was extremely troublesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dagruel has a younger brother, tell me what you know.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asked the question straightforwardly, thinking that he should have asked earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In response, Dagura and the others opened their mouths frankly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their reactions are quick, as they have no intention to hide anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! I heard there are two of them. My uncle Glassord, who is my father&#39;s second-in-command, has been helping me a lot, but I&#39;ve never even met this Fenn guy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;From what I heard, he was so bad he was sealed up? The story that he beat his father is a bit unbelievable, but it&#39;s possible if the rumors are true. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion nodded his head, though he did not have much information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see, Dagruel-dono was indeed strong. I&#39;d like to ask him for a match, but if Fenn and the others are as strong as him, they must be a threat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He does not seem to be a threat at all as he smiles wryly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Debra, feeling encouraged by Shion&#39;s confidence, gets into a good mood to imitate him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, if you leave it to us, I&#39;m sure my father and uncles can handle it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Shion starts to feel uneasy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They say, &quot;Look at other people&#39;s behavior and you&#39;ll see how they behave themselves,&quot; and that&#39;s exactly what happened this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima advises Shion like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you should not be so careless. Dagruel was really strong, and to be honest, it would be tough even for me if I didn&#39;t play hard. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion agreed with this opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would like to challenge Dagruel, but he does not think he can win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, who had been in close contact with Dagruel, just wanted to test his strength against the warrior-like Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But still, it&#39;s hard to believe that he betrayed us, isn&#39;t it? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, maybe he betrayed us, or maybe he had something he wanted to do. Well, it will be clear once we defeat him, so there&#39;s no point in thinking about it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima answered Shion&#39;s question bluntly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel is a naturally occurring indigenous god. They are super-living creatures that have lived far longer than the present human race.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such long-lived species are usually acquainted with each other and have some kind of relationship with each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps they knew Feldway, too, Ultima thought, and if so, the word &quot;betrayal&quot; might be a strange one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At any rate, there was no answer to his question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that they were enemies, there was no need to take any chances, and the victor was the righteous one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion agrees with Ultima&#39;s thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;In the old days, I would have ridden alone and challenged Dagruel-dono to a single combat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what the old Shion would have done, without thinking about whether he could win or not. That&#39;s a story we can all agree on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even now, Shion thinks it would have been easier if he had defeated Dagruel himself. Now that he is in charge of the army, he understands that such an outburst is a bad idea.... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And yet, now, I am able to think of a plan like this. I&#39;ve become more mature now.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion praised himself in such a way, satisfied with the growth of his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he thought that no one would agree with him, Debra made a foolish remark again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? Shion-sama is not fat at all!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, everyone thought &quot;He&#39;s dead, isn&#39;t he?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s dead, isn&#39;t he?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Debra, the youngest of the three brothers, just spreads out horizontally no matter how much she eats, and it seems like her brain is not being nourished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is the biggest fool of the three brothers, and the most boisterous of them all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He lacks the ability to read the air even more than Gobzo, and makes these gaffes without thinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, of course, these comments infuriated Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, Shion is not overweight and does not care about it, but he is angry, so he can&#39;t help it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion smiled a very nice smile and clenched his fists. Then he punched Debra in the stomach.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill008.jpg" src="images/image37.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was what is called a corkscrew punch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You fucking idiot!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he said to Debra, who was lying on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Here&#39;s your reward...&quot; he says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Debra faints with a big smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his two older brothers look at him enviously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These two brothers are not as stupid as Debra, but they are stupid too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, who is dealing with these three brothers, is feeling something dreadful at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, he was impressed by them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were getting to the point where they didn&#39;t need to be so tough any more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Debra, for example, only fainted even though I hit her quite seriously, but her body itself is still in good shape.

Even if I lose, we have Ultima and Luminas-sama. Who will win in the end?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel and his two brothers. Others, the strong ones we haven&#39;t seen yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s will to fight will not be discouraged in the face of an enemy whose strength is unknown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the worst case scenario, even if he loses his entire army, even if Shion himself falls, he is determined to destroy Dagruel on this land.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen! Adalmann has made the first move, but the real attack will come later! Show these fools what we can do!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion announced loudly to his morale-boosting friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In response, the crowd roared with cheers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was like a group of fans attending an idol concert.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Shion and her followers, nervousness is nothing to worry about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion smiles wryly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her smile encouraged and empowered her allies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima, who had been listening to the exchange between Shion and the others, laughed in disgust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s eyes are already the eyes of a Predator who is aiming at his prey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Shion&#39;s eyes were already looking at Predator&#39;s eyes, as if he was aiming at his prey. I should learn from him.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I should learn from him), I secretly respected him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess for Shion, even the army of giants is just food for their own improvement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His ultimate positivity was an ideal that Ultima, as a spiritual life form, could learn from and admire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is no wonder that Diablo recognizes Shion, and Ultima will do its best to support Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I will interject at the right time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shion-san, the operation is going well as planned, and we should probably get ready for it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he pointed out, Adalmann himself was about to make a move to move the war back to a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The war has just begun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From this point on, the intensity of the war will only increase.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann jumps onto the back of Wenti, who has revealed himself as a gehenna dragon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti soars high into the sky as if waiting for him. He has reverted to his original form, the evil dragon form, and is happily scattering his ominous youki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Youki, which would kill a weak human instantly, give Adalmann the power to fight back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann glared down from above the battlefield, feeling comfortable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Everything is going well,&quot; Adalmann said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lower-level undead soldiers had been neutralized by the missiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re just waiting to be overrun, but since they are essentially small fry, we should give them credit for fighting the good fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nodding his head, Adalmann thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, well, I&#39;m going to launch an inhumane attack now, should I give them a warning?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No need, Adalmann thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be incompatible with an aggressor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann concluded, and a voice beside him agreed with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, well. Well, this is not a one-horse race, and there is no point in talking over each other. We should seize the victory, however cowardly it may be, rather than abandoning our superior position and being defeated fairly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Gadra (Master) who had been following us with his flying magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann laughed, saying that he was a good friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s right. I&#39;ll release my magic with the greatest flamboyance and surprise the enemy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then it&#39;s a race. Let&#39;s see who&#39;s better today!&quot; he said happily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra answered happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Adalmann and Gadra started chanting spells one after the other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both Adalmann and Gadra can now work magic without chanting. However, when it comes to the use of extreme magic, it is more comfortable to chant spells to unify one&#39;s mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially in the case of Adalmann, he had a firm image that magic is something that is performed by borrowing the work of God. He spins words of prayer as if giving thanks for his good fortune to be given the Ultimate Gift &#39;Necronomicon&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann chose a forbidden summoning technique that cannot be used inside the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The area of influence is too wide and the damage is difficult to predict.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann chose this magic because he did not have to worry about the damage in this battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, it is a secret magic that is not known to the general public, and it is said that it is impossible for a human being to use it even if he/she has knowledge of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to an ancient document, it is said that a great magician tried to use it with several people, but failed. The reason for this is partly because it is difficult to control, but also because the process of integrating individual mana did not work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Adalmann was also nervous about whether he would succeed or not, since it was the first time for him to use this kind of magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he chose it only because it seemed to be the most spectacular, so if he failed, that would be a story for that time. Gadra would laugh at me, but I would only unleash a different kind of magic at that time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, who is so determined, determines the area of influence of his spells without any hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although mana consumption is high, it is not a problem for Adalmann, who boasts a magicule of the level of the awakened demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The preparation for the magic is completed without any problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Ah, I see... this explains why I don&#39;t need to chant any spells.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Filled with a pleasant sense of satisfaction, Adalmann fully grasps his power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Now, now, Gadra! This is the ancient and most powerful magic - &quot;Tempest Me-Teare&quot;!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that once a spell has been successfully cast, a word is engraved in the mind, and the second time it can be cast instantly by simply selecting it. Checking his power like this, Adalmann unleashes his magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, a super magic circle suddenly appeared in the sky, shimmering brightly, and light poured down toward the earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beautiful as a miracle on a starry night - but a terrifying light of death and destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This magic is named after the country that Adalmann and his friends love. We chose it because we like it, and it has a terrible destructive power that lives up to its name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The magic that the great magicians of the past had wished to achieve had come into full effect in this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The light that pours down on the earth is a meteorite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meteorites of more than a thousand meters in height are filling the earth with destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how many Titans boasted of their &#39;Ultraspeed Regeneration&#39;, it was meaningless if the damage was too severe for them to recover from.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The area was too large, and there was nowhere to run.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Limbs that tried to catch the meteorite were blown off, and heads were crushed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Giants, which had intended to be overrun by the huge force, were crushed helplessly by the even larger force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann&#39;s extreme magic was more effective than he had intended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a very short time, he had disabled as many as 30% of Dagruel&#39;s army.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Behold, Gadra! I&#39;ve already won, haven&#39;t I?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meteorite impact had caused a huge explosion. Looking down at the boiling earth, Adalmann declares victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is surprised at the power of the explosion, which is more powerful than he had expected, but boasts about it as if it were a matter of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His bone face has no expression, so he is not recognized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann is more than happy to show off to his former rival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is not interesting for Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now Adalmann used summoning magic, one of the secrets of dark magic, which is based on &#39;imaginary matter&#39;. It is the ultimate magic to create (image) an imaginary meteorite and summon it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The imaginary substance that appears in the world becomes &#39;real&#39; under the influence of the laws of physics. The effect is temporary, but long enough to destroy the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Why does he remember this kind of magic ? This is not &quot;holy magic&quot; or &quot;necromancy,&quot; but more like &quot;summoning magic,&quot; which is more like &quot;dark magic&quot;-which is my specialty ! I&#39;m good at it!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Well, I am Gadra, who can&#39;t be honest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I lost because of something outside my field of expertise, I can still make excuses. However, this was a challenge to Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he has to admit the power of &quot;Tempest Me-Teare&quot;, and he is secretly admiring his best friend&#39;s performance, he cannot honestly admit defeat as a master of magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Above all, Gadra himself has just joined Diablo&#39;s team. He wanted to take a shot at something big here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The survival of the human race is at stake in this war, but it could also be seen as a battle for supremacy in the world. If so, Gadra thought it would be a good idea to gain some kind of recognition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he did so, at least he would not be abandoned by Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Gadra retorted in a hateful manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Spit it out! I&#39;ll show you the essence of real magic!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these words, he completes the magic he is building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is reborn as a metal demon, and now he is able to use the ultimate magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra makes full use of the Ultimate Gift &#39;Grimoire&#39; and unravels the knowledge of the origin of magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The magic that even Adalmann does not know is the essence of dark magic taught by Diablo and Ultima.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra has been diligently asking for lessons in his spare time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The culmination of his efforts is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Come, all who suffer from eternal hunger! Eat them all with your fangs!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">- &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot; was the most vicious dark magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a well-known story that the most powerful holy magic is &quot;Disintegration&quot; which is the ultimate destruction magic against people and objects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is also famous for the fact that only a few people can use it, but its power is well known. It is said that no one can survive a direct hit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there were some drawbacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most important of them is the narrow range of influence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if it is the most powerful magic against people, it cannot be used against armies. That is the kind of magic it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, the existence of dark magic, the counterpart of &quot;disintegration&quot;, was known only to a very limited number of people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the dark magic that Ultima and others are good at: nihilistic banishments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a terrible magic that eats up the target by the emptiness that comes out of the hell. Moreover, this magic can expand its sphere of influence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, Gadra had set the area of influence to the whole battlefield. He had put all his mana into his &quot;Nihilistic Banish&quot; and completed it as a wide-area extermination spell called &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as the surgeon had intended, an extremely large magic circle appeared on the ground and in the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, as if connecting heaven and earth, a dark discharge began, releasing countless numbers of sunspots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the fangs of darkness that devour all matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the forbidden art of dark magic, the manipulation of emptiness, which is forbidden.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The emptiness unleashed in this world will not disappear until its negative existence value (mai nasu energy) is reduced to zero. It fills the inside of the &#39;Barrier&#39; of the magic circle that connects heaven and earth, and makes it disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is one of the ultimate magic that could destroy the world if controlled incorrectly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as the magic is activated, Gadra bursts into laughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wahaha ha ha! How do you like it? Isn&#39;t it great ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked so innocent and happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Adalmann was not so happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Idiot! What are you thinking ! What will you do if you fail to control this dangerous magic and it goes out of control ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He understood the danger of &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot; by the Ultimate Gift &#39;Necronomicon&#39;, and his face was pallid with no expression on it. He was screaming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Gadra answered without any apology.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Because I want to show off, too!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Adalmann becomes weak. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, you don&#39;t...&quot; he says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He unintentionally expresses his true feelings without any sense of dignity or anything. Adalmann was also taken aback by Gadra&#39;s childish comment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, it was hard for Gadra to make excuses, since he was afraid that the world would collapse if he failed to control the system. So, he opened his mouth and said openly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, that&#39;s all right. We have succeeded!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra said irresponsibly, &quot;You and I will be fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra, who showed no signs of remorse, must have been a mad genius even if he was rotten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Recognizing this again, Adalmann let out a big sigh and gave up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was useless to say anyway, and in fact, there was no problem since he had succeeded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy forces had been greatly reduced in number by the two extreme magics, and they were close to being destroyed. Compared to the initial number, they were already reduced to less than half, and in a normal war, they would have given up and retreated long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the visibility was poor due to Gadra&#39;s &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot;, they seemed to be on the verge of successfully defeating the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann and his team, who hoped that the war would end as it did, looked at the situation below with bated breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The result was...</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel saw at a glance the danger of the magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had been planning to overrun the city as soon as the battle was opened, but the small fry stopped him in his tracks. Then, just when he thought he had reached a stalemate, his troops were reduced by more than 50% by extreme magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a miscalculation on Dagruel&#39;s part, but it was not a great loss for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it was kept secret from the public, magic could not defeat the Giants. A person who dies by this means is not only out of luck, but also out of ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could overlook the falling meteorites with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, I praised it for its magic, and thought of using it to determine who would be qualified to participate in this battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it had been an attack such as dropping a huge rock stored in a different space from the sky, I would have judged that it was too destructive to ignore because of the addition of potential energy to the mass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But instead, &quot;Tempest Me-Teare&quot; was an attack by a magically created meteorite, which could be canceled by the power of Giants without any problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A warrior should not be late in using magic against a group of people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, none of Dagruel&#39;s core members or his main warriors ever stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the right thing to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the magic invoked by Gadra was no good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot; penetrates and damages even the absolute ability of &#39;magic nullification&#39; possessed by the true Titans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With &#39;magic nullification&#39;, which is an absolute anti-magic guard, it can automatically neutralize all kinds of magic attacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of this ability, the Titans cannot be defeated by magic. Therefore, even an extreme magic such as &quot;Tempest Me-Teare&quot; could be overlooked with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who would die by it were dismissed as immature... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ultima, you spread your forbidden spells so carelessly...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel complained, thinking of Ultima&#39;s innocent smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only the kings of demons should know the magic of invoking the emptiness of hell. As for the one who would spread it, the one who comes to mind out of the seven is most likely Ultima, or Raine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or Raine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mizeri is too serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, Diablo, and Testarossa, these three are surprisingly sensible people, so they are eliminated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrera... is possible, but Dagruel judged that he should be excluded because he is not good at teaching others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, Ultima or Raine is the most likely suspect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the culprit would be Ultima, who seemed to be good friends with the immortal Adalmann and his friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel must not be happy to know that, though he was right. Besides, now was not the time to be looking for the culprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fortunately, Dagruel can handle this magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a bitter look on his face, Dagruel raises his hands to the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he releases his power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The attack characteristic of nihilistic magic is the annihilation of existence by negative existence value (mai nous energy). If this is the case, then saturating positive energy can reduce the damage to zero.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel is a giant that can be called a mass of energy. Even if Gadra&#39;s &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot; with its full power was used, it would be no problem to kill it.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s army marches forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They accept the deaths of their comrades with aplomb, overcoming them as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In their eyes, they have the utmost trust and loyalty to Dagruel. They walk the battlefield as if they have nothing to fear.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.3o7alnk"></a><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shhh, I can&#39;t believe it...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sh, I can&#39;t believe it...&quot; &quot;That&#39;s Dagruel-dono, isn&#39;t it? How could he so easily neutralize such dangerous magic? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two were unintentionally struck with admiration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as the &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot; is drowned out, the Titans resume their march, seemingly unconcerned about the deaths of their comrades.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The line was once broken by extreme magic, but before long it had been rebuilt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who escaped instant death are regenerated as if nothing had happened, thanks to their extraordinary resilience, and the number of those who were thought to be greatly reduced turns out not to be so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their appearance was so eerie that it aroused fear in those who confronted them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the Dagruel forces in action, Adalmann and his team became fed up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My God... don&#39;t they feel fear?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Not at all. Normally, they would have thought of a countermeasure or pulled out of the situation...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a problem when we made enemies with those who did not understand our common sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well, it is the same for Rimuru-sama&#39;s subordinates.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well, the same is true for Rimuru-sama&#39;s subordinates.) But I am not stupid enough to say that, so I will point out something different here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m more curious about this, but even if Demon Lord Dagruel erased emptiness, how did he withstand your &#39;Tempest Me-Teare&#39;? It seemed to me that the meteorite disappeared unnaturally...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, as if the magic had been drowned out, Gadra says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was something that had been bothering Adalmann as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There had been casualties among the lower-ranked Titans, but the elite warriors, the senior fighters, were all unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had expected them to be injured at least a little, if they recovered at all, but it was unnatural that they did not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two men looked at each other, searching each other&#39;s thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They quickly decided that thinking was not the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, what do we do now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I used mana too much. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve used too much mana. I&#39;m glad that my Legion is the Legion of the Immortals that does not fear death. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. An army of deathless giants is a nightmare, but your men are just like them...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They sigh in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The unbelievable reality that came right after they had expected to win was a great shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann pats Wenti on the head and orders him to return home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they had intended, they had succeeded in striking him with extreme magic. There was no need to stay long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead, they should quickly return and report the threat of Dagruel&#39;s army.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was to be feared was their steadfastness and resilience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The outpost was over, and what was next was the clash of the major classes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, considering the threat of the Titans that we have just witnessed, I must say that the Immortal Legion has the wrong side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are similarly fearless and resurrectable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, I had a feeling that the Titans would overrun the Immortal Legion with their overwhelming destructive power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could see them being crushed and shattered before we could deal a decisive blow to the Titans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that&#39;s the way it would be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We should just keep on taking out as many of them as possible and reduce the number of Titans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, let&#39;s go back and report to Shion-dono. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I suppose so. We&#39;ll have to discuss the future. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann and Gadra returned to Shion&#39;s place, thinking about the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion received the report.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was wondering what to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion stood on the longwall and had a bird&#39;s eye view of the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had witnessed Adalmann&#39;s and Gadra&#39;s extreme magic, and thought that he might be able to win the battle, but in reality, a harsh reality was waiting for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion had already recognized the troublesomeness of the enemy without any report from Adalmann and his team.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two hours had passed since the start of the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle had shifted to the next stage, a clash between the main battle groups.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the number of the &quot;Binding Chain Kyojin-dan&quot; seems to have been greatly reduced from 30,000, the actual attrition rate was less than 10%. Now, they have formed an assault formation with their elite at the top, and are clashing with the main forces of the Legion of the Immortals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The formation was a crane-wing formation with 2,000 death knights in the center and 10,000 skeleton soldiers with secret weapons on both wings. They are trying to surround the advancing &quot;Binding Chain Kyojin-dan&quot;, but they are outnumbered and cannot surround it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a tactical mistake, but Adalmann was unfazed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you all right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine. I will show those who do not know the horror and terror of a real dead soldier. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, commanding next to Shion, has no intention of winning from the start.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The objective is to reduce the enemy&#39;s strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The real main forces were the Yomigaeri and Terror Knights under Shion and the Bloody Knights under Luminas, and Adalmann and his men had joined the battle as pawns, so to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We should defeat the Over A rank warriors of Dagruel&#39;s camp as much as possible. At the very least, we want to find out the enemy&#39;s weak points. That was the intention behind the plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, Adalmann agreed to this plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was as we had agreed to before the war started. It was the consensus of the Rimuru camp to avoid casualties as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was also an effective strategy for analyzing the Titans&#39; strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Immortal Legion, which is an army of immortals, would not be counted as dead. The conclusion is that they are not counted as dead. After all, Adalmann&#39;s men do not perish even if they die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The key to this strategy was to make the most of the characteristics of immortals, and it was a suicide mission to attack the lured Titans and reduce their numbers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, there is a limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first glance, the battlefield appeared to be in a stalemate, but the trend was tilted in favor of the Titans&#39; forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The skeleton soldiers (bone soldiers) launch a suicide attack, triggering the mana that fills the battlefield. The death knight finishes off the wounded and fallen Titans, but unless he deals a sure fatal blow, the Titans will revive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The trouble here is the giants&#39; huge stature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Titans boast huge bodies of 3 to 5 meters, and their muscular armor is so thick that it is difficult to deal a fatal blow to them. If they took too much time, they would be crushed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first, it worked well, but as time went by, countermeasures were taken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those with long weapons started to check them, and they could no longer approach them carelessly. If they tried to force their way, they would be crushed like pieces of wood, and once that happened, the skeleton soldiers, who were inferior in strength, had become useless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The death knights were also outnumbered and forced to fight hard, and their numbers gradually dwindled.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last, the Bloody Knights led by Louis felt nervous, thinking that it was time for them to make their move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion also tried to deploy the Terror Knights, which he had been saving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The 2,000 death knights are still almost alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If 3,000 Terror Knights are added to the 2,000 death knights, they should be able to fight against the senior fighters of the giants, he thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The number of Over A ranks of the enemy is a thousand against the four hundred of the Bloody Knights. To close the gap, Yomigaeri alone was not enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion thought that he could manage to defeat one opponent with ten players.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, who usually thinks he can get by with his own strength, does not want to see any casualties among his offspring. But here, as a commander, he bit his lip and tried to give the order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Adalmann stopped him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, dear, I&#39;m going to have to play my cards right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, whose mana had recovered, climbed on Wenti&#39;s back again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you have any more tricks?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asks curiously, to which Adalmann replies with a clattering laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ve run out of ideas, so it&#39;s just a matter of time before things turn out the way they are supposed to. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these words, Adalmann returned to the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He invoked &quot;Immortal Legion&quot;, an improved version of necromancy that Adalmann had developed in preparation for this moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Adalmann&#39;s favorite, since it was named after his own legion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This magic has a special effect on a wide area, and the effect is astonishing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It transforms the dead, both friend and foe, who die on the battlefield or within its sphere of influence into undead soldiers who are loyal to its orders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the secret of necromancy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the culmination of Adalmann&#39;s research.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, this magic had already been improved to reconstruct the dead as a nucleus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, in this case, with the death knight as the nucleus, the skeleton soldiers who had been shattered began to gather more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the dead Titan soldiers and soldiers who were still active gathered themselves together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was born were 2,000 huge dead spirit knights (death giants).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The magic weapons made of magical steel that the death knights wore covered their huge bodies of up to four meters in height. It is no wonder that the weapon has been transformed according to the will of its owner, since it is a synthesis of the grudge of the dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann had anticipated this from the very beginning and had devised the secret of creating the immortal giant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is this a lie? Adalmann had prepared such a hidden gem without telling even me...&quot; said Shion in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion could not hide his surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was no wonder, for the huge dead spirit knights (Death Giant) were all monsters of Over A rank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I can&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve never been so glad to have you on my side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said Louis, who was watching the battle beside Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the situation was reversed once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Titans, who had been overwhelmed by their power, have lost their advantage due to the emergence of a greater power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, the giant dead spirit knights (death giants) are immortal. Even if they are crushed or destroyed, they are instantly resurrected under Adalmann&#39;s authority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the giants were not defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The report of nearly 1,000 fighters was false; in fact, there were more than 2,000 senior fighters in the ranks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if they are Over A rank fighters, their wounds are instantly regenerated by &#39;Ultraspeed Regeneration&#39;. They were invincible as long as they didn&#39;t take instant-death damage, and they fought even with the giant dead spirit knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their numbers did not decrease, and the battle was stalemated again.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to Adalmann&#39;s success, Shion&#39;s team has a little more time to spare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a happy miscalculation, since they had not been told of such a trick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Adalmann did not want to create any expectations for the &quot;Immortal Legion&quot; since it was the first public showing of the work, or rather, it was a spur-of-the-moment event.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The result is what has happened now, and the person who is most relieved is Adalmann himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He is a good friend of mine,&quot; said Gadra with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra was pleased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Louis could not help but nod in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s true. Seven Luminaries was a foolish thing to do. I can&#39;t believe they let such a great talent go out to the world. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he says, sounding quite serious and regretful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Louis remembered the old days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that time, Adalmann and Albert were famous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, a genius of holy magic and a high priest. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert, the greatest Holy Knight of all time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both of them were qualified to be heroes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, no heroic eggs were conceived in either of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, they had naturally reached the level of &quot;Immortals,&quot; and if nothing had happened to them, they would have reached the level of saints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, both of them were too much geniuses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why the &quot;Seven Luminary Clerics&quot; were jealous of them and trapped them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &quot;Seven Luminaries&quot; feared that if they continued to grow, they would become a threat even to their own position, so they took measures to keep the Luminas in the dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The name of the plan was, as I recall, to clean up the dead spirit disaster on a large scale.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In reality, however, it turned out to be a battle with dragon zombies prepared by the &quot;Seven Luminaries&quot;, and the two were killed by each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They gladly accepted the request and went to the Great Jura Forest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since they did not return to the holy city, they were presumed dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Demon Lord Luminas, the master of Louis, did not expect that he had fallen into the hands of Demon Lord Kazalim after his death, or that he had fallen into the hands of Demon Lord Rimuru through some strange fate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was disappointed, but Louis felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We should have included these champions in our group at any cost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Albert, one of those champions, was just now drawing his sword on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, that man was Adalmann&#39;s subordinate, wasn&#39;t he? You can clearly see from a distance that he is a great fighter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, who had regained her composure and was watching the battlefield, exclaimed in admiration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagura, Leura, and Debra, who were standing behind her, nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Albert-san, you are really cool! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He sometimes challenges me to a hand-to-hand combat, but he&#39;s really strong, isn&#39;t he?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, he&#39;s playing against Glassord&#39;s uncle! Who would be surprised if either one of them wins!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first, the three brothers were going to support Albert, but they changed their minds when they saw their opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He is strong, huh? So even giants have a warrior who lives by the sword?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey. That&#39;s my father&#39;s brother... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s the second-in-command of the Binding Chain Giant Gods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s our uncle who was our master!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagura and the others reply to Shion&#39;s mutterings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His name is Glassord. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a top-notch two-handed swordsmith, and one of the strongest in the &quot;Binding Chain Giant Gods&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he is inferior to Dagruel in terms of the amount of magicule, his swordsmanship (level) is said to be superior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is said to be mild-mannered and intelligent for a Giants.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Dagruel of today would be calm if he were only mild-mannered, but he is still feared because of his old notoriety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such a Glassord was fighting a duel with Albert.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wielding a two-handed greatsword with his two-meter tall frame moving gracefully, Glassord was clearly a strong man with a strength that set him apart from the others, and he was a unique presence on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert, on the other hand, is a great swordsman, and they are evenly matched despite their difference in height.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is an unbelievable sight for those who know Albert as a top-notch swordsman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite his huge stature, Glassord was able to perform sophisticated techniques with his agile movements. No one other than Albert would be able to compete with him. On the contrary, Albert might be an anomaly to be able to compete with such a person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is able to parry a heavy pressure attack, which would normally crush him with a single blow, like a willow, and even counterattack. He was able to do so only because he was given a set of mythical-grade equipment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he had been equipped with less than legendary-grade equipment, he would have been destroyed the moment he was hit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, one of the hidden characteristics of Glassord is that it can destroy the opponent&#39;s armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This literally means that anyone who crossed swords with Glassord was destined to be defeated unilaterally by having his weapons and armor destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was fortuitous that Albert, who did not know this, was equipped with mythical-grade weapons. This was a miraculous coincidence, since even the three Dagura brothers could not have known it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to such good fortune, the collapse of the front line was barely averted. The irony is that no one noticed it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The threat was there, but the danger remained unnoticed, and the battle between the two warring factions heated up.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast to the battlefield, where even the strongmen have finally made their moves, Shion and his team are in spectator mode.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But my father doesn&#39;t move. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, now that my uncle has left, I guess it&#39;s about time...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;ll take care of him then!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three brothers are so excited that they say things like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion replies to them, feeling annoyed with these idiots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t panic. Of course, I&#39;ll take care of them. You three should lead the Terror Knights and keep out of the way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three agreed without protest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not that they thought they could win. They were just in a good mood, so their replies were light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, they did not forget to give him a warning, even if they were joking around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I understand, but don&#39;t underestimate my father, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re right. Even though Miss is strong... Dad is a real monster...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Woo-hoo-hoo... I&#39;ve never been able to beat him.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not about winning or losing; it was difficult to even stand in front of the haki. It was obvious that the three brothers could not even compete.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Shion&#39;s point of view, these three are good players in their own right. They are getting stronger and stronger with every mock battle, and I am looking forward to seeing their growth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion could certainly sense the seriousness of the three brothers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t do anything reckless. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a very Shion-like statement, though he did not see himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no movement on the battlefield, but his turn would come soon. Shion was ready for battle, knowing it firsthand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Should we just go in and attack at once?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Waiting is not good for him, and breaking the stalemate and winning the game at once might be a good strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, as long as we can manage the enemy general, we are sure to win... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was when Shion thought so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the battlefield changed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was abrupt and harsh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A no man&#39;s land appeared on the battlefield. Several huge dead spirit knights were blown away like pieces of wood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What is that ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s eyes widen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every time there was a flash of silver light, a huge dead spirit knight of Over A rank was knocked down with ease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Standing there is a slender man of extraordinary stature, his body bound with multiple layers of chains.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chains did not hide his alien and intense presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a presence that surpassed even Dagruel&#39;s. Shion&#39;s body was covered with goosebumps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s whole body was covered with goosebumps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His survival instincts were telling him with all his might that the man was dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, that&#39;s...that&#39;s...that&#39;s the one...that&#39;s the one that was sealed up...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is it Fenn&#39;s uncle, the giant god of the Mad Fist who was feared as both a god of war and a raging god of evil ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Whew! I&#39;m hungry!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Debra&#39;s irrelevant remark in this situation is just a corkscrew punch in the belly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re full now, aren&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion changes his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Debra&#39;s stupidity has eased the tension in the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion observed Fenn, thinking that even though he was an idiot, he was a lovable idiot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was over three meters tall, but his chains were more eye-catching.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s no wonder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is that a Gleipnir chain? It&#39;s a tremendous thing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gadra. What is it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. It&#39;s a myth written in ancient texts before the history of mankind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra, who loves to talk about things, shares his knowledge with us, as if he&#39;s got a point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gleipnir. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since mythological times, it has been a chain that has kept the evil gods at bay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the story is true, the chain would have evolved by absorbing the magicule released by the evil god.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since that time, the chain has been a sacred weapon of the Dragon Emperor, sealing both the holy and the evil. It is no wonder that this chain has a performance that surpasses that of the mystical-grade chains in the present age.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is not the chains that we should really fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the evil god enclosed in those chains that is the threat that we should be wary of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It is said that in mythical times, the evil gods were sealed by the Dragon Emperor. Two of the three brothers reformed, but one of them remained violent and was sealed away by the divine chain. That&#39;s Fenn who is raging there, and the chains that bind him are the famous Gleipnir. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra said happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if to prove that he was right, the chains wriggled and pulsed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite the chains that were holding him back, Fenn was smiling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if to say, &quot;I&#39;m having fun, I&#39;m having fun, I&#39;m having fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chains are moving on their own and knocking down the enemies without Fenn doing anything. Over A rank warriors can&#39;t even stop their steps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is astonished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn&#39;s existence value was said to be comparable to Dagruel&#39;s, but it seemed to surpass Dagruel&#39;s by a long shot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s funny. They say there is always someone better than you, but I never thought they were that much better...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s colleagues are also generally high in magicule, and have grown beyond comparison, but Fenn was in a realm that even they could not reach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was in the realm of Veldora and Velgrynd, the best of the best that Shion knew, the &quot;True Dragon&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He&#39;s a monster, isn&#39;t he? You guys can&#39;t handle him.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion assured him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On top of that, Dagruel was coming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thought of that was depressing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you going to do? Do you think we can&#39;t win, or should we withdraw?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima asked innocently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion thinks in an amused way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how much the game is going back and forth, the board can be easily overturned by the appearance of such a monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Ultima said, the only option was to run away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru does not want any casualties. If they followed his orders to the letter, they should consider retreat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that Adalmann and the others are holding out, it would be possible to escape from this place with only Shion and the reinforcements from the land of monsters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, but... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is easy to retreat, but the consequences are obvious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who are left behind, the innocent people living in this land, will be deprived of all their rights by an unreasonable tyranny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this would involve even the sphere of human existence and destroy the realization of Rimuru&#39;s ideal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What should we do then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if we fight against this monster, we will inevitably be annihilated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is here to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not a difficult problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is ready to fight, and he is ready.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is also easy because he has done it many times before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pride of having been in and out of critical situations many times is what keeps Shion going.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s not just Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Which Ultima do you prefer?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asks, and Ultima smiles, &quot;I knew you wouldn&#39;t run away from me,&quot; she says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I like that about Shion-san.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima replies innocently, &quot;Well then, since you and the old man hit it off, I&#39;ll take the rambunctious one over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They decided who would fight whom as if they were discussing their favorite dessert.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their exchange ends on such a light note.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was decided that Ultima would be Fenn&#39;s opponent and Shion, a fellow generals, would face Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following this, Luminas&#39; group made a move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, well, well, well... If a lord is a lord, then his subordinates are his subordinates. Demon Lord Rimuru&#39;s men don&#39;t seem to know the meaning of fear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With such dismay, Louie also announces his participation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His eyes caught sight of the &quot;four-armed&quot; giants running amok.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is Basara, the first of the five great generals, who is the maternal uncle of Dagruel&#39;s sons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were several other strong men in various parts of the battlefield. Following Louis, the Bloody Knights and the seven noblemen ran out to face them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the battlefield became more chaotic.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.23ckvvd"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A sandstorm rages on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn moves, chains dance. As a result, many huge dead spirit knights (death giants) are broken into pieces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn&#39;s eyes caught Adalmann, who was commanding on the back of the gehenna dragon Wenti.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a battlefield theory to target generals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Fenn&#39;s action was the right one, since Adalmann&#39;s power had made the immortals immortal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn runs through the dust at a tremendous speed, which is now flight, closing in on Adalmann with such force that he ignores the presence of anyone who stands in his way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Mwah!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann notices Fenn&#39;s approach and tries to deal with him. He had not been so careless as to think that he was safe in the air, but Fenn&#39;s movement was too fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if the Gleipnir were of infinite length, he tied up the gehenna dragon Wenti without regard for space.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chains were of a mythical-grade that would seal even the gods, and there was no way for Wenti to escape. He was slammed to the ground, unable to move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann escaped as quickly as he could, but Fenn did not miss it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Evil demon! You&#39;re dead!&quot; he shouted simply. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he shouted simply and hit him to get rid of the obstacles in his way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann had expected this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the beginning, he had protected himself with multiple &#39;barriers&#39; so that he would not be caught by surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, with just one blow, Adalmann was knocked to the ground and rolled over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a heavy blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a blow of such absolute violence that it took away not only his will to rebel, but also his will to live. Adalmann experienced it firsthand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A terrible silence fell on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an instant, Fenn took control of the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Ultima has begun to move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before the battle began, Ultima had a secret meeting alone with Luminas. Luminas, who knows the threat of Dagruel, has read this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Violence overturns everything. Knowing this well, Luminas had devised all possible ways to win the war. He wanted to defeat Dagruel even by using the absolute best-kept secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dainty even in the midst of the battlefield, Ultima set out for Fenn with the ease of a stroll.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stands to protect Adalmann.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looks at Fenn and laughs, as if to say, &quot;If they took it from me, I&#39;ll take it back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks at Fenn and sneers, &quot;That&#39;s pretty good. Even I recognized Adalmann&#39;s ability. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, like Ultima, is one of the Twelve Guardians. Even though they were good at supporting the rear, the name of &quot;Gehenna Lord&quot; was not a true one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn was too strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima was not amused by this, and he was unhesitant to show his disdain for Fenn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, really? I was weak, wasn&#39;t I?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn was fighting aura? He is not proud of it, even though he made Adalmann fall to the ground with a blow of his toki-clad fist. He is not even proud of it because he thinks it is a natural result.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima saw through Fenn&#39;s thinking and thought that it was just as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since I am the same way, I can understand Fenn&#39;s feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the strong man&#39;s point of view, the weak are nothing but toys. Ultima, who had reigned as the king of demons until now, had no right to complain to Fenn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The difference in strength was too great. Fenn did not care about them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, they were on the side of the weak. Ultima thinks that this is just a story of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, we do not intend to give up easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Ultima loves games, they will try to win until the end, even if they lose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(If we keep trying, we will win someday. (If we keep trying, we will win someday.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) He is thinking very comfortably.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let me call myself something. I&#39;m Pain Lord Ultima. And you are?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You little brat, you&#39;re so cocky. I&#39;m Fenn. I&#39;m Fenn. I&#39;m gonna die here anyway, so why should I remember you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as they had said each other&#39;s names, the battle had begun.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion remained on top of the longwall, watching for Dagruel&#39;s move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how Shion would deal with the situation, it was obvious that he would lose the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas seemed to have a plan, and some part of his mind was hoping for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that was not enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You cannot win a battle if you expect miracles to happen. Shion was going to pick up the victory, even if it was by force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So that&#39;s my uncle Fenn down there, huh? Come on, even I didn&#39;t expect a monster like that...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re right. You&#39;re right, it&#39;s even worse than we thought. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Uncle Glassord&#39;s a good man, but Uncle Fenn is something else. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. No wonder they sealed him up...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beside Shion, Dagura and Leura were discussing their impressions of their uncle whom they had never seen before. Dagura&#39;s enthusiasm for his father, whom he had promised to defeat, has been dampened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not too much to ask, Shion thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be a fool who did not know himself to think that he could win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Whew! If I&#39;m that skinny, I can beat him with my weight!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, just like Debra who only said this... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Debra really needs to be punished.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Debra really needs to be punished.) That&#39;s what Shion was thinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly the situation changed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm. You&#39;re looking down on me with a lot of composure, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The voice came from behind Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the top of the long wall, the front line but also a defense base. Naturally, the &#39;Anti-Demonic Intrusion Barrier&#39; was in operation, and the area around Shion in particular was lined with multiple layers of the &#39;Multilayer Barrier&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ignoring all of that, I would not be standing here...no, more importantly....</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem is that Shion was unaware of any of them until he was spoken to here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have been monitoring him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even with a Skill like &#39;Spatial Transportation&#39;, he should be able to detect some anomalies. Shion, who could perform &#39;Spatial Domination&#39;, had his surroundings well protected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet-Demon Lord Dagruel was there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why is Dagruel-dono here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion asks as he turns to face the giant standing behind him on the long wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel answers gently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel is a surprisingly gentlemanly man now, if not in the past.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm. I was walking slowly, but you didn&#39;t see me by any chance, did you? If so, you&#39;re not even qualified to stand before me. It would be foolish to take you seriously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion did not feel that he was being mocked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the contrary, he felt that Dagruel was speaking the truth in a very gentlemanly manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Dagruel&#39;s point of view, Shion must have been like a little girl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Shion and Dagruel had met each other many times, they had the same intimidating presence as if they were different persons. Dagruel was undeniably radiating the air of a champion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, however, silenced him with his spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He defied the intimidation and came forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will ask myself if I am qualified! &quot;War Lord&quot; Shion, as Demon Lord Rimuru-sama&#39;s most trusted secretary, I am your opponent!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion said his name, adding a few extra words on his own. Then, he raised his sword &quot;Hercules Deluxe&quot; at Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Some kind of skill, or a trick...there must be a reason for this phenomenon, even if there is a difference in their abilities ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the movement is based on spatial interference, there must be traces left behind. Even if it was a high-speed movement, it is impossible that there is not even an oscillation of the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion tells himself not to be fooled by Dagruel&#39;s bluff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if this...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Huh, what&#39;s the point in even thinking about it? If it does, I&#39;ll just let it go!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-Shion opens his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the answer was as bad as Shion imagined, then admitting it would be tantamount to defeat. Since further protests would be pointless, he decided that there was no point in even thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(With Luminas-sama behind me, it would be my duty to analyze Dagruel&#39;s strength, even if only a little ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) This boldness is one of the good things about Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion lets out a yelp and immerses his mind into the combat mode.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His body, optimized with the Unique Skill &#39;Cook&#39;, helps Shion to increase his strength beyond his existence value.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With &#39;Infinite Regeneration&#39;, Shion&#39;s body has been made to be highly suited for close combat, surpassing even that of a giant. Physically immortal, Shion will never die unless his &quot;Kokoro&quot; is shattered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even now, it easily responds to Shion&#39;s wishes by accepting forces that exceed the limits of its physical body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The full force of the blow was so great that it was almost to the ultimate realm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was going to expose all his power from the very first move, and he was going to bury Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No! Get everyone out of here ! This whole area will be wiped out!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra, who had been looking around for cover, shouted, and in response to his voice, Shion&#39;s SS quickly evacuated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately thereafter, Shion slashes at Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without paying attention to his surroundings, Shion&#39;s consciousness is focused only on Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel, however, is steadfast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks at Shion with the gaze of a wretch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So that&#39;s it, huh? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he mutters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, the result came.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the moment Shion&#39;s sword made contact with his brain, it was held in place by an invisible pressure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? &quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Between Shion and Dagruel, there was a wall of compressed fighting aura? toki wall existed between Shion and Dagruel. It protected Dagruel and blocked Shion&#39;s sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fighting aura? toki. Shion&#39;s slashes could not even touch Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, it was obvious that Shion was no match for him. Her defeat was certain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course. You were not even qualified to stand in front of me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion&#39;s eyes widened in surprise and she stopped moving on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel does not miss it, but since there is no need to take a chance, he remains calm and does not move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He just tells her gently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I only want Luminas. I don&#39;t want you to get in my way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is not convinced by this admonition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is more determined to fight, and begins to challenge Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the battles began in various locations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for the situation, Dagruel&#39;s side is in the lead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a situation, Ultima was fighting a desperate battle after Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Isn&#39;t it funny? Why are you so unconcerned with my nuclear magic: Nuclear Cannon hitting you ? &quot; she said to Fenn. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">she says indignantly to Fenn, but her expression is not as relaxed as it should be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima does not like to admit it, but Fenn was strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even now, he was able to use his Ultimate Skill &#39;Poison King (Samael)&#39; to enhance his power to cast a Nuclear Cannon with a &quot;deadly poison&quot; effect, Fenn did not care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s tough to be a weak guy, you have to learn some tricks to even be able to fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn laughs at me like I&#39;m an idiot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re a disgusting little kid!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima was analyzing the situation calmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not think that he could beat Fenn from the beginning, since it was just a matter of not losing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, there was something wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like the current magic, there was a sense of frustration that could not be explained by the difference of the players&#39; abilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was as if something had been overlooked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, I suddenly remembered that there was a report that bothered me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, Gadra had said that it was as if the magic had been drowned out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The meteorite attack had not been as successful as expected. I thought it was because of the Titans&#39; superior regenerative abilities... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Come to think of it, they didn&#39;t do as much damage as they thought they would, did they? I mean, it seems that only low-ranked warriors were injured...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not unnatural in that respect alone, since it is because they are weak that they die or get injured. However, it was unnatural that there were no wounded fighters among the higher class fighters, if you think about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(It was as if the magic didn&#39;t work...?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) The idea came to my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No way, no way, no way, Ultima&#39;s instincts sounded a warning bell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is true...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima began to feel anxious to let Luminas know as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, at that time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was attacking again and again, even though he knew he could not communicate with Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It could no longer be called a battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was like a toddler&#39;s fretting, and Dagruel seemed to have no respect for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, Shion did not give up because he believed that Luminas had a plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion and Luminas get along surprisingly well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a sense, Shion&#39;s cooking has become decent thanks to Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So Shion trusted Luminas unconditionally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good grief, you&#39;re a quitter,&quot; he said. No matter how many times I try, you can&#39;t even make a scratch on my skin.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Spit it out! Now that we&#39;re done with the preparation, it&#39;s time to give it a real go!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion tried to slash at Dagruel again, determined not to be outdone in spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I say you&#39;re too soft!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s shout of encouragement stopped Shion&#39;s action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just by hearing Dagruel&#39;s voice, Shion was unable to move as if he were in a bind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel walks up to the motionless Shion and just shakes his clenched fist at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, the corner of the long wall where Shion and the others were standing collapsed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even 2,000 years of history were powerless against the fury.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And - not to mention Shion, who took the direct hit... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a sad situation, but the natural order of the law of the jungle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is simply a case of the absolute strong eliminating by violence those who stand in the way of its will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Dagruel was about to win - but Shion had a smile on his face. Shion&#39;s eyes caught the light of the magic circle shining at Dagruel&#39;s feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the next moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are the sweet one!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was released with a dignified cry that seemed to blow away the dust that had been flying around in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a scent as sweet as a rose, a radiantly beautiful girl in a jet-black dress appeared on stage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The silver-haired girl who fluttered down in front of Shion is the Demon Lord Luminas, the ruler of this land. She was staring at the Demon Lord Dagruel with her gold and silver heterochromia eyes, which held an intelligent will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, without a moment&#39;s delay, he completed the trap he had laid.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill009.jpg" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Perish! Sanctuary Disintegration!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sounds good to say that it is the crystallization of the prayers of the people of the Holy City, but in reality, it is the result of Demon Lord Luminas&#39; &quot;the Secret of Faith and Grace&quot; that has caused the Limit Break of the arithmetic domain. The reality is that Demon Lord Luminas had the power of the Holy Spirit of the congregation gathered by Limit Break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The more the number of believers, the more the power gathered becomes. It took some time, but it was well worth it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that the most powerful magic against individuals was made ranged was an astonishing feat. With the strongest &quot;Disintegration&quot; thus unleashed, even a giant like Charybdis could be obliterated in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel, who had been caught off guard, had nowhere to run but to be hit directly by the &quot;Sanctuary Disintegration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph, you let your guard down, Dagruel...a guy like you can make an opening just when you&#39;re proud of your victory...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was worried that Shion might be killed if Dagruel did not make an opening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how powerful Dagruel was, a direct hit of &quot;Disintegration&quot; would kill him. However, Dagruel&#39;s fighting aura? toki&#39;s defensive membrane was so thick that it was difficult to break through it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why they set up a maximized &quot;disintegration&quot; that could envelop Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas did not like the idea of hiding and watching, but he had no choice but to do so in order to win the war. Luminas had been watching the war situation for a long time, waiting for the right moment to strike.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His patience was rewarded with the best possible result.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t feel bad!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was so sure of his victory that he sent a handbill to Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a head-to-head battle between Luminas and Dagruel, Luminas&#39; chances of winning were very slim. Knowing this, Luminas did not consider it cowardly to carry out this strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She planned in advance so that she could win, and she would win. This was her way of life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She showed her most powerful blow against Dagruel, who had been caught off guard, without even showing her secret moves. It was a perfect strategy, and if this was not enough, there was no other way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why he said to Dagruel</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, it&#39;s true. I was careless, wasn&#39;t I? But there is no problem. Because I&#39;m not damaged. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-I freeze at his words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas&#39; clear mind correctly recognized the impossible reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Dagruel is really unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It clarifies only one fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is that all, Luminas? Then, it&#39;s my turn.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they fail to defeat Dagruel with their current attack, the Luminas will not win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Be careful! If you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll die immediately. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s declaration signaled the beginning of the time of despair.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle between Albert and Glassord was getting more and more fierce.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The area around them is wide open in a circle, as if they cannot afford to be caught in the middle of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this did not matter to them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They recognized each other as their rivals and were enjoying the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kuka kaka kaka! I am impressed with your skill. It&#39;s a credit to a warrior to be able to cross swords with a man like you!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s not my skill. It is this armor given to me by our god Rimuru-sama that is helping me. I would have been defeated by the pressure of your sword if I had remained the same. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Han! Don&#39;t be modest ! Few among the Titans can match me. The fact that you can master it proves that you are one of the best.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert coolly accepts Glassord&#39;s compliments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, it was Albert&#39;s ability to bring out the performance of the mythical-grade weapons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that Albert is not proud of it proves that he is not satisfied with his skill, and that he is not emotionally disturbed by the words of his enemies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Hmmm, that&#39;s a good point, isn&#39;t it?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord was also impressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a momentary battle, the one whose mind is disturbed loses. It is a fine tactic to deceive the enemy with words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, as if he were the next one, Glassord repeated his words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But why do you follow such a man?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If you&#39;ve built up that much strength, there&#39;s no need to follow a weak immortal king. It is true that necromancy is superior, but the true strength of a warrior is in his own body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chastises Albert as if he is trying to incite him, while wielding his two-handed greatsword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not mean what he said, but was speaking in order to provoke Albert to anger. Emotional turbulence induces mistakes, which immediately lead to death. This was also an honorable tactic of Glassord&#39;s. A true warrior would never have gone this far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert was not pleased to see a true warrior imitating him to this extent. And yet, his expression did not change at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are mistaken. It is true that I am Adalmann-sama&#39;s escort, the one in charge of the vanguard. But you&#39;re forgetting something, aren&#39;t you? Adalmann-sama is one of the 12 guardians of our God-approved-&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t you see? In other words, he&#39;s stronger than me.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert&#39;s attitude was one of matter-of-factness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Albert&#39;s own words were denied, Glassord muttered, &quot;Huh? and raises one eyebrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, he says nothing more, and holds his two-handed greatsword at the top of his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert knew that he was no match for his tricks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a pity, then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s not as it should be. I have found a wonderful opponent, but this battle is not a game. I have my own duties to perform, so it&#39;s time to get serious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord was not insulting Albert by cutting corners. He was fighting seriously for his life, even though he was enjoying a last-ditch fight by making full use of deceptive techniques.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now, when all the tricks of the trade had failed him, he had to put aside his obstinacy and defeat them head on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord made up his mind with a simple and clear thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord is a warrior by nature, and his skill level is that of a master. This is because he honed his skills without relying on his strength. This is the result of Glassord&#39;s desire, not because he lacked strength from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, he had locked away his power in his beloved two-handed greatsword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, it is released.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The change is instantaneous. The sword is now a part of Glassord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert has no way of knowing it, but Glassord&#39;s existence value, which was less than two million, has swelled to ten million.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Albert was blindsided by this change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I should have tried to win the game earlier, even if I had to....)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert thought bitterly as soon as he saw Glassord&#39;s swordsmanship. However, he knew it was a mistake. If he had done so, he would have been defeated before he saw Glassord&#39;s true spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is only one right answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to repeat the same fight as before, head-on and honestly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re not good enough for your opponent!&quot;No shortcomings!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s exactly what I say. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fierce sword fight begins again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert is overwhelmingly at a disadvantage. Like a willow that catches a storm, Albert can only fight against the fury of Glassord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Albert&#39;s eyes did not give up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle heats up, and soon the two of them are not paying attention to their surroundings, but only to their swords.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.ihv636"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slammed to the ground, Adalmann seems to have fainted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may have been a momentary event, but on the battlefield it is a fatal blunder. Grateful for his good fortune, Adalmann prioritizes his understanding of the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without going back to his memory of what happened, he understands that he was hit by Fenn&#39;s blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a desperate force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann survived because gehenna dragon Wenti protected him and together they took the impact. And the only reason why he was not chased down was because Ultima came to his rescue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But still, Fenn was the one to be feared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the &#39;Multilayer Barrier&#39; that Adalmann had put up was broken through, and only one defensive measure was effective. Without that defense, Adalmann would have been mortally wounded by a single blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(It is a strange expression to say that I, who am already dead, would have been mortally wounded. ) But still, I am a good magic &#39;Barrier&#39;, but this is more than a defeat...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann felt that he had been ignored.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, the remaining &#39;Barrier&#39; was not a magical one, but a protective coating by fighting aura? Without it, Adalmann&#39;s &#39;Barrier&#39; would not have been able to be used. Without it, Adalmann might have ascended to heaven.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it could be considered as a forceful push, it seemed more natural to think that Adalmann had been penetrated. Then, the secret of Fenn&#39;s power comes into view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well... I didn&#39;t think it was possible, but it does occur to me. ) It seems that the upper giants have &#39;magic nullification&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the answer Adalmann came up with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the same as Ultima&#39;s view, and it was the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann had already regarded it as the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would explain the low impact of the extreme magic and the fact that his own defenses were ignored.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I am wrong, so be it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann was not bothered by the fact that he did not have to use magic against the giants.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In any case, Adalmann&#39;s mana was already exhausted. It was difficult to use magic any more, so he was of the mind that it did not matter if the enemy was &#39;magic-disabled&#39; or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, who was supposed to be dying, stood up as if there was no problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every bone in his body is cracked and his holy robe is covered in mud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, Adalmann is unconcerned and looks at Fenn who is fighting against Ultima.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It&#39;s the Lady Ultima, isn&#39;t it? She seems to have already realized that her magic does not work. ) &quot;I&#39;m amazed that you managed to even the odds with such a big difference in power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be precise, they are not evenly matched, but they are only prolonging the game. Even a single direct hit would make Ultima unable to stand up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima has the audacity to attack repeatedly without fearing such a situation. It is precisely because of this that Ultima has been able to fight against an enemy whose existence value is twenty times greater than its own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the limit seems to be approaching.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann had no time to be complacent. The reason why he was not panicking was because he knew that he would be of no use to them if he continued on his way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mana is running out, and bones are dying - that is the word to describe Adalmann now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then there was something he should have done before going to the rescue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti, are you all right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I was caught off guard...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti quietly takes human form and answers Adalmann&#39;s question. She decides that the damage is too great and she should use her trump card to recover.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti can only activate his &#39;super recovery&#39; once a day by changing his physical configuration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From dragon form to human form, or vice versa. Either way, it allows him to ignore even mortal wounds. In this case, by transforming into human form, she was able to erase the intense damage she had taken on Adalmann&#39;s behalf.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann knows of this power, so he is not surprised and continues the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you for saving my life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all right.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now we have a problem. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sorry to say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn&#39;t seem to understand magic. If we don&#39;t do something, Miss Ultima will be in danger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn&#39;s energy level was so far out of the ordinary that it was reckless to challenge him in a straightforward manner. Adalmann&#39;s words came as a shock to Wenti, who had been thinking of using magic to cover him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, however, is unperturbed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is hard to believe that he used to be a priest. He looks at Fenn as if he were a researcher and says</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The giant is too strong. Even if magic could work, it would have been difficult to defeat it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann tells him plainly that this is true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their battle speed, destructive power, and defense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of them are first-rate, and their amount of energy alone is comparable to that of the &quot;True Dragon. Even if you attack it with a meager force, you will be crushed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, the same was true for Adalmann&#39;s magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, Adalmann says, we need to change course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh dear. It looks like it&#39;s time for my well-trained body to come out for the first time in a long time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti, who loves his master Adalmann, could not let his words go unanswered. He let out a questioning voice and asked, &#39;Did you hit your head? He has a crack in his head, is he conscious? Maybe he is not in his right mind? Maybe he is talking in his sleep while dreaming...&#39; He looks at Adalmann with suspicion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann has only bones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is a skeleton talking about?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if to answer Wenti&#39;s question, Adalmann says in a hawkish tone, &quot;I didn&#39;t say that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You didn&#39;t say that. I was a high priest, but my real job was something else. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, yes... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was actually a holy fist master... a position above that of a monk and a martial artist. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann didn&#39;t have to fight in close combat because he had Albert, who was a good bodyguard and could play the role of a vanguard. So, before he knew it, he had become a rearguard and a healer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was because it was more efficient, but it did not mean that Adalmann abandoned his skills. He is still active as a fist fighter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fighting aura? toki&#39;s defensive membrane saved his life was the proof of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;When I fought you, I didn&#39;t think it would be effective against you who are not humanoid, and I didn&#39;t have a chance to show you my techniques. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see...&quot; Wenti was at a loss for a response. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti was at a loss for a response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have known him for hundreds of years, but this is the first time I have heard this truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, if he had such a skill, I think he could have used it in more situations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Wenti, who admires Adalmann, had a few unacceptable stories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It seems that you are convinced. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, no. But, I mean...what? Wait a minute!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is there a problem?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, there&#39;s a lot going on, isn&#39;t there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, I see. What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti is at a loss to be asked such a question, but he has to ask this one question, so he starts to speak up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t think so, but are you planning to face that giant with your bare hands?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti asked, hoping for a denial.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have known Adalmann for a long time, but I have never seen him training his body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I don&#39;t even know if it makes sense for a skeleton to work out... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t care if he used to be a &quot;holy fist master&quot; or not... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn is too powerful an opponent to challenge with such uncertain information... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In short, Wenti is not interested in this challenge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, Adalmann was determined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;fufufu, it&#39;s a stupid question. You are a fist fighter, so it is natural that you use your bare hands, right? Do you still have doubts?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti wanted to retort, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that,&quot; but all he could say was, &quot;No, nothing....</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann&#39;s momentum was too much for Wenti.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I see. I understand that he was deceived by his former allies. Adalmann-sama looks intelligent, but he&#39;s not...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped thinking further and turned my eyes to the rampaging Fenn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, I have to trust in the Lord, my beloved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he doubted whether he really loved the Lord, Wenti decided to entrust everything to Adalmann.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Very well. I&#39;ll tell you what we&#39;re going to do. Magic doesn&#39;t seem to work, so we&#39;ll hit them with physics. This is the only way.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just hearing this, Wenti wants to go home. But he perseveres and listens to the next part of the plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course, your breath won&#39;t work either. Because the principle of &#39;magic nullification&#39; seems to be interfering with the spiritron itself, which makes up the magicule. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti was surprised to find Adalmann to be a dependable, if not quite decent, person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, what he said next was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;In other words, we have no means of attack. So, I have a proposal. Let&#39;s combine!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann&#39;s proposal was beyond Wenti&#39;s imagination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frankly speaking, it made no sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, Adalmann took Wenti&#39;s reply as an affirmative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;fufufu, I knew you would say so!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, no, no, no...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti&#39;s denial was too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, Adalmann, who did not listen to Wenti&#39;s words, did not waste any time in launching his technique.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ve been developing a secret technique for this kind of thing, and now I&#39;m going to show you!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti&#39;s body is weakening... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann invoked the ritual of &#39;assimilation by possession&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wonder how long he had been developing it, but it seems that the ritual succeeded without any problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann, a dead spirit, is as close to a spirit organism as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It can be said that he is possessed by his dead body, i.e., his skeleton.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By doing so, he can have an influence on this world, but the skeleton does not have to be his dependent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, Wenti was possessed by the skeleton.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This alone is not enough to be considered as a secret ritual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question was whether or not the consciousness would not be mixed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike possession that takes another person&#39;s body, it was necessary to protect the consciousness of the subject. It is precisely because Adalmann solved this problem that he is so proud to say that it is a secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rest assured. Your consciousness is still intact when you are possessed, isn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, yes... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I&#39;m a little worried about the separation later...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann murmurs quietly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti is not the kind of person who misses it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or rather, he can hear it perfectly because he is in the same body as Wenti.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wait, wait ! Are you sure you are OK?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann replies gently to Wenti&#39;s panicked voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Even in the worst case, let&#39;s ask our god Rimuru-sama to prepare a new body for us!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti thought that this was a brazen statement, but at least he would be allowed to say so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru loves experiments, and he would be very happy if I show him the result of this ritual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The more important question is which one of us will move to the new body - or even before that. Wenti has finally become aware of what his current state is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Adalmann possessed Wenti, his body had been transformed significantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The magicule of the gehenna dragon and the strong body that supports it. Adalmann&#39;s mentality of steel controls it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, this is a familiar sight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Standing there was a dark-haired young man in a jet-black priest&#39;s uniform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the young Adalmann.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although there were some differences, such as the color of his hair, it was a perfect reproduction of Adalmann&#39;s younger self.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this figure, Wenti thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;What? Surprisingly good-looking ! Adalmann-sama is a man to be respected ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Wenti is a cash cow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll leave the rest to you, Adalmann-sama.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti decided to trust Adalmann completely, forgetting about the anxiety she had been feeling until then. Thus, the true &quot;Gehenna Lord&quot; with a strong body and a huge amount of mana has descended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I am excited for the first time in a long time. In this condition, I might be able to compete with Zegion-dono. (Maybe, she is even with Miss Ultima.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann thinks so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann thinks back to his friends, who could not even exchange fists with him when he was a skeleton. Now, even if we don&#39;t win, the fight is still possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Yes, now...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from Benimaru, Diablo, and Zegion, Adalmann was confident that he would not be defeated by the other guardian kings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann smiled wryly and kicked the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His body is as light as if he were flying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even when he was a skeleton, he had never felt so free from gravity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, the giant Fenn is a formidable foe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was suicidal to take him for a fool, since Ultima was on the defensive against him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann alone would have been impossible to defeat. But if he had worked with Ultima... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fortunately, Fenn&#39;s power was real, but his skill level did not seem to be as high as that of Glassord, who was fighting against Albert. He could not handle the same level of energy as &quot;True Dragon&quot;, which is why he has not been able to finish off Ultima.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann thinks confidently, &quot;Then that&#39;s where we have a chance to win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s aim for a complete and overwhelming victory, not a tactical victory such as stalling for time!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann-sama is surely capable of that!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wenti also responded in a friendly manner, although he did not know where the basis for this was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an exchange of like minds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right! I am, we are one of Rimuru-sama&#39;s most powerful servants - the Twelve Guardians of the Sacred Demon!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This fact is the source of his confidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann and Wenti, both of them, run happily and laughingly in this critical situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Damn, I knew it! Ultima wanted to curse him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was bitterly convinced that Fenn could not work magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worst of all, the plan that Ultima and Luminas had made was to eliminate Dagruel with the most powerful &quot;Disintegration&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though I wanted to tell him that this was not the way to go, Fenn was not so naive as to allow me to do so. In the end, Ultima saw the light pillar of &quot;Disintegration&quot; shining in the distance, and realized that the mission had failed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;There are some insectoids that can nullify magic, but not this one...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;haha haha ! You noticed. Our &#39;magic nullifier&#39; is an anti-anti-magic guard. It blocks the movement of spiritron itself, so no matter what kind of magic we use, it won&#39;t work!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s very kind of you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima replies with annoyance and sarcasm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Giants were also natural enemies for demons, whose strongest weapon is magic. It seems to be a characteristic of only the higher species, but their compatibility was so bad that it was almost laughable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Guy definitely knew this . Guy definitely knew this. He should have told us...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) I complain, but Guy is not here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was now that Ultima understood from the bottom of her heart the importance of &quot;Reporting (Ho), Contacting (Len), and Consulting (Sou)&quot; that Rimuru always talked about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is too late for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had to find some way to attack the problem, because I could not give up at this point. Ultima realized that the clue was in the &quot;Nihilistic Parade&quot; that Gadra was using.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(The reason why the old man went out of his way was because it was dangerous. Why is that?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Needless to say, the answer is: because it works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has to do with the nature of magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magic rewrites the laws by influencing magicule, and since spiritron is included in magicule, it is inevitable that &#39;magic nullification&#39; becomes an anti-magic guard. However, if it is a nihilistic magic among dark magic, it is considered that even &#39;magic nullification&#39; can&#39;t nullify it, since it summons infernal nihilism and makes the energy it contacts vanish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was already a certainty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima did not hesitate to limit its attack to nihilism.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Die, dark magic: nihilistic vanishing hell! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima&#39;s nihilism attacked Fenn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn, he&#39;s a pain in the ass. Demons are really good at harassing us!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fenn&#39;s fighting aura? toki drowns out the emptiness, but fails to do any damage. Nihilistic Banish&quot; is the most powerful dark magic as a counterpart of &quot;Disintegration&quot;, but to Fenn it means nothing more than harassment. .</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, it was not meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as a cloud of dust makes a mountain, just as a drop of water can pierce a rock, repeated attacks would bring Fenn down one day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was plenty of time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima searched for the path to victory and became more and more focused. They would repeat their attacks thousands and thousands of times with such precision that not even a single mistake would be allowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Fenn&#39;s attack hits even once, Ultima will be defeated. That&#39;s how big the gap is, but... However, the speed, the most important factor in the battle, was not so different between Ultima and Fenn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why the battle between Ultima and Fenn was successful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is another reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the difference in combat experience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima had been trained in combat against Zegion, an overwhelmingly strong opponent. This was the reason why Ultima and Zegion were more familiar with how to handle themselves against a strong opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The difference in existence values between Ultima and Zegion is not twice as great. You would think that Fenn, with a difference of more than 20 times, would be more dangerous, but this was not the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To use an analogy, Zegion&#39;s attack is like a spear. Insta-kill, and if you are pierced, you die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Fenn&#39;s attack was like a huge hammer. It had great power, and even a single hit would do a great deal of damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the difference is only between a point and a surface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The threat level is the same, as long as the amount of energy required to kill the enemy is exceeded. Fenn&#39;s attack is more powerful, but it is no different from Zegion&#39;s in that it will kill you anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was easier to feel better if we could make up our minds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was worried about Luminas, but I had already given up on them. There was nothing I could do by worrying about them, so I had already driven them out of my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima even regained the luxury of humming and started to play with Fenn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Adalmann came back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Miss Ultima, sorry to keep you waiting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who&#39;s that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ha-ha-ha, it&#39;s Adalmann!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, well. You know what you have to do, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course I do!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the high-speed communication by Thought Acceleration, the division of roles between the two was instantly determined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann is in the vanguard against Fenn, and Ultima is in the follow-up to reduce Fenn&#39;s strength with dark magic: nihilistic vanishing hell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After this point, the rest is just work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;A rampaging boy with only physical strength is no match for us, is he? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultima tells us with a wicked sneer, though it is a premature declaration of victory.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The earth trembled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The absolute fury of the Demon Lord Dagruel dominated the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I honestly felt that this was impossible for Demon Lord Luminas Valentine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His plan was to get rid of Dagruel by using the most powerful secret secret technique in the first attack. When it did not work, the defeat was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Disintegration, which returns any opponent to dust, would have killed Dagruel. Even the &quot;True Dragon&quot; would have to be reborn after his life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, the result was disastrous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s &#39;magic nullification&#39; was a foul trait, completely destroying any chance of victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that point, Luminas had half-expected this to happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle between Albert and Glassord continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first glance, the battle seemed to be evenly matched, with neither side giving an inch. However, if you observe their battle through the Ultimate Skill &#39;Lustful King (Asmodeus)&#39;, the situation shows a different aspect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The light of Glassord shines brightly, while Albert&#39;s light is so thin that it seems to disappear at any moment. Although the amount of life force that each player could cut was very small, the difference in the total amount of life force implied the victory or defeat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Albert could cut down Glassord, the winner was decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Albert lost the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, we should not blame Albert for this. On the contrary, Albert should be praised for his great swordsmanship in the match against the King of Swords.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glassord is also a master of sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we consider the difference in energy as a handicap, we can say that Albert&#39;s skill (level) is superior to Glassord&#39;s. However, it is not enough to change the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is not enough to change the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, Albert&#39;s defeat was only a matter of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, the Ultimas were giving Fenn a good fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle was getting more and more fierce, but it was already a game of attrition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was impressed by the way Rimuru&#39;s subordinates were doing so well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann and others were integrated with gehenna dragon Wenti, although the circumstances are unknown. Thanks to this, he seems to have gained a strong body and the amount of magicule has increased significantly, but even so, against Fenn, who is a &quot;mad fist&quot; comparable to a &quot;True Dragon&quot;, the difference is obvious. Ultima, in particular, has been a long-time favorite of the &quot;True Dragon&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially Ultima, who had been tormenting Luminas for a long time, left us with a lot of impressions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, I felt a sense of admiration for him, but at the same time, I also felt a sense of bitterness that he is still a troublesome guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas is a complicated case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Luminas, whose vitality can be quantified, the gap between the two seemed to be hopelessly wide. And yet, they did not give up, and even showed a margin of enjoyment in the fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this was based on his mental concentration, as if he was treading on thin ice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Luminas&#39; vision, he saw Adalmann, who had abandoned his whole body defense and concentrated his energy only at the point of contact to cope with Fenn&#39;s attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same is true of Ultima. Ultima is more stable than Adalmann because it manages its energy more naturally, but it still ends with a single blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To make up for the difference in energy density, he concentrates all his power in one point. It was such an amazing feat that it could be called divine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this technique does not last for a long time, and a momentary lapse of guard can be fatal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, the main objective is to wear down the enemy in a prolonged battle, so it is needless to say how hopeless it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a miracle that the battle was even fought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Fenn does not make use of Gleipnir. When it was in full force, it seemed to change the whole situation of the war.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, there was Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion, who had been beaten down in front of Luminas, was getting up again to challenge Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was determined not to retreat, no matter how many times he was beaten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it was a feat of valor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The difference in fighting ability between Dagruel and Shion is so great that Luminas, who could read it in the numbers, cannot see anything but recklessness in Shion&#39;s actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion is alive because he was under the protection of Luminas. Otherwise, he would have died almost certainly immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if Shion has an immortal body, if he is not given a chance to regenerate, he will lose his body. Although it is possible to regenerate from the soul, if one loses not only the material body but also the spiritual body, the exposed astral body as well as the &quot;heart core&quot; would be shattered and one would die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas prevent this from happening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas wipes his cold sweat as he watches over Shion, &quot;Don&#39;t do anything rash.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s sons were in a panic to stop Shion, who was upset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, Miss! You can&#39;t do it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion-sama! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shion-sama! I knew it...&quot; &quot;Oh, no! We&#39;d better run away... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Shion won&#39;t be cowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shut up ! Rimuru-sama will not be defeated. I mean, I won&#39;t be defeated either!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas thought that this was a very unorthodox logic, but it was typical of Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And perhaps his words had made even Dagruel&#39;s sons come alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dad ! We&#39;re against them!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;ve got no choice. I&#39;m ready!&quot;Let&#39;s do it!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;ll do it! And we&#39;ll get the praise!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was determined, as he said, and went toward Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well? You have grown up to be able to stand in front of me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel seemed to be happy, but he did not seem to have any intention to take it easy on them, and the next moment the three of them were knocked down. They were so badly injured by a single blow that they could not even stand up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were still alive, so I guess they had been treated with a little bit of pressure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;This is impossible. (This is impossible. There is no way we can win...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas, who had reached a state of resignation, heard Shion&#39;s roar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;fufufu, good job, you guys! That was good spirit. I&#39;ll take care of the rest, and you can rest there!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion himself had been badly injured by Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he has already healed, the difference in strength between the two is still too great to overcome... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, Shion stands up and does not give up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His appearance reminded me of a very old scene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It reminded him of the Hero who had saved Luminas in the past.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let me help you!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra said and followed Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there was no point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion and his team&#39;s attacks could not reach Dagruel, and they could not even touch him.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the crossroads of the decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They could continue to fight toward defeat, or they could run away from the game and try to regain their footing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wise man would not have to choose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, it is true...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, the old Luminas would have retreated without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no point in fighting a war that cannot be won.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The country can be rebuilt, and there is no reason to remain here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no need for the Luminas, who have an eternal life span, to fight a life-and-death battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Are you sure about this? Is it really right for I (Ruminas voice) to abandon Shion?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas is unsure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Dagruel is after Luminas, there is a better chance that Shion and the others will be saved if Luminas leaves now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought so, but he also understood that this was an excuse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He could not lie to his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion would not give up, just as Ultima and Adalmann continued to challenge Fenn. However, since there was no way to win, Shion&#39;s death was certain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what if Luminas had cooperated?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Luminas has the Ultimate Skill &#39;Lustful King (Asmodeus)&#39;, he controls &quot;life and death&quot;. Even if they die instantly, they can be resurrected with Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Luminas retreats now, Shion will surely die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Abandoning his friends, and only I (Ruminas voice) would run away? I refuse to accept such an ungrateful way of life ! I (Ruminas voice) am the proud &quot;Queen of Nightmares&quot; ! (Ruminas voice)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas, too, has made up his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gunther!</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Here! </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.32hioqz"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas calls out, and Gunther Strauss, his butler-like confidant, appears like a shadow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas does not turn his head, but instead commands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I (Ruminas voice) am a proud Octagram, and I intend to share the fate of Shion here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What if I choose to run away?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no shame in running away, Gunther advises.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas, however, laughs it off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Running away in disgrace is not worthy of I (Ruminas voice), don&#39;t you think? Don&#39;t you think so?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saying this, she gave a glamorous smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a fascinating smile that did not match the appearance of a beautiful girl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gunther was deeply convinced and remembered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, he had smiled like this when he buried some god ancestor a long time ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas has always clung to life, but only to keep her promise to her friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is, in her essence, a proud queen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Queen of Nightmares&quot; Luminas Valentine is not one to run away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The noble vampire princess is the ultimate mikoshi for Gunther and his friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gunther bowed reverently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas nodded in return and said, &quot;If I (Ruminas) am a vampire princess, I (Ruminas) am a goddess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If I (Ruminas voice) should perish, you may lead your people as the next king. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas&#39; declaration was filled with determination and resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, Gunther remained calm and unmoved. If it is the steward who obeys the Lord, Gunther is unmistakably the apostle of Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What is a subject if he forsakes his king? Not a single one of Luminas-sama&#39;s men would be foolish enough to follow such a man. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The evacuation of the people has already begun, but I&#39;m willing to follow you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Mnh-mnh...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was puzzled by this unexpected defiance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first time, Gunther, who had been his loyal servant, disobeyed Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time of destruction will be with you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gunther answered, waiting for Luminas&#39; reply with a look of unwavering determination in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was puzzled, but he was soon amused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph, do as you please,&quot; he commanded happily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he commanded happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whoever he is like, he&#39;s a fool,&quot; Luminas says, smiling happily.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Godspeed.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gunther bowed and left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had decided that he was no match for Dagruel, so he went to help Louis first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas is impressed that he is as capable as ever. Luminas then stood next to Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas wonders if he did the right thing, but he has no regrets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It seems that your plan has failed, but you still do not give up, do you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course not.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas nodded his head in disgust, but in the next moment, he grinned and asked again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyway, Shion, are you sure you don&#39;t want to run away?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was miffed at this question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The last one standing is the winner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Isn&#39;t that a very simple condition?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion says glumly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra&#39;s head hurt, but she did not seem to have any intention to argue with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was just as puzzled as Gadra and Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then leave the recovery to I (Ruminas voice). Even if you die instantly, I will bring you back to life on the spot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these words as a cue, they launch a suicide attack that could be called reckless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion and Gadra attack in waves, with Luminas providing support in the rear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Shion and Gadra were instantly killed by Dagruel&#39;s attack, Luminas really revived them. The power of the &#39;Lustful King (Asmodeus)&#39; is to be feared, but Luminas&#39; precise measures are also impressive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then there is Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to her reincarnation as a mysterious race of metal demon, she was able to fight a good battle even against Dagruel, whose magic was not understood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Dagruel&#39;s &#39;magic nullification&#39; is universal, but it is not without its weaknesses. It seems to be able to cancel all the magic that affects itself, but not all the magic that affects other people&#39;s bodies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Body reenforcement magic is a good example. In other words, defense barriers and body hardening can be ignored, but already reinforced speed and so on remain unchanged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adalmann&#39;s &quot;Tempest Me-Teare&quot;, for example, was erased because the summoned meteorite was an imaginary substance, but if it had been a real substance, it would have caused a certain amount of damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we assume that a rock of a certain mass was stored in a different space, and then it was sent up to the sky by flight magic, and then it was dropped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would be impossible to cancel the potential energy given to the rock. In other words, Gadra&#39;s reasoning was that indirect magic cannot be canceled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra had applied reinforcement magic to his body to fight skillfully. It worked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Shion was down, Gadra moved forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Gadra was knocked down, Shion quickly took over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it was an improvised combination, they worked well together as if they were an experienced party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the most important thing was undoubtedly Luminas&#39; authority, it was a strategy that would not have been possible without any of the other players.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, Dagruel showed no sign of fatigue. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In front of Luminas, Shion stands up again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how much he is hurt, he stands up again and again, even at the risk of death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a man of integrity, doing only what he can do for himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is trust in Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He believed that Luminas would bring him back to life even from instant death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forgive me for saying so, but it is naive and simple. That was the great thing about Shion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this is not the case with Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as she recovers from her near-death experience, all her injuries are healed and not even a trace remains. At first glance, it seems as if nothing had happened to her because she is unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the exhaustion is accumulating in Gadra&#39;s mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Shion, Gadra was intelligent enough to think about how hopelessly they were fighting, even if they tried not to think about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This kind of battle can only be fought with an empty mind. The moment we become conscious of our fears and doubts, we trigger a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And moreover, the opponent was Dagruel. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The demon lord, who has the same amount of magicule as Fenn, but a little less than Glassord, has acquired a solid skill (level). He is the most dangerous of the three brothers in terms of overall strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Gadra wonders if he should stay as he is, or if I can do better.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gadra wonders if he can do better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) This is a fatal mistake, and Gadra&#39;s action is a little delayed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a minor delay that could not be called a mistake, but Dagruel was not so naive as to miss the opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, on the contrary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was correct to say that he had been overlooking it until now, but he decided not to go along with it any more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh dear, I thought you&#39;d be more entertaining, but I guess I&#39;m disappointed...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a big sigh, Dagruel randomly punched Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naturally, Luminas healed him immediately, but Dagruel intervened with a surprising move and prevented him from doing so.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel stands between Luminas and Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas could not recover from this situation, because Dagruel interfered with his recovery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Am I in your way? I could have done this from the beginning, but I thought I&#39;d see more variety in your moves, so I let you do what you wanted. I don&#39;t expect you to thank me, but it&#39;s not right to hold a grudge against me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s words are true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the very beginning, Dagruel has always been accommodating. By doing so, Dagruel was trying to enjoy the fight as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is convinced that he will not lose when he makes a move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s power was that great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, he gave the Luminas a chance because he remembered the words of his best friend, Twilight Valentine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She is, you know, my masterpiece. Unlike my other works, she is full of possibilities. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gods had always boasted to Dagruel in this way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The abilities of Gods&#39; disciples were quite good, but only Luminas was treated differently from the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Dagruel&#39;s eyes, there seemed to be no difference. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, the godfather passed away without ever telling us why.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, he died without telling us the reason for his death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The &quot;Sanctuary Disintegration&quot; mentioned earlier is the special magic that buried the ancestor. However, even this did not work on Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed as if there was no such thing as a &quot;deep trick&quot; anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, Dagruel himself was playing along with the game, trying to see the power of his opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it did not seem to make sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was supporting the team and showed no sign of joining in the attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to show him an opening several times, but he just kept repeating the same pattern of attacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;No matter how many times I repeat such childish tricks, it is impossible for me to be defeated...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel felt that he had been underestimated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So he decided that there was no point in going out with them any more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this does not mean that he stopped his vigilance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a rational decision to divide the vanguard and the rear guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You sound as if you were holding back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was indignant and pressed Dagruel, but Dagruel brushed it off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you...?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm. You don&#39;t understand well enough.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel disappears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next moment, Shion is silenced by a fist that slams into his abdomen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is as if his insides have exploded. It was not a cute rage that would disappear immediately, but it continued to rage as if it was running through Shion&#39;s internal organs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(In this case, restoration magic is meaningless...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion felt so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, with the destructive energy remaining there, no matter how much he could restore it, it would be meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas saw it at a glance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a problem,&quot; he regrets as he bites his lip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you think? You must have felt so secure with your protector, didn&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Gosh, what the hell...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re not beaten yet? Your determination is admirable... but determination alone is not enough...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel kicked Shion in the face in an uninterested manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel has nothing against Shion, but rather likes him. He was going to use this to harvest his consciousness so that he would not be disturbed any more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, I guess I underestimated Shion&#39;s stubbornness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, stop laughing! This won&#39;t be enough to defeat me...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion stood up with a wry smile on his face while spitting up blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m getting old as an old geezer. I apologize for misjudging you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had intended to stun him so that he wouldn&#39;t kill him, but that didn&#39;t stop Shion. Realizing this, Dagruel stopped being so easy on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You would have been a little better off if you had woken up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel says to Shion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What are you talking about?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s none of your business. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if in a final gesture, Dagruel dismisses the question. He clenched his fists.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas sees this and shouts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, stop!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas sensed the change in Dagruel and knew that Shion was in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Dagruel snickers at Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He will die because of your inadequacy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion tried to argue, but was silenced again by Dagruel&#39;s blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is not dead, but he is unconscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shion was lucky to survive, and Dagruel did not go easy on him, but he could not continue the fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel is relieved that Shion has fainted, as he did not want to hurt him, nor did he want to kill him if possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, only Luminas and Dagruel were left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas finally makes up his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Very well. Dagruel, we will fight one on one. I (Ruminas voice) will deal with him!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas took a stance toward Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He feels funny inwardly at his own words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although he was proud of his position as a demon lord, he thought that Luminas was nothing more than a piece of dust to Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmmm. Luminas, show me what Twilight has entrusted you with. If you can&#39;t do it, then die!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next moment, Dagruel&#39;s entire body erupted in a furious fighting aura? toki gushed out from Dagruel&#39;s body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this, Luminas realized how much he had been treated by Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel was not aware that he was being held back, but if he had been in this condition from the beginning, the game would have been settled long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;He really is a monster. (He really is a monster, isn&#39;t he? ) There is no effective way to deal with him, and the only possibility is to wait for Rimuru to come to his rescue...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the secret plan has failed, there is no way to win a head-to-head battle with Dagruel. And yet, Luminas is standing here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, he wondered if he should have run away, but Luminas laughed and said that was not the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What kind of demon lord abandons his friend Shion, Luminas thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I wonder. (It&#39;s a wonder. I haven&#39;t known Shion as long as I&#39;ve known Chloe...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) I did not want to fail Shion and his friends, and that is why I am still standing here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Rimuru is in a tough situation. He always worked harder than his ability to meet the expectations of his colleagues.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first time, Luminas understood Rimuru&#39;s feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except for Guy, Rimuru was the only one who could beat Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or maybe...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas had a vision of a free-spirited black dragon in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It&#39;s just my imagination. It&#39;s impossible that I (Ruminas voice) would expect him to do that!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Contrary to such a thought, a smile naturally appeared on Luminas&#39; mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel looked at Luminas with a curious expression on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;At this late stage, do you still have any more tricks up your sleeve?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, if I had such a trick, I would have used it long ago!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas bragged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least for the last time, he would not run away, but would challenge the strong and defend his pride as a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(-Maybe, I (Ruminas voice) also believe in this? Maybe someone will help us this time, just like in the past...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the past crisis, Chloe helped us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a miraculous event and it can&#39;t happen again and again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas knows that there is no such a thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they think like that because they have been inspired by the way Shion and Ultima have kept their hope alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It must be so, Luminas thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(It&#39;s really tough, isn&#39;t it, Rimuru? (It&#39;s really tough on Rimuru, isn&#39;t it? ) Even people who have nothing to do with Rimuru, such as myself (Ruminas voice), can&#39;t help but get their hopes up...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was strange that I could laugh at the thought of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;-? Have you come up with a plan?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, I don&#39;t. It&#39;s not like me (Ruminas voice), but I&#39;m going to try to struggle to the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">huh? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well then, let&#39;s go!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a strong spirit, Luminas opened his mana to full throttle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, he imbues his night rose with the power of the &#39;Lustful King (Asmodeus)&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was Luminas&#39; deadly and victorious fighting style, in which he used his power of &quot;death&quot; to take away the opponent&#39;s life force, and used his power of &quot;life&quot; to convert it into his own energy. In this state, Luminas was able to kill his opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this state, a slight difference in strength is not a problem, and the longer the battle goes on, the more advantageous it becomes. In the case of a battle between two higher-ranked fighters whose main objective is to drain the energy of their opponents, Luminas is quite superior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing such Luminas, Dagruel was also satisfied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;They are wonderful, even though they are our enemies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were wonderful people in every way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they were our allies, they were reliable, and now that they were our enemies, they made Dagruel&#39;s heart soar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Really, it&#39;s a shame to kill them.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he has to avenge the man who was his best friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By doing so, Dagruel can fulfill his destiny as a &quot;god-killer&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the secret agreement he made with Feldway through Fenn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel cooperates with Feldway&#39;s ambition and revives Veldanava. After that, the real work begins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, the secret agreement with Feldway did not end there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Luminas is defeated, the entire western lands will be under the control of the giants. If the Great Jura Forest was overrun, the land would also belong to Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s true intention was &#39;I can&#39;t stop here&#39; because he would be able to fulfill his destiny and satisfy his territorial ambition. Before that, his instincts had already started to run wild.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel decided that there was no need for further farce.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;In the first place...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel begins to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, everything stands still.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All meaning had been lost in the act of fighting on this battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Once you&#39;ve done this, you can&#39;t do anything, can you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is all that Dagruel mutters, echoing through the world and fading away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;-!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas was puzzled in the world where only consciousness remained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, he&#39;s conscious. He must be proud of his masterpiece!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s &quot;voice&quot; sounded like praise, but a soul-chilling fear struck Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas is wise and well versed in all things. Normally, he would have overlooked it, but now that he was focused on the battle, he understood what was going on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understood.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-Time has stopped.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is despair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;From the beginning, there was no way to beat Dagruel...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he understood this, Luminas&#39; thirst for life was not lost under the circumstances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gathers information in order to survive, and this leads him to further despair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas continues to claw his way back, despite the illusion of being swallowed by a bottomless darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Suspended World, even the time of despair is not over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas closes his eyes and regrets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(At least, I can take that hateful and irreverent evil dragon with my hands...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when Luminas had thought that much, he thought he heard a loud laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas thought that he heard a loud laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the moment when Dagruel&#39;s fist was about to reach Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas&#39; thought paused there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m here!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Luminas understood the meaning of the voice, and at the same time, he grasped the current situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A mighty fist looms in front of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And a brown palm to catch it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The evil dragon who had not been here before was catching Dagruel&#39;s fist that was shot at Luminas.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill010.jpg" src="images/image30.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-As there is no night that does not dawn, time moves with the coming of hope.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, just now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The evil dragon that had leapt through time and space, the invincible Veldora, whom Luminas hated but longed for, had blocked Dagruel&#39;s attack, which had been hopelessly powerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The time of despair had come to an end.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.1hmsyys"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-012.png" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.2grqrue"></a><a id="id.41mghml"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-013.png" src="images/image20.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.vx1227"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Time has rewound since Veldora&#39;s arrival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took a &#39;Spatial Transportation&#39; to the old Eurazania region to stop Milim&#39;s rampage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The area where Velzard is covered with ice and snow is too difficult to reach directly due to poor visibility.

Milim, use your power to destroy the tree!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were not only Milim and Velzard but also Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, the presence of Feldway is so different from that of Milim and Velzard that one wonders if it is really Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has an overwhelming presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was so overwhelming that I doubted if I could win even if I were to fight seriously now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And for some reason, he was giving orders to Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Milim, however, has undergone a terrible change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was unclear and deformed in the video, but up close, its horror was obvious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On its back was a pair of jet-black wings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A single red horn sprouted from its forehead, shining in rainbow colors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bare skin except for the face was covered with hard dragon scales shining in dull tones with mysterious patterns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wondered if this was Milim in his &#39;stumpy state&#39;, and at the same time, I sensed a power that almost made me tremble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Lord Milim, who manifested as an incarnation of absolute destruction, was truly worthy of being called a &quot;Destroyer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why is such a Milim being ordered to do something?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What in the world is going on?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&quot;Regalia&quot; is the title of the Ultimate Skill &#39;Justice King (Michael)&#39;. Dominion.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It seems </span><span class="c3">that Feldway has succeeded in taking control of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Milim.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wait a minute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does this mean that Milim, which is running amok, is not so bad, and Feldway is using it as a pawn ?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s not even the worst part... </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">Fortunately, we don&#39;t feel that we are in complete control. Even if Feldway turns the entire arithmetic domain over to Milim&#39;s control, it seems to be able to issue only simple commands</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no, that&#39;s still more than enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lucky for you, they didn&#39;t order you to kill me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway was not happy about our presence, but he had no intention of fighting us here. He didn&#39;t care about us, he just gave the order to Milim and left.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Milim </span><span class="c3">&#39;s rule is unstable, so</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;he may not be flexible. </span><span class="c3">Or maybe they want to prioritize the destruction of the tree</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does this mean that Feldway&#39;s power cannot revoke the order once it is given?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is quite possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shudder just to think of Milim making an attempt on my life. We should be glad that it didn&#39;t happen, but we never thought it would.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It </span><span class="c3">was completely unexpected</span><span class="c0">. I guess the </span><span class="c3">runaway state of the machine has made it lose its power of resistance...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knew that Feldway had the power to control the system, but I had not considered the possibility that Milim might be manipulated. I can&#39;t blame Ciel-san alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the first place, Milim must have been very strong against the dominant power. He always said that such a power would not work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was thought that they would never have succeeded in dominating if they had not run amok.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, that&#39;s what they wanted... </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If we </span><span class="c3">let Milim run amok, the world is in danger of collapsing</span><span class="c0">. But to </span><span class="c3">remove that worry with Regalia Dominion... it&#39;s too bad a gamble</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Ciel-san is so vague about it, it might have been a plan that would hardly succeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frankly, it would be crazy to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&#39;s the case, there&#39;s no point in worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More importantly, what is this &quot;divine tree&quot; that Feldway had set as Milim&#39;s goal?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">It is a divine tree that protects the capital of Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty of Sarion.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is a </span><span class="c3">tree large enough to hold even a huge city, and seems to play a role in stabilizing the magicule of this world and preventing natural disasters</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san answers my question smoothly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is as knowledgeable and dependable as ever, but what he just said is something I can&#39;t miss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have never been to Sarion, but the capital of that country was in a tree - but not there. I can only have a vague image, but if the capital is in the tree, it would be a disaster if the tree is destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have no other choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is impossible...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we could not do that, we had to at least buy enough time to evacuate the residents, or else it would be a catastrophe for sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, hey, this is a messy situation...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy said as if he was a stranger to the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not a child&#39;s essay, you should have something more substantial to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you have something to complain about?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, I don&#39;t. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want to complain to them that I don&#39;t need such a presence detection, but I&#39;m of the mindset that the long haul will get the short end of the stick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pulled out of the situation so that he could do his best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, not appreciating my response, complains in a disgusted tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But that son of a bitch Feldway... he&#39;s as nasty as ever. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m talking about whether it turned out to be a good thing that I let you take me for a ride.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Guy said that, I understood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I finally got Guy to move by persuading him to come here, but if Guy had not come here because he was too worried about Ivarage&#39;s attack, it would have been a dead end at that point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy was able to deal with Velzard, and I was able to deal with Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it had been just me... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oops, I don&#39;t care about such hypotheticals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no time to dawdle. Because Milim is on the move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy naturally went in front of Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to go after Milim after I called Eltan, but for some reason, I couldn&#39;t get through to his cell phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had a bad feeling that he was busy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had no choice but to track Milim while contacting Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I try desperately to catch up with Milim while connecting &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; to Benimaru, and try to attract his attention by attacking him. However, Milim does not care about my attacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know it&#39;s not a serious attack, but it&#39;s a very powerful one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no time to lament.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s roar was enough to trigger a mysterious burst of power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The principle was probably that the vibration of the sound of his voice interfered with and broke the molecular bonds. I managed to escape, but the river dried up in the aftermath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is too risky to mess with Milim. I thought so, but I knew that the collapse of Sarion was imminent if I didn&#39;t do something about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt Benimaru and I were connected by a &#39;thought&#39; as I wondered what I was going to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39; </span><span class="c3">ve made a plan, though the probability of success is low</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no more time to hesitate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the extraordinary speed of flight, dozens of times faster than the speed of sound, they were very close to reaching Sarion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if the success rate of the mission was low, I had no choice but to bet on Ciel-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I came to the same conclusion as usual, and though I had my doubts, I informed Benimaru of the situation and ordered him to carry out the operation.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty of Sarion was in an unprecedented and unprecedented crisis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Against this backdrop, the Celestial Elmesia asked her mother, Silvia, in an easygoing tone of voice, without losing her normal, nonchalant demeanor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, is Lim going to come?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, he can&#39;t. Demon Lord Milim seems to have gone berserk and he&#39;s on his way to stop him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No way!&quot;No way! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia could not hide her surprise that the situation had turned out to be more troublesome than she had imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;By the way, it seems that Velzard the Frost Dragon was the cause of the trouble, and he even moved the Demon Lord Guy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s easy to say that they moved him, but only Rimuru could do such a thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Knowing this, Elmesia had no choice but to let it slide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that is not the way it should be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the moment, the capital of Sarion, the city embraced by the tree of God, has been turned into a hell by the onslaught of Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only Jahil, but there was even a man who called himself &quot;General of the Three Stars&quot; Zalario, and the scene was in chaos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;ve reinforced it to the limit with the defense mechanism of the divine tree, but it&#39;s still no use at this point...&quot; said Elmesia with her head held high. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia was worried about the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magus is mobilizing all of his forces to deal with the situation, but one after another they are being shot down. But Elmesia thinks it&#39;s great that they haven&#39;t been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sarion is proud of its Magus, a group of high-ranking military officers who are also called &quot;knights of pure blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are the full-authority agents of the Celestials and are qualified as mediators.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are considered to be the supreme force of the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty of Sarion, composed only of those who are ancestors of old blood, but in reality, they are &#39;knights of pure blood&#39;. The reality is that they are a group of knights composed of those who are compatible with a weapon called the &#39;magic knight&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, this &#39;Mageki&#39; - commonly known as &#39;Meigas&#39; - is a state secret. The reason why they are called by the same name is to protect the secret from being leaked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The overall height is about 5 meters. It has an exterior made of magical steel and is driven by dragon muscle fibers. It is an intelligence weapon that possesses a will and searches for its own match.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The essence of this weapon can only be displayed when it is in the state of being a rider. Just as the mastery of spirit users is to assimilate with spirits, this &#39;magic rider&#39; is also designed to release its power only when the rider rides it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Usually, the &#39;magic rider&#39; is stored in a magical jewel, which is made into a necklace or a bracelet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a side note, Kabal and Gido also possessed one. When they were confronted with the runaway Ifrit at the place where they first met Rimuru and his friends, they were ready to activate their Meigas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, activating MAYGAS in another country would be a crime of confidentiality leakage, and would surely be a liability for Elalude duke. Besides, it was unknown whether they would be able to defeat Ifrit even if they launched Maygas. They were fighting in the flesh, judging that they did not need to use maygas if they were just going to protect Elen and let him escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The real strength of Kabal and Gido was equivalent to A rank, and their fighting ability did not change enough to be doubled even if they were mounted on magas. This is also the reason why Elalude duke chose them as Elen&#39;s guards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As you can see, the fighting abilities of each individual vary widely, and there are those who are weak in the flesh, but are unbeatable when they are in the state of being a rider. The combat ability of such &#39;Meigas&#39; is at least equivalent to a special A rank. About 300 of them were facing the enemy in a squadron.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I didn&#39;t know we had so many Meigas. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;ve been working hard on it, you know.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thirteen royal families of Sarion usually quarrel with each other, but this time, they seem to have united in unison and put their forces into battle without sparing any effort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Elmesia had intended to abandon the project since it would have been irredeemable if they had rebelled against it. It is a blessing in disguise that this did not happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Be that as it may, the conversation between Elmesia and Silvia continues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;There was a golem development going on at Lim&#39;s place, too, so we&#39;re going to lose our advantage in no time,&quot; she said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If that happens, you&#39;re going to propose joint development, aren&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I guess so. Rimu is sensible and we agree that we don&#39;t want to let dangerous forces out of the country, so I think they&#39;ll try to limit the number and distribute it among them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was surprised at how open he was, despite his usual secrecy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This surprised even the heavy hitters who had been listening, but that is because they are both escaping from reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even now, another Magus ace has been dropped. Even such an ace-class knight, whose existence value is estimated to be over 500,000, cannot even buy enough time against Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides Jahil, there were other notable generals in the enemy&#39;s army.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario goes without saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dhalis and Nice, who were under his command, had also achieved remarkable results in the war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had taken on flesh as undead elf, and had destroyed Magus with great power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s a big loss!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia complains, but she does not really mean it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The survival of the nation is more important than money. They have to hold out until reinforcements arrive, and that will be difficult as it is. Such calculations only make me feel like complaining.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I guess we&#39;ll just have to make do,&quot; Silvia said resignedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia said with a resigned look on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, the strongest in all of Sarion are the mother and daughter of Silvia and Elmesia. The reason they were standing by was because they had been recalled by the elders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, your majesty! Silvia-sama, please be careful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your Highness. If we had a chance to win, but this time we&#39;re up against too bad an opponent. I won&#39;t allow it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even the eldest members of the council had come out and interfered with the two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was out of concern for their safety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Few people know that Silvia is a shadow of Elmesia. In fact, even the thirteen royal families do not know about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, this time, the appearance of both of them at the same time created chaos at the scene. Even so, the strength of the two was no match for that of Magus, the wielder of the &#39;magic rider&#39;, and they succeeded in temporarily restoring the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magus had all gone out to the battlefield and was doing his best to buy time. The reason for this was to let Silvia, Elmesia, and other important people escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they returned to the battlefield, the warriors&#39; efforts would have been in vain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;To tell you the truth, I don&#39;t like the idea of us running away alone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I agree with Mom. Lim will make fun of me later, so I&#39;ll do my best. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had already made up their minds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your Majesty!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one of the elders shouts in desperation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the minister who had sent Laplace-Sarion into battle so long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has regretted it ever since. They have vowed never to do it again, and this time they are doing their best to protect their beloved Elmesia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Elmesia turns back to the face of the rulers and asks the question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who am I?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As an elder, I had to answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am the Emperor of Japan. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who could stand in my way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The minister wept inwardly, thinking that it was cowardly to wield power at a time like this. However, he understands that this is Elmesia&#39;s way of life, and there is nothing he can do to stop her now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It can&#39;t be. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could do nothing but bow my head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that the minister, now the eldest, had given his approval, there was nothing the others could do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The heads of the thirteen royal families must fulfill their duties as kings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the most subordinate of the Emperor, they were entrusted to lead the people in accordance with his order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your Majesty... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude-chan... Elen-chan will be protected by Limu... so you should protect them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Me too, I&#39;ll be your friend too!&quot;Me too, I&#39;ll be your friend too!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m in the way. It&#39;s true that Elalude-chan is one of the Magus leaders, but he&#39;ll just die for nothing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not Elmesia who objected, but Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude thought that they had never met before, but Silvia thought that he was her beloved husband&#39;s brother. Even when she pretended to be Elmesia, they had met many times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why she rejected him coldly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elise Grimwald, grandmother of Elmesia and mother of Elalude, nodded her head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In her capacity as the first of the thirteen royal families, she ordered Elalude, the archduke</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other kings listen to me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He declares in a dignified voice, though he is usually calm and gentle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do not be selfish, but do your will.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a pressure that was irresistible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other kings could not help but nod their heads, if not their hearts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But, mother...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elalude, who was still trying to argue, was silenced by Eris&#39;s stare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the first time Elalude had ever seen his mother really angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the kings admonishes Elalude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If Master Elis had not stopped you, you would have been bound. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An older royal, who had long ago given up the throne to his sons, tapped Elalude on the shoulder and spoke to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Give up. Silvia has been in hiding since your brother Sarion disappeared. No wonder she doesn&#39;t know how scary he is... but he&#39;s even more scary than the king!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, yes. We&#39;re no match for him. We&#39;d better take your word for it and run for it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an unspoken rule in Sarion never to say she was dead. It was a natural habit, as no one wanted to incur Silvia&#39;s wrath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And everyone laments their helplessness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once again, we are dependent on them for our survival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if this is the wish of the emperor, it is the duty of his subjects to obey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young kings, seeing their elders, have realized this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no use in rebellion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, they were surprised to learn that Sarion was really a monolith.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The parents&#39; and grandparents&#39; generations, who usually seemed to be at odds with each other, were talking to each other amicably. It was the first time for me to see such a situation, but it was so natural that I did not feel any falsehood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone agreed that it was because of the Charys of Silvia and Elmesia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia is a spear master who wields a vajra with her Ultimate Skill &#39;Thunder King (Indra)&#39;, the highest level in the weather system. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her daughter Elmesia El&#39;Ru Sarion also has a different face from that of the emperor of the Sorcerer&#39;s Dynasty of Sarion. She has awakened to the Ultimate Skill &#39;Vayu&#39;, the highest level of the weather system, which seems to have been split off from Silvia, and is a genius in battle, cutting her enemies to pieces by freely manipulating a mythical-grade chakram. Elmesia was a genius in battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia&#39;s ability, though inferior to Silvia&#39;s, was not far behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once again, they returned to the battlefield with the wishes of all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is how they found their way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heaven helps those who help themselves. Through their courageous actions, hope is unbroken and leads to the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru, Souei, Leon, Kagali, Teare, and the others arrived in Sarion some time after Silvia and the others returned to the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were seen in the images in the &quot;Control Room&quot; after their second sortie. Therefore, they were already exhausted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wounded seemed to be receiving medical treatment on the leaves of a giant sacred tree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia and Elmesia were protecting them, while Jahil and Zalario were dealing with them. The defense mechanism of the tree was working, which was the only reason why everyone was not killed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia was impressed, &quot;You really sent us reinforcements when we thought it would be too late, Rimuchi...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia greeted Benimaru and the others with emotion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama will keep his promise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru smiled and nodded, looking at Zalario and Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon flew in front of Zalario to replace Elmesia. The Flame Pillar in his hand gleams and has a strong presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei had been sneaking up behind Zalario before he knew it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone is floating around the sacred tree to fight in the air, and Souei is also floating in the sky as a matter of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it was two against one, Leon and Souei were at a disadvantage in terms of the difference of strength. However, Souei did not care about fairness and justice, and he was ready to make a surprise attack without any hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil, on the other hand, said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I won&#39;t forgive you!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kagali floats next to Silvia. At this level, they can create a foothold in the air as well as on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, they won&#39;t let me take my place, Silvia thinks, but I can still fight if I try hard enough, so I&#39;m thankful they&#39;re cooperating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re so cocky...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare glares at Jahil, who grits his teeth, as if challenging him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three of them surrounded each other in a three-on-one formation, and a battle was about to break out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru grasps the situation of the war from a bird&#39;s eye view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except for Jahil and Zalario, who are generals, Magus is the best in the battle. Magus has quickly recovered and started to push back phantom&#39;s forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Now, if we could defeat both Jahil and Zalario, we would be victorious.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Knowing that it would not be easy, Benimaru reads the war situation with a wry smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon, facing Zalario, is in a bad mood, despite his usual expressionless face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon is easily misunderstood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is not a good talker, and even his well-meaning actions are often the cause of resentment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The few people who understand Leon are Silvia, his mentor, and Elmesia, whom he considers to be his ally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To torment both of them to this extent was the second most offensive act to Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, it is needless to say that the first place is awarded to Chloe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, there are other reasons for my anger this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t forgive myself for being dominated by them, and I can&#39;t forgive myself for causing trouble to Silvia because of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanted to take Michael, the cause of the trouble, into my own hands. But it seems that Rimuru beat him to the punch, and he feels bad that he owes Silvia a debt that he cannot repay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he did not repay the favor here, he would be in a worse position than ever before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia alone was enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, Leon was sure that this time it was not only a problem of Silvia and her friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The purpose of Velzard is unknown, but it seems that he is on his way to us while fighting with Milim. If they are caught in the aftermath of the battle with Milim, this place could easily disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon does not think this is the end of the story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Sarion, there is no obstacle to the Western Nations where mankind is thriving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the west was the Deadly Desert, and beyond that was Damargania, the &quot;Holy Void.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if we turn slightly southwest, we reach El Dorado, Leon&#39;s dominion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Velzard&#39;s intentions were unknown, there was no doubt that one of these places was targeted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is only Velzard, we can take countermeasures against him, whatever his intentions may be. However, with Milim running amok, it would be extremely difficult to interfere in any way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is it Velzard&#39;s will or Feldway&#39;s strategy? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Whatever it is, we will stop it.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was Leon&#39;s decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s principle is to make a quick decision and to punish the suspected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, it is up to Rimuru and his team to stop Velzard and Milim, but there is no doubt that Sarion is one of the most important defense lines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As a proof of this, it was exposed to the enemy attack, and it was necessary to eliminate the enemy general before Milim could reach there. Then, we can deal with Milim&#39;s outburst with all our strength.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.3fwokq0"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, it would be suicide to fight them directly, but we can at least try to reduce the damage by making them change direction. We can&#39;t let them go towards El Dorado, and we can&#39;t threaten the human sphere of existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It would be best to lead them to the barren lands.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon thought it would be the best way, though he was sorry for Dagruel. For that reason, he could not be disturbed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Feldway has a very clever plan to take advantage of Milim&#39;s outburst,&quot; he said to Zalario. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While speaking to Zalario, Leon thrust the tip of his sword at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s fighting style is similar to that of Fenn Xing. He was good at brilliant techniques, mainly thrusting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some people think that Fenn Xin Gu is a dueling swordsmanship and not suitable for actual combat, but this is not true. The most powerful of all sword techniques is the thrust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s swordsmanship overcame this weakness. Like Silvia&#39;s spear technique, Leon could avoid being pursued by the attackers by combining it with the divine speed of his body technique.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s power is specialized in speed, and his weapon, Flame Pillar, is of mythical-grade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a serious fight, Leon does not rely on the Golden Circle. Combined with the fastest speed without regard to defense and the most powerful swordsmanship concentrated on a single point, Leon was also called the hero of the flash.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, Leon could manipulate the spiritron at will with his Ultimate Skill &#39;Purity King (Metatron)&#39;. This enables him to perform the most powerful &quot;Disintegration&quot; repeatedly, and no one has the means to stop him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was the reason why Leon was called the strongest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In terms of existence value, Leon is not far behind Zalario. However, in terms of combat ability... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, if we consider his fighting ability, Leon&#39;s lean fighting style was enough to compete with Zalario&#39;s. A warrior knows a warrior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A warrior knows a warrior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario also recognized Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why he said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They said they wanted Veldora&#39;s factor, but I don&#39;t know what they are really thinking. Velzard is acting on his own, and I&#39;d like to know what he&#39;s really thinking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is very frank and honest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Zalario has not been given any explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is waging a war to overthrow Sarion as ordered by Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil also wanted Luminas, but he was included in our operation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Since they are willing to go that far, it must make sense for them to take this place...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no more uninspiring work than being forced to work without understanding the logic behind it. Zalario thought it was an unpleasant way to treat a general, even if he was a soldier at the end who was expected to serve as a cog in the wheel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not able to resist Michael&#39;s control, which is why he was willing to accept such treatment. However, Zalario, who had always been looking for an opportunity, had a chance to release it the moment Michael disappeared. Since then, he had been analyzing the system little by little, and it was almost ready to be released.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since he was not obliged to explain it all, Zalario changed the subject.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, Leon, are you going to play with me? Or do you want me to play with both of you at the same time, even you who are sneaking around in the back?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario glances at Benimaru, who is not going to make a move. He was not licking their lips, but was going to distribute his forces appropriately on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That decision is tantamount to underestimating them, but it does not matter to the unwilling Zalario. He cannot disobey orders, so he will just let it slide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei knew that his presence would be noticed. Unlike Jahil, Zalario seemed to be on his guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s conclusion was that Zalario was more troublesome than Jahil, although Jahil was more threatening in terms of existence value alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei agreed with Benimaru&#39;s conclusion. Therefore, he did not intend to take Zalario by surprise, but was prepared to support Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If they know, it&#39;s too soon to talk. We can&#39;t afford to do so, and we have to justify every action to win. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei declared his intention to &#39;cheat&#39; without any hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon had no objection to this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was natural for him to aim at the victory with all possible means, since it would be meaningless if he lost the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the battle for Zalario started with Leon as the main player and Souei assisting him.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Against Jahil, the three players attacked in different ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia attacked with lightning fire and spear blows with va-jura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kagali used long-range mana bullets. Controlling the force with Ruin Scepter, they polished mana masses and hit them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare stood at the very front and acted as a checker.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although this is the most dangerous role, Teare is not afraid. He was not afraid, because he had anger in his body and was furious on behalf of Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hate you! You&#39;re dead!&quot;Shut up! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Shut up! Shut up, you herd-dwelling trash!&quot;You&#39;re the one who&#39;s annoying!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re the one who&#39;s annoying! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare retorts, throwing the scythe in his hand like a boomerang. It was a weapon given to him by an ogre called Kurobee before his departure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a scythe that had been given to me by a demon called Kurobee before our departure. It had a hekai-like atmosphere. Teare intuits that it is much better than his own broken scythe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The name of the scythe is said to be &quot;Teare Scythe of Falling Tears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kurobee told me that it is a scythe that reaps tears, not lives.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare thought it was the perfect weapon for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would have to end his sadness this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare Scythe&quot; aims at Jahil as if it has a mind of its own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, it rapidly improves its physical ability and approaches Jahil at once. He dives into Jahil&#39;s bosom and delivers a powerful punch. He quickly breaks away and catches the scythe as it spins back around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He then maintains his position to protect Kagali as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a feat made possible only by the fact that he controlled his own body with his Unique Skill &#39;Ayatsurumono&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare&#39;s Unique Skill &#39;Optimist&#39; was only activated under the vague and specific condition of &quot;when he receives an order&quot;. This is because Teare&#39;s ego is weak and fluffy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, given a piece of Clayman - the &quot;information particle&quot; that constituted his &quot;Kokoro&quot; - Teare changed. Teare was changed by being given the piece of Clayman - the &quot;information particle&quot; that made up his &quot;core.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He became stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He decided that he must protect Kagali in place of Laplace, who had disappeared, and Footman, who had been taken over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, someone asks Teare</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">If you agree, you will be given power</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the voice of someone who was not present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sleeping Teare had been analyzed, and the plan was planted in her mind that she would need it sooner or later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was designed to respond to Teare&#39;s willful need for power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, there is a price to pay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was paid in advance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare&#39;s power had long been analyzed and determined to be harmless. Likewise, it had been determined that it would not do any harm if integrated with Clayman&#39;s non-threatening power, and it had been planted in the spirit of service to strengthen it a little while it was on our side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I&#39;ll take anything if you give it to me! I have to be strong ! )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Teare accepts without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The change was completed in Teare quietly and quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare&#39;s Unique Skill &#39;Optimist&#39; and the Unique Skill &#39;Performer&#39; reproduced from Clayman&#39;s &quot;information particle&quot; given to him, and the Ultimate Enchantment &#39;Orpheus&#39; was born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was all the work of someone (Ciel).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Teare was reborn of his own will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Yes! I know, Clayman. Atai, we have to protect Kagali-sama ! Teare swears.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare swears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Teare&#39;s power comes out. It is as if her late friend (Clayman) is lending her strength. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The existence value of over 2,400,000, which I had been feeling like I had too much, now seems to be not enough. If I doubled the power I needed at each moment, I wouldn&#39;t be intimidated by a superior Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Jahil who was not amused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t you dare to mock me, you puppet!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil, looking annoyed, fires a huge fireball.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia, who is so fast, has no way to escape from Kagali and Teare. The soul should have been obliterated by the blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Kagali and Teare disappeared as if they were flickering, and they appeared at a little distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This startled Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? You didn&#39;t have such power...what have you done ? What have you done? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil carefully released the fireball, trying to be sure this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The trick, which Zalario would have easily figured out, was as simple as a child&#39;s trick. Benimaru was protecting the Kagali with his &#39;yang-en&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil, who had been put through the wringer so many times with Benimaru, realized it the second time around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What nonsense!&quot; he said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was easily enraged, and in a fit of emotion, he fired a volley of fireballs at the Kagali group. But this only played into Benimaru&#39;s hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Benimaru had not dealt with Jahil directly, he was able to read his thinking and behavior patterns and give him the best advice for the Kagali people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, he was able to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, there&#39;s a chance!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia&#39;s spear pierces Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia felt a little relieved, though it did not kill Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Kagali, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Ultimate Enchantment &#39;Domination King (Melchizedek)&#39;, the power given by Michael, was still taken away by Yuuki. Instead, Kagali, who was now free, enhanced his Unique Skill &#39;Schemer&#39;, which was rooted in his soul, and raised it to a near-ultimate power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, no matter how excellent Kagali was, there was a limit to the level of ungodliness. It would be abnormal for Kagali to be able to play with the power at will, as Ciel did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kagali had experienced this abnormality in his dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her voice was clear.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If you </span><span class="c3">wish, I can give you power.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the unintelligible offer spoken to me in my sleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, it was Ciel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel can do almost anything in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not a dream but a conversation in Kagali&#39;s subconscious. Ciel then proposed a contract.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In exchange for optimizing Kagali&#39;s power, he would not allow her to turn it against Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if Kagali was betrayed, the power would still be in Ciel&#39;s hands... it was a two birds with one stone proposal that combined both hobby and profit. Depending on one&#39;s point of view, it might even seem that only Ciel would benefit from the proposal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kagali, who had been craving for power, agreed to the proposal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought it was a dream and did not suspect that he was being cheated. This is a blunder of a very cautious Kagali, but as long as he does not antagonize Rimuru, he will not suffer any disadvantage. For Kagali, there was no problem since he did not want to antagonize Rimuru for various reasons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when he woke up, Kagali realized the existence of that power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He understood it and now fully owns it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Give me back my Footman!&quot;Give me back my Footman! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kagali cries out and activates her Ultimate Enchantment, &#39;Agath Teare&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if it could see the future, the power predicted Jahil&#39;s move. As if it could see into the future, it predicted Jahil&#39;s move. As if it could fill the gap in power, the joint attack was successful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, Benimaru&#39;s judgment, Kagali&#39;s prediction, Silvia&#39;s action, and Teare&#39;s determination were combined. Even Jahil&#39;s evil power could not be overturned so easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, Benimaru had fought against Jahil before. When he first saw Jahil, he was flustered by the difference in power, but he already knew the nature of Jahil&#39;s power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you know it, you have nothing to fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru has inherited Rimuru&#39;s policy of not fighting a battle that cannot be won. Therefore, the fact that Benimaru came here meant that he had a chance to win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the pieces of the puzzle were in place, and the moment of victory was just around the corner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unaware of this, Jahil barks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are so cocky! You seem to have forgotten how terrifying I am! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil shouts as he aims a volley of fireballs at Kagali and hides in the aftermath of the explosion. Then, using the explosion as a propulsion, he approaches Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He intends to kill Kagali first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aiming at the weakest first is an ironclad rule, and Jahil&#39;s judgment is not wrong. However, it was too easy to read his thoughts and too easy to wait for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone thinks, &quot;No way!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia says, &quot;You&#39;re kidding, I&#39;ve never seen such an easy fight before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knew that Rimuru was not the only threat. Kagali thinks that it would be a great help if they were our allies, but I shudder to think what would happen if they were our enemies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teare, who was in charge of the most dangerous role, felt that he was very secure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s how excellent Benimaru&#39;s conducting is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is a man who has a sense of responsibility as a leader, although he sometimes talks weakly in front of Rimuru. Like Diablo, he is more dependable and works harder without Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For this reason, Benimaru is now a nervous man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is connected to those under his command through &#39;Telepathy Net&#39;, and Benimaru&#39;s authority - &#39;Heat King (Amaterasu) The result was that all the members were able to play an active role as if they were all of one will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The result is the reality that they are able to compete with Jahil, who is far superior to them, more than equally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Benimaru were alone, it would have been impossible for him to win against Jahil. Because of the same lineage, he lacks decisiveness, and no matter how much he tries, he cannot beat Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As before, we had to fight to avoid losing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now it is different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have Silvia, the decisive force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have the safety of Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have Teare to follow up perfectly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s feeling is that he does not feel like losing.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario looked at Jahil with a sideways glance and was a little surprised. He was being overwhelmed by the inferior opponent, even though he should have been superior to him in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Jahil is not a fool. (Jahil is not a fool. He is arrogant, but he is not a fool to let his guard down. So, the man is superior.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understood this by glancing at Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not directly involved in the battle, but he was always there to provide appropriate support at the right time and place. Since Benimaru&#39;s power is of the same lineage as Jahil&#39;s, he seemed to neutralize the flame attack nicely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Flame is very powerful when it is focused, but its thermal efficiency decreases rapidly when it is deflected. The same is true in the case of Jahil, who interferes with the magicule with his dominance enhanced by his authority, and then launches a superheated flame attack. However, it was natural that the focal temperature would decrease if the heat wave was directed to another direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It should not be an easy task, but Benimaru seems to be doing it with a nonchalant face. Zalario was frankly impressed and praised Benimaru&#39;s work, even though he was an enemy of Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Jahil is far superior to Benimaru in terms of the amount of energy, and Benimaru would not be able to withstand a direct hit. No matter how much the interference power to the magicule is superior, there is nothing we can do if we are bombarded with uncontrollable energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Hmm, it seems that Jahil is trying to avoid such a situation, but I wonder if he will get tired of it soon.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario thought so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil is a man who is known as a great magician. If he knew his current situation, he would understand that he would be in dire straits if he did not do something about Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;But it&#39;s a good one.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No wonder Zalario thinks so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s inducement is very skillful, and his explosions and impacts are tremendous. At first glance, he seems to be overwhelming, which is the reason why Jahil is late to realize the current situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the coordination among the members is also lean. Each of them was doing his/her role with great care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of them seemed to be directed by Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru himself was a warrior in his own right, but he showed greater talent as a generals. Secretly, Zalario recognized Benimaru as a threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You are a fool to look away from me when you are fighting against me!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon said calmly after the crossfire of the swordfight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not seem to be particularly angry, but simply said what he thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario smiled and replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it is not like that. Since both of us are at the same level of skill, the one who is in a hurry will be the one to lose. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario says so, but he is able to pass Leon&#39;s sword with ease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, his words are not false. It is hard to tell the difference when you are a high level fencer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The trajectory of a sword can be predicted from information such as the opponent&#39;s line of sight, the position of his body, and the direction of his signs. If you are on such a level playing field, the victory or defeat depends on how well you succeed in your feints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario thought that it would be better than trying to force a move and getting injured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy was not only Leon, but also Souei, who was a troublesome ambush. He could not let his guard down, even if he was a lower ranked player, because he attacked Zalario as if he knew when Zalario did not want to attack him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Existence value - a numerical value calculated by taking into account the elements of the body, the amount of energy, various resistances, and so on, but it is only a rough estimate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, just as Jahil, who specializes in power, cannot outrun his opponent who specializes in speed, the game may turn out to be a toss-up if the two are not well matched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario was well aware of such a truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He does not know the existence value, but he knows the strength of his opponent. However, he deeply understood from his long years of experience as a warrior that if he judged everything only on this basis, he would be caught flatfooted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, licking the opponent is out of the question. He never let his guard down even though he was playing against Leon and Souei at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon also recognized the nature of Zalario in such a short period of time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Zalario is a very difficult opponent. (It is really difficult to play if there is no room for error.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Leon thinks about his own situation on the shelf. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the enemy was careless, he could use his special attack, but it was unlikely that Zalario would be able to do so. No matter how good Leon is at one-hit-and-destroy strategy, he would leave himself open for a special attack. If he tried to avoid such a situation, he would not be able to avoid a long battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a case, the one who is inferior in all respects is at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Leon, who was competing only on the basis of skill (level), he could see the future that he would be defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Zalario&#39;s policy was correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since they have read each other so far, their responses are in sharp contrast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario is calm and collected, and Leon is losing his composure little by little. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Leon was not alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Calm down. Don&#39;t be fooled by the enemy&#39;s words.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei, who had come out of the shadows, whispered in Leon&#39;s ear. Then, he launched a seemingly reckless suicide attack on Zalario, who was cut down with a single sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Needless to say, this is Souei&#39;s &#39;Clone&#39;. However, the attack was surprisingly effective, since it was a wave attack mixed with fiction and fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon is the main cutter, but Souei takes over when he gets tired. By repeating this, they were able to continue the battle with as little wear and tear as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s situation was not so good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the midst of such a stalemate, a sudden change occurred.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru made a move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elmesia (Your Majesty), I have a favor to ask you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was talking to Elmesia, who had been leaving the room to recover from fatigue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario listens to Benimaru&#39;s words without listening to him, thinking that he is relaxed even though he is in the middle of a battle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your knights, are they Magus? I&#39;d like you to give me the command, if only temporarily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario was taken in by the conversation at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon was also miffed at this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He felt as if he had been ignored, but Leon was interested in Benimaru&#39;s story as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? That&#39;s a little too much to ask...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know it&#39;s impossible. However, it was reported that Milim-sama would be there soon. The damage to this area will be immeasurable if we don&#39;t do something to stop it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is that from Rimu?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia looks at him as if she has no choice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Normally, it&#39;s absolutely impossible, no matter how friendly they are, but if Rimu says so, I don&#39;t have a choice.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia is calling the group leaders together while blurting out &quot;If the boss is the boss, then the subordinates are the subordinates, aren&#39;t they?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this, Zalario thought, &#39;No, it&#39;s really impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This is absurd. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, it&#39;s Rimuru.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is that so?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t understand it, to tell you the truth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, Zalario empathizes with Leon, who is supposed to be his enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But still, Zalario thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is this Benimaru guy going to do with Jahil?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he watched with interest, he heard the group leaders complaining about it. It was a very natural reaction, but Elmesia silenced them by blackmailing them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They seemed to be saying that it was the time of crisis, and Benimaru was doing something to prove it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An image was projected in the space.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Benimaru has used his power to project a long-distance image into the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It seems to be an application of mirage. It seems that Benimaru has improved upon the surveillance magic &quot;Argus&quot; developed by Rimuru-sama. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason, Souei explained it to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, the battle is still going on. The sword fights are still going on, but the work is getting stronger, and we have time to talk with each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s swordsmanship is a hard sword that cuts down his enemies with a single stroke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s nemesis, the insectar, is covered with an exoskeleton, so the sword is damaged by repeated slashes. In order to prevent this from happening, Zalario has refined his technique to cut accurately at the weakest point of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since the time in the other world and the Cardinal World are different, Zalario has been fighting for more than tens of billions of years in his experience. The reason why Zalario&#39;s skill with the sword is so low is that he has specialized in the characteristics of insectar enemies. Nevertheless, some of them were unusually good fighters, and Zalario&#39;s strength had reached an unimaginable level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s unwillingness to fight was the only reason why the battle with Leon and his group was successful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon and Souei also realized Zalario&#39;s true strength the moment they confronted him. Nevertheless, both of them are quite determined to chat with each other and explain the situation without panicking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The video clip that appeared on the screen showed Rimuru and his team in action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru is playing with Milim and Guy is playing with Velzard. Velgrynd was also there for some reason, and they were cooperating with each other to prevent any damage to the surrounding area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I didn&#39;t know Velgrynd was cooperating. Rimuru, your talent for philanthropy is amazing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I would like you to call it a human virtue.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon and Souei were arguing with each other, but Zalario had no time to worry about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did not understand why Milim and the others were heading this way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the first place, it was not clear whether this was the plan or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is Feldway planning something, or is it just a coincidence? There is a possibility that Velzard did this on his own, but in that case, I could not imagine what he was trying to achieve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, if this was Feldway&#39;s scheme.... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(If Feldway had told Velzard something, this situation is also possible. In that case, what is the purpose?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim and Velzard had been fighting, but this was done in such a way that Velzard was able to stop Milim from going out of control. If Velzard sets his sights on other targets, his hands will be free.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim would then go to the limit of his destructive power, and Guy would most likely move to stop him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was exactly what Velzard wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy would not be able to afford to fight against Milim. He would take advantage of the situation and make Guy do his bidding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is easy to read that far, so I don&#39;t think Guy will come out of the fight. It is only natural that he would bring along a collaborator, and it makes sense that it was the Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That much is fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem was what came after that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It was obvious that Velzard wanted Guy. But then, there was no point in moving to a different location. ) I guessed Zalario, but I was not sure if he had any intention to move to the new location.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario, who has made such an inference, is now troubled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why would they come all the way to Sarion, which they are attacking?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To support Zalario&#39;s team?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;No, I don&#39;t think so. What is Feldway thinking?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario could not find an answer to his question and grew frustrated with Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He should have explained it from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we do not understand what they intend to do by leading Milim to this place, we may be involved in the situation. If we did not know whether we should cooperate or evacuate, we would be stuck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the defending forces were only Silvia and Elmesia, Zalario and his men could easily defeat Sarion. However, the situation is now in a stalemate because Demon Lord Rimuru has sent reinforcements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a weak reason to say that they sent Milim because they expected such a situation. In that case, the Zalarios should have started their invasion after first hitting Milim to confuse the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that Milim would reach them only after the chaos was over should have made sense in that situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, yes, it would make sense to let Milim get in the way of the invasion because no one could move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thinking of this, Zalario turned his head to look behind him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Standing there is the tree of God that has been standing on this land since time immemorial.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tree, rooted in the earth and responsible for protecting the planet from all kinds of natural disasters, was still standing strong, even though it was exposed to the flames of Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the tree that once protected the land from the damage caused by the war between Milim and Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the north, there was Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The human sphere ruled by Demon Lord Luminas was protected by Guy and Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Nasca region, guarded by Rudra, was also safe, thanks to the cooperation of Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the sanctuary Damargania, the center of the damage, was not destroyed because of &quot;Heaven&#39;s Tower&quot;, but still bears the scars of the devastation. Its former glory is still lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, on the other hand...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if we look at it the other way around... we can say that only so much damage has been done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world is protected by God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we want to destroy the world, we have to face many obstacles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy the mediator is the best of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, the mediator, is the best of them. He is feared by mankind as the strongest and the worst demon lord, but he has been protecting this world by keeping his pact with Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, there are several beings who are responsible for protecting the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the demon lords selected by Guy, including Ramiris, another mediator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the heroic ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In particular, there was Masayuki, the reincarnation of the most powerful Rudra, who was now leading Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from them, the relics influenced by the hand of God, such as &quot;Heaven&#39;s Tower&quot;, would also be in the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One such relic was the tree of the gods.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Feldway&#39;s plan to revive Veldanava-sama failed because of the loss of Michael. Then, what is his next target?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario felt a chill running down his spine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are only two relics left in this world: the sacred tree and Heaven&#39;s Tower. There is also the labyrinth created by Ramiris, but it should have been considered as a separate category.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are only a few notable ones left to disturb us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy, Rimuru, Chronoa, Masayuki, Velgrynd, and Veldora, most of whom had been neutralized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velzard blocked Guy&#39;s move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru had his hands full trying to deal with Milim&#39;s outburst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chronoa and Masayuki are free, but they are probably exhausted and will not be able to move for a while.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd seems to be working to protect the planet. He is no longer a threat, since he seems to be using most of his strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Veldora is now in the labyrinth of Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Veldora has been on the defensive because of Feldway&#39;s attempts to kill her, which in turn means that she is now stuck in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, if Feldway&#39;s target was as Zalario expected, the situation was steadily improving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is not good, Zalario thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be honest, Zalario had no desire for destruction. If he was going to die, he really wanted to die alone, and he had no intention to be involved in the destruction of the world, no matter how good a friend he was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the first place, Zalario thought that he should stop this foolishness because he was his friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I don&#39;t know if I am right or not, but we should assume so and act accordingly.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m right or not, but we should act as if I am.) If I&#39;m wrong, we should just say that it&#39;s the guy&#39;s fault for not explaining. Zalario concluded in this way and tried to change his mind about what he should do from now on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he looked around and noticed that Benimaru was leading Magus in an imposing manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario was impressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;He was impressed by Benimaru&#39;s ability to play a trick on Jahil, and yet be prepared for the coming natural disasters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this aspect, Jahil looks like a small man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for Zalario, who did not like Jahil, it was enough to make him like Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was settled - Zalario decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario talked to Leon and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As you know, I am deprived of my freedom. I&#39;ve taken back enough control to be able to say what I think, but Michael still controls me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If you&#39;ve been through what I&#39;ve been through, you&#39;d understand what I&#39;m trying to say, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm. You want me to help you get him out? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m glad you&#39;re so quick on the uptake. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a casual tone, Zalario made a proposal...</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.1v1yuxt"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru took control of Magus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even when Elmesia gave permission, the knights complained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru could understand their dissatisfaction that why should they be used by someone from another country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, now is not the time to talk about such things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was because he understood this that Elmesia lent him the command, and Elalude duke reluctantly showed his willingness to obey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The knights who are members of the group are apparently super elites with titles, but they must be obeyed. If we try to respond to them, we will be exposed to Milim&#39;s fury and be destroyed in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(As I said, Milim-sama is a great force. The topography of the Kusha Mountains has already been changed, and this place will be destroyed in the same way. I must do my best to prevent that from happening.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was determined not to let that happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru&#39;s order was a simple one: to predict the course of the ship and to change it somehow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that if the projectile continues on its present course, it will hit the &quot;sacred tree&quot; that protects the royal city of Sarion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru did not sound confident, but Benimaru knew. Benimaru knew that Rimuru&#39;s predictions are never wrong in such a situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the worst case scenario, he had told them to evacuate everyone, but they should try their best first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The key was Magus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru said that if we attacked Milim with the combined power of all of us, we might be able to distract him, even if only for a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said that the possibility of defeating Milim was not yet discussed, so there was no need to worry about injuring Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(No one is worried about that...), Benimaru said bitterly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru smiles wryly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, tightening his grip, Elalude shouted to the knights who were trying to persuade him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen! If this situation continues, an unprecedented crisis will come to this land. I have orders from my lord Rimuru-sama to stop it! You may not have the right to do so, but you must obey now. Or your homeland will be destroyed!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru did not intend to threaten us, but only to tell us the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they fail to follow Rimuru&#39;s instructions here, Sarion will almost certainly be destroyed. Of course, Benimaru himself is not going to give up even if Magus does not follow the order. He was going to do his utmost to save lives by helping with the evacuation, and then he was going to join Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil and the others were mere obstacles to Benimaru. Kagali, Teare, and Silvia alone would be enough to defeat them. With Benimaru&#39;s support, however, the level of difficulty is such that it can be done with a single hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, Benimaru would like to be prepared for the coming threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, we were waiting for the reply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru used his own authority to project an image in the mid-air in order to convey the situation quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Souei explained to Zalario, Benimaru reproduced the image at a long distance by using his own power, the &#39;Heat King (Amaterasu)&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This technique, which was developed by Benimaru with reference to mirages, was very useful in outdoor operations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the situation of Milim&#39;s group was projected on the screen, it would be more convincing. Benimaru thought so, but it turned out to be a more terrifying scene than he had expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mere sound of Milim&#39;s roar was enough to destroy the mountains and rivers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rivers dried up and mountains crumbled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru tries desperately to calm them down, but to no avail. Working with Velgrynd to avoid causing unnecessary damage, they seem unable to do anything other than to take as much of Milim&#39;s attack as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;No, no. (- No, it&#39;s because Rimuru-sama is distracting Milim-sama, that they are able to do only that much damage...).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru was taking all of Milim&#39;s attention, and Velgrynd was preventing the aftermath. It was natural for Rimuru to become desperate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would have been possible for Rimuru to guide Milim, but that would have been impossible. Milim&#39;s attack is like a torrent, which can be withstood and deflected, but it is impossible to change its direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Or is there some other reason for this, just to keep us from worrying?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In any case, Benimaru had only to do his duty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(If we can distract them for a moment, we might be able to change the course of our lives. I&#39;ll do it.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru took a deep breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he failed, it would be a disaster. Worst case scenario, the world might end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a bad bet, but he decided to trust Rimuru as he always did, knowing that it was the only way to win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was fine with it, but Magus was not so lucky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was impossible for him not to be upset when he was shown that scene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a situation, Benimaru, who was standing tall, was the center of attention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia opens her mouth just as Magus becomes quiet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Once again, I leave the command of Magus to Benimaru-dono. Does anyone have any objection?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia asks this question with an air of intimidation, but no one replies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Well, of course. (Well, no one was stupid enough to complain after being shown that...)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Elmesia had really given the order, all of them would have obeyed Benimaru at the risk of their lives. But then, some of them might have worked without understanding what they were being asked to do, and some of them might have worked without getting rid of their dissatisfaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru did not seem to have thought that far, but the result was the best settlement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With no time to lose, Benimaru gave orders one after another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though he was dealing with knights of other countries, he did not hesitate to be bold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many people seemed to feel that Benimaru&#39;s boldness was dependable, and Benimaru&#39;s reputation was rising rapidly, unintentionally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, the preparations were progressing steadily.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we approached Sarion, we saw a huge tree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was clearly visible, although it was still some distance away. It was enough to make me understand how big this &quot;divine tree&quot; was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how big it is, it would be no match for Milim&#39;s fury. The power of Milim is so overwhelming that I am convinced of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have already seen this so much on the way to this place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The only reason why this planet is still safe is because of Velgrynd-san&#39;s offer to help us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He came all the way to our planet because he was worried that our planet would be in chaos if the world collapsed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t really need to thank Velgrynd-san that much, since she would be in trouble if the world collapses, but even if that happens, she can escape with Dimension Leap, can&#39;t she? As for me, I accepted the offer of cooperation gratefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard that &#39;Split Body&#39; has been left next to Masayuki, and the power of &#39;Split Body&#39; here is only about 70%. Even so, he was helping me a lot, and I could rely on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I was apt to be spoiled by them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to ask you something, but can&#39;t you protect the tree from being damaged?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I asked Velgrynd-san, as if it were a dead end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The result was as I expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re still a fool, aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m doing my best to maintain the &#39;Star Barrier&#39; even though Milim doesn&#39;t seem to take it seriously. And yet, Milim can manipulate star particles. There isn&#39;t a &#39;Barrier&#39; in the world that can take Drago Nova head-on. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Velgrynd-san gave me a cold stare.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill012.jpg" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wish I hadn&#39;t said anything unnecessary, but I was still nervous about the destructive power of a beautiful woman&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But you know, I heard that Drago Nova was also reflected...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s because Milim was holding back.

Well, it&#39;s natural that he can&#39;t use his full power since he might destroy the stars while he&#39;s trying to eliminate the enemy army.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim, however, is now in a state of outburst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a mistake to expect them to take it easy on us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, we have to somehow break the order to Milim before the real Milim unleashes Drago Nova.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what was to be done?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san&#39;s plan was to gather all possible forces and attack Milim in waves to turn his attention to us. In the meantime, I would neutralize Feldway&#39;s power and cancel his orders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Milim is controlled by Feldway&#39;s power, but it is not perfect. Ciel-san confidently assured me that I could break the control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be precise, Ciel-san, not me, would be the one to break it... but to do so, he said, Milim&#39;s consciousness must be distracted. So, I can&#39;t accomplish this by myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought that Velgrynd-san could take care of Milim and I could release the order while Velgrynd-san was dealing with Milim, but I was told that the aftermath might cause a catastrophe on the ground in that case. Velgrynd-san came here without asking me to, so I understood that it would be so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it were possible, I would like to be a turgett and take action to minimize the damage. However, it is impossible to do so, and it is a very reckless strategy that is difficult to estimate how much damage will be caused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moreover, the success rate is not high.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">Good news.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We have </span><span class="c3">found an element that may increase the probability of success</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oops?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hate bad news, but I love good news.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We have </span><span class="c3">confirmed the presence of Demon Lord Leon and Zalario in the vicinity of the destination.

He wanted to find out how Feldway&#39;s &quot;Ultimate Dominion&quot; was working while he was exercising his full power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon was also under the control of Feldway, but now he seems to have been released. I am not sure what will happen if I use the power again, but that is why I thought that I could get a chance to escape from this situation by examining it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon also responded to the question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Enviably, in Leon&#39;s case, it seems that Demon Lord Rimuru has sealed the &quot;domination circuit&quot; that is built into the Angelic Skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, it did not help us to verify Zalario, but it is worth trying the strategy of applying the load. So, I decided to go ahead with the plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s when I heard a strange voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard a strange voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I </span><span class="c3">have heard</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;your story.

(No wonder. Then, it would be a good idea to leave it to him.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon made a decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the first place, he can easily play with the &quot;control circuits&quot; built into other people&#39;s rights, so anything is possible, I suppose. It is as if he is advertising his power as a &quot;codswallop&quot; without even trying to hide it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only Leon but also other demon lords are unanimous in their opinion that &#39;Rimuru is a liar&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru&#39;s opinion is quite misleading, but he has no reason to complain since he is just as guilty as Ciel in letting Ciel do as he pleases.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario, on the other hand, was in a state of confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the surface, he was calm and maintained his appearance as a warrior. However, Zalario&#39;s inner world was not calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;How did you do that? How can you speak directly to my heart ? )</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario had never experienced such a direct talk to his heart before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon did not, but the earnest Zalario was caught from that point on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it had been Leon, he would have assumed that Zalario had directly hit him with a thought. However, Rimuru was not present. This is an impossible phenomenon according to Zalario&#39;s experience and common sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that is not all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario has, of course, put up a psychological barrier to prevent any kind of mental attack. Since Zalario is a mental organism to begin with, the defense of its core (Kokoro) is ironclad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It would have been unthinkable for others to modify the Ultimate Skill, which is closely related to the desire of the person himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(I don&#39;t understand.

But now, Zalario was released in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Ultimate Skill &#39;Judgement King (Israfil)&#39; which he had acquired was better to be thrown away than to stay under his control.

Although it compensates for the lack of some aspects, the direction of its authority is similar to that of the &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, it is a power specialized in spatial management.

If Zalario was serious, he could even reflect &quot;Leon&#39;s Disintegration&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Leon did not make any special move of his own in this fight. This is because he hesitated to use it because he had doubts about his power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, although there was no show, it was a fortunate event for both fighters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s power has been reborn by Ciel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39;, which allows him to manipulate all materials and wavelengths in the target space at will.

It was so difficult that Zalario, who has been alive for more than tens of billions of years, had finally acquired it by himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knew of its existence, but I thought I did not need it. Maybe that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t get it, but still....</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;It is a fact that it is not easy to acquire it. Is it possible ? I mean, who could do such a thing?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario is horrified at the thought of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill is a system created by the Creator Veldanava to manage the world. It can be used as a substitute for the authority of an administrator, but with a more specialized and convenient power, it can be used as if it were a god.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Depending on the conditions, even raising the dead is not impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Is it possible to create such a power that can easily destroy even the providence of the world?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario shuddered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a strange story to begin with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who in the world would do such a thing? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon answered to Zalario, who muttered to himself &quot;Who in the world would do such a thing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It was Rimuru. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rimuru?

I understood it by feeling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon answered in response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Leon had the &#39;Surya&#39; as his own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He accepted it as if it had been his power from the beginning without any sense of discomfort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon now can interfere with the spiritron without any difficulty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, Leon was better than Zalario in terms of simple skills (level).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario was also an experienced fighter, but his enemy was a uniform insectar, and he did not have the concept of training his skills. The same can be said of Obera, who fought the same opponents all the time, so that his techniques were optimized for his enemies. After his sword became mythical-grade, he was able to easily cut even the exoskeleton of his enemies, and he could not improve his skills (level).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this respect, Leon is a Hero who has fought against many enemies, although the time he has lived is not comparable to ours. It is not surprising that Leon&#39;s experience is superior to that of Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why, even though Zalario was taking it easy on him, he was able to win the game without using any of his powers against the overwhelmingly different opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why Leon said to Zalario</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You have not used your power for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario asked him, to which he replied with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He replied with a smile, &quot;No problem. I can deal with you now without any hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s attitude was as if he wanted to prove himself to Zalario, and Zalario could not help but laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll be happy to play with you later,&quot; he said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He dismisses the question and turns his attention to Milim, whom he can now see.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks around at his friends waiting in the distance and confirms that they are all ready.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru was a masterful man, and his lineup was superb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This way, they would be able to launch a wave attack on Milim without wasting time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei is also visible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is standing still in the air, or rather floating in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is unnecessary in the midst of battle, but he does not seem to intend it, and I guess he cannot stop it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, Leon and Zalario are on both sides of Souei.

I will induce Milim&#39;s behavior by repeating a series of attacks, and then I will invoke &#39;Void God (Azathoth)&#39; to create an opportunity for Feldway&#39;s interference with Milim&#39;s thoughts and actions. Regalia Dominion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon and Zalario supported me with their all-out attacks, so I think my success rate increased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the most powerful attack by Benimaru, Souei, Leon, Zalario, and the above four from the wave attack by Magus. Even Milim should stop his movement and defend himself at least a little.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the summary of the plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the moment of decision comes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim was about to attack the tree, but he stopped in the air.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The attack of Magus started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if it was a beautifully staged event, the beam cannons were emitted in a single, unwavering movement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally, I would have admired the scene, but now was not the time to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could see that the ray of light was a high power heat ray equivalent to nuclear magic: Nuclear Cannon. A robot weapon that can shoot such a beam of light in rapid succession, Ertan has a great hidden gem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, let&#39;s talk about that some other time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As expected, Milim is not a match for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s precise command has focused the rays of light to a single point. The focal point temperature is over a hundred million degrees Celsius, and it seems to be in trouble, but Milim can&#39;t see it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim doesn&#39;t understand it, because it doesn&#39;t even take a defensive posture and ignores them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It looks flashy, but is this attack meaningful?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It </span><span class="c3">distracted Milim and bought a little time</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, oh... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s almost meaningless, but it did its job, didn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, Milim puts his hands out in front of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn&#39;t seem to be distracted at all, and no matter what I do, it won&#39;t work at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, I can only rely on the attacks of Benimaru and others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei made the first move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;A thousand hand shadow kills!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei&#39;s shadow grew and became a thousand hands to capture Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though Souei&#39;s power, the Ultimate Gift &#39;Moon King Tsukuyomi&#39;, was activated with all his might, he could not even stop Milim&#39;s movement for a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And &#39;Insta-kill&#39; would never work.

It was clothed in the shimmer of &quot;star particles&quot; and completely prevented even the spirit attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was definitely better than &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39;s &#39;Absolute Defense&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s technique was so powerful that even I had a hard time with it, but it ended without much effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the attack was not the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before the result of Leon&#39;s attack, Zalario also made his move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Insanity Hash&quot;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario, who is the epitome of quality and strength, seemed to accept Benimaru&#39;s instruction without any resistance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would not make any mistake if he promised to cooperate with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seemed to think that it is the duty of a soldier to obey his commander, even if he is the enemy, and he was a surprisingly trustworthy man even though he was the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time as Souei&#39;s attack, Zalario is performing a move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know how he did it, but it was a technique that he had never shown even when he was fighting against Leon and Souei.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s hard sword, which can cut even alienium&#39;s exoskeleton in two, has the power to kill just by swinging it. Now, it is aimed at Milim with the intent to kill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The existence value, estimated to be over 20 million, was no exaggeration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a blow with a higher density of sword pressure than Souei&#39;s and Leon&#39;s attacks combined, and it was a blow of divine speed to the point of stupidity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, however.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s invisible barrier glowed brightly, but that was all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was an unbelievable sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each of them must have been too powerful to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, to Milim, it did not seem to make much sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that was enough time for Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru has a fearless smile on his mouth as if he is showing his true belligerent character.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, here comes the real work!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei, Leon, and Zalario move accordingly, though they do not actually say it out loud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was as planned from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s &quot;Kohlen&quot; was shining beautifully red in his hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a terrifying red light that would burn away all matter, but it mingled with Benimaru&#39;s blackened haki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Prominence Acceleration!&quot;Prominence Acceleration! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a radiance like the black sun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The jet-black darkness was colored by red flames.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The black and crimson sunlight with vicious violence took the shape of an oriental dragon. Then, as if it had a will of its own, it swirled and attacked Milim, trying to swallow him up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim had no choice but to react to this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because Benimaru&#39;s prominence-accelerated excitation of the sunlit black flame recorded tens of millions of energies, even though it was instantaneous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power is calculated by the relationship between the output and the amount of energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter how much energy is used, if the output is low, the power is weak. On the other hand, no matter how large the output is, if the energy level is low, the power cannot be high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the case of Benimaru, the power output was perfect. The total amount of energy was not small, but it was not enough to fight against Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could Benimaru have unleashed such a super-powerful special move?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&quot;I have lent him the power of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the Master.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not aware of any symptoms at all, Ciel-san, but what are you doing on your own?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I don&#39;t have a problem if it helps everyone, but you should have explained it to me first... </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We </span><span class="c3">were still in the experimental stage, so we thought we&#39;d report back after we had succeeded</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmmm, too much perfectionism as usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess it&#39;s just a minor experiment from Ciel-san&#39;s point of view, but it&#39;s important for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, let&#39;s not complain about it later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For now, I&#39;ll ask for an explanation of what happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san says</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-san says that my Ultimate Skill &#39;Void God (Azathoth)&#39; has an inexhaustible supply of &#39;Turn Null&#39;, an energy that is difficult to handle. Ciel-san has been studying how to utilize this energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a part of such experiments, he approached some executives to negotiate with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought to myself, &quot;If that&#39;s the case, why don&#39;t I do the experiment myself?</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I would never </span><span class="c3">put the Master in danger</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He denied it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought it would be safer in the labyrinth, but Ciel-san seemed to be unable to tolerate such a situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was too overprotective, but I guess he should be thankful that I was his target... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, Ciel-san had devised and built a system to supply the energy of &#39;Turn Null&#39; secretly to some people who are connected to me through &#39;Soul Corridor&#39;. Ciel-san had devised and built a system to supply the &#39;Turn Null&#39; energy to some people connected to me and the &quot;Soul Corridor&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was truly Ciel-sensei in his element.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In principle, it seemed to be an application of &#39;supply and demand&#39;, but it was also a very effective way to use the Ultimate Skill &#39;Void God (Azathoth)&#39; and &#39;Harvest King (Shub-Niggurath)&#39;. (Shub-Niggurath)&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The secret of Benimaru&#39;s instantaneous surge of power was this - the &#39;nihilistic supply&#39; - although this mechanism seems to be still in its infancy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>...</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.4f1mdlm"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Prominence acceleration of the sunlit black flame bites Milim as if to wrap around him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s movement stops as he tries to shake it off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Manipulation Yosei Binding Formation&quot; (Souei&#39;s yarns are used to bind Milim.) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei&#39;s yokyu (thread) seizes Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hundred Split Light Prison </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At Leon&#39;s will, the cage of &quot;Disintegration&quot; is completed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The invisible barrier twinkles like a star, but Milim&#39;s Drago Nova is not activated. This bought them enough time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Zalario did not seem to have any capturing technique, and he only applied pressure with haki. It was effective enough, but it was a secret that I felt it was not enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, the ideal situation is set.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, too, am ready. To make sure that everyone&#39;s hard work is not in vain, we must make this a success.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ciel-sensei!</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Leave it to me</span><span class="c0">!</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to ask for Skill&#39;s help at the critical moment, but Ciel-san and I are one and the same, so it&#39;s just as if I&#39;m doing my best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After I have armed myself with a perfect theory like this, I wait for the results while bracing myself.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&quot;Reset</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It worked very easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seems that Ciel-san also understood the power of the &#39;Justice King (Michael)&#39; and was able to cancel the influence by duplicating it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Feldway&#39;s &#39;Regalia Dominion&#39;, which had been affecting Milim, completely lost its effect in that instant.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hooray for a successful operation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We would like to congratulate everyone for their good work, but Milim is still in a state of out of control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The order to Milim to destroy the sacred tree was lifted, but the problem was not over yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we continued to fight here, the aftermath of the battle alone would cause Sarion to suffer tremendous damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We needed to move...there was the Republic of Ur-Gracia or something around Sarion, and across the sea, there was the country of Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Western Nations are spread out in the opposite direction, so the best route to minimize the damage would be to lead them to the barren land via the sea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This would affect the territory controlled by Dagruel, but it&#39;s too late for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, we do not want to cause damage to the people living in the area, so we have to evacuate the area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a case, it is Souei.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Souei, I am going to lead Milim to the barren land now, but I don&#39;t want the people of Dagruel to be harmed. Can you do that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told him the gist of what I was going to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sure enough, the answer came back as I expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leave it to me. I&#39;ve left a &#39;Clone&#39; for such an eventuality, so I can move immediately. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei, the workman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s a good worker.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Normally, I wouldn&#39;t think of &#39;that may happen,&#39; but with Souei, it&#39;s understandable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei&#39;s ability as a man was demonstrated again, and I felt happy today though I usually feel sarcastic about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was so relieved to know that I can handle this situation, that I left it to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was relieved, but then something terrible happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Time stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who did not read the situation and did something unnecessary ! -I complained inwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No problem if Milim stops too, but it is working as a matter of course. Moreover, during Time Stop, the world&#39;s defense power is zero, so Milim running amok has become an extremely dangerous existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if it is dangerous, just touching it now would be out of the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not a good idea to fight him here, and the only place to lead him is the Deadly Desert.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is good that we have distracted Milim before he goes on a rampage, but if we continue to lead him away, we will not be able to reach the evacuation route that Souei has requested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are hardly any uninhabited places in the world, and destroying the ecosystem before that is a problem in itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This way, Milim!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shouted to get Milim&#39;s attention and started moving anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a disgusting turn of events, but I&#39;m now in an aerial combat with Milim in the &quot;Suspended World&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I had not been able to handle Time Stop, it would have ended at this point. I appreciate that, but it is hard to fight Milim in this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel that my strength is being drained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Milim&#39;s strength seems to be inexhaustible, and it is increasing rapidly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is so obvious that one can find the answer to this question with elementary school-level arithmetic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are doomed at this rate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world is about to collapse, and while I don&#39;t like the idea of that, I don&#39;t know who is stopping time in the first place, so I&#39;m going to exclude Chloe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chloe is ruled out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guy or Velzard is a possibility, but I don&#39;t think it makes sense since they are also among those who can move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who did the unnecessary thing... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a perfect way to harass the victim, but is this really the right time to use it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are not in a position to look for the culprit like this, but we need to find out who did it in order to solve this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Rimuru, can you hear me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veldora spoke to me on &#39;Telepathy Net&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be precise, &#39;thought information&#39; is transmitted via &#39;Soul Corridor&#39;. In &quot;Suspended World&quot;, it is almost impossible to use magicule-based skills, so it is difficult to transmit even information, except for exceptions like us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, Veldora is not affected by Time Stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a wonder, of course... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes, yes, I can hear you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What are you talking about! The situation here is that Shion and Luminas are in danger ! Adalmann and the others are having a hard time too... but no one can stand against Dagruel&#39;s &#39;Time Stop&#39;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Yeah? Was it Dagruel who stopped time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes, that&#39;s right. Dagruel was the one who wanted to end the game quickly!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see. The culprit is suddenly revealed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that they are fighting with Shion&#39;s group, I guess they must have been &#39;Spatial Transportation&#39; with their whole army, as I had feared. That&#39;s OK, Shion&#39;s group must have worked hard enough to make Dagruel take them seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suspended World&#39; is only meant to cut off the legs of the weak, but it is very useful against those who can&#39;t cope with it. I got hit by it myself, and I didn&#39;t think I could even use Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, what to do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are two problems here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first is that Shion and Luminas will be wiped out if no one comes to their rescue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second problem was the means of transportation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spatial Transportation&#39; in Time Stop is basically impossible because it requires flying &quot;information particles&quot; to understand the surrounding information. It is basically impossible. Although it is possible to move within the visible range, it is meaningless because it is faster to move normally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is because, regardless of the distance, the coordinates of the destination must be read by interfering with the &quot;information particle&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the &quot;information particle&quot; has to be moved back and forth, it would be faster to move itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, even if I go to the rescue now, Dagruel will finish his complete control of the area before I can reach Lubelius.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The result would be the same whether I went there or asked Veldora.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And since I was dealing with Milim, Veldora was the only one I could ask... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Veldora, even if you can&#39;t make it in time, will you go to the rescue right now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve been waiting for you to say that!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had hoped that Veldora would be in charge of the final defense of the labyrinth. However, now is not the time to talk about such things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now it&#39;s time to find a means of transportation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru-sama, Ultima and &#39;thought&#39; are connected. I&#39;ll send the coordinates to Veldora-sama. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh ?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Diablo who interrupted the conversation at this point.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">Spatial Transportation&#39; is possible even in the &#39;Suspended World&#39; as long as the coordinate information is known even at a long distance. .&quot; &quot;We have Ultima on site.

I couldn&#39;t help but feel angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But my thoughts were calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I was aware of what was happening around me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;I can&#39;t believe it... I never thought that the Dragon Princess had such a big power... no, it&#39;s more than that...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s betrayal was a problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know how it happened, but even Zalario was helping Milim to bind him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was a serious problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t care about the allegiance to Feldway or anything like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Jahil, the problem was that he would have no allies in the region.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it was only Kagali and his men, he could defeat them as it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, if even Zalario became Jahil&#39;s enemy, it would be difficult for him even to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Feldway, you&#39;re talking out of turn ! &#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an angry &#39;Telepathy Net&#39;, Jahil chastised Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a short silence, Feldway responds in a muttered voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Zalario betrayed us...?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is no time for foolishness! I&#39;m in danger. I&#39;m going to retreat, is that alright with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil is already moving to retreat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is humiliating for Jahil to face the inferior opponent, but his cautiousness is the reason why he has been able to survive until now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Otherwise, he would have been obliterated by Milim&#39;s attack long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil took hold of the Origin Blood. He releases his unused power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of Origin Blood is strong. Jahil is forcing himself to admit that he is the master, but it is dangerous to use it too much because of its repulsive power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it is true that it is the ultimate weapon that can be relied upon when the time comes. When its power and Jahil&#39;s authority are combined, it can create a wide-spread Evil Blood Wave that can vaporize even the largest of nations, and it can be used with great ferocity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In principle, it is the same as the so-called vaporization bomb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By burning magicules scattered over a wide area at once, an explosion of flames is generated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil has not been fighting randomly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While fighting off Teare and Silvia, he has also been secretly spraying magicules.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was spreading so much that it filled the battlefield, transforming into a hellfire full of murderous intent at any time at Jahil&#39;s will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(They would withstand my wide-range Evil Blood Wave, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">) Since it is a wide-range technique against the military, it lacks decisive power against the strong. However, it is impossible to survive against a Greater majin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The widely scattered magicules cover Sarion&#39;s magus. Zalario&#39;s men will also be engulfed and burned to the ground, but that is not Jahil&#39;s concern. It was the perfect distraction to save his own life, so he did not hesitate to go through with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You woodchoppers, you know how great I am !!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil shouted, and then he exploded and burned with a wide range of Evil Blood Wave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sacred tree was engulfed in flames.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The epidermis exploded with super-high heat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magus, which had been deployed vertically and horizontally to protect the tree, was also engulfed by the flames in that instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia and Teare, who were standing in front of Jahil, and Kagali, who was a little behind him, are also in the flames, unable to react.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Giggle, giggle, giggle! Fuck you, you inbreds ! You&#39;ll regret your insults to me in the afterlife!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil, with a hearty laugh, sneaks away to hide behind the flames.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The flames were so intense that they were threatening to consume the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as soon as Jahil was out of sight</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, man, thank God you&#39;re not paying attention,&quot; Benimaru says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru said, and all the flames were drowned out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It looked like it was going to be a catastrophe, but the damage turned out to be minor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia, Teare, and Kagali did not suffer a single burn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Magus, who was the most dangerous of the three, was unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although some of the &#39;magic rider&#39; who were exposed to the instantaneous heat seemed to be unable to move, their bodies were protected, and they did not suffer serious injuries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tree was supposed to have burst into flames, but although the surface of the tree was scorched, each and every branch was still fresh. This is proof that the tree is not as damaged as it looks, and it will be restored to its original state in a few days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh my God, it was so hard to control the air without Jahil noticing, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s Elmesia (Your Majesty), isn&#39;t it? As I expected, you took appropriate measures.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru smiles briskly as if he is appeasing Elmesia who is complaining.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As can be seen from this exchange, the reason why there was little damage from the widespread Evil Blood Wave was because Benimaru was working behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s workload was so outstanding that it could be called his &quot;all-around great activity&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was assisting the Kagali group against Jahil while daring the operation to stop Milim. In addition, he noticed Jahil&#39;s plan and negotiated with Elmesia to stop it before it could cause any damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The magicule spread by Jahil&#39;s power was a special flammable substance called &quot;bloodmist&quot; to be precise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vampires sometimes used it in their techniques, which was one of the powers of the Origin Blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has a smell that is slightly different from that of naturally occurring magicule. Benimaru detected it through precise &#39;Magic Power Manipulation&#39; and knew that Jahil was up to something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a matter of fact, there was one other person besides Benimaru who had noticed this anomaly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silvia immediately sensed the danger, but she had no idea what to do about it. We could escape from the danger by evacuating as much as possible, but there would still be people who would suffer damage. Moreover, if we made a move, Jahil might speed up his action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was worried about what to do and asked Benimaru for advice, because I expected that the damage would be more widespread.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru, who had been aware of the situation, was able to grasp the situation accurately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That alone is a great achievement, but it does not mean that he came up with a solution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The answer came from the heavens.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">Collect only Blood Mist with Elmesia&#39;s Ultimate Skill &#39;King of Wind Heaven (Vayu)&#39;, and use the Ultimate Skill &#39;Heat King (Amaterasu)&#39; to burn only the demon blood</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon hearing this, Benimaru acted without doubts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are some things in this world that are better not to pursue too deeply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had heard this &quot;voice&quot; when Rimuru connected the energy circuit of &#39;Turn Null&#39; to him. But Benimaru pretended that he did not notice anything and accepted everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Everything is in the will of Rimuru-sama. If this heavenly voice is working in Rimuru-sama&#39;s favor, I will obey it.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Benimaru made such a decision and was active both in front and behind the scenes. He obtained cooperation from Elmesia and others and overcame the difficulty this time, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, Jahil&#39;s plan was thwarted by the efforts of Benimaru, Silvia, and Elmesia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Jahil himself was allowed to escape, Benimaru decided that he should not take any chances with his limited resources, and this was the best outcome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When everything was settled, Benimaru collapsed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He saw that Jahil had escaped and relaxed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Souei, perhaps anticipating this, quickly supports him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No wonder, he did such a great job!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia&#39;s eyes were full of respect as she looked at the unconscious Benimaru, and her words were kind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Elmesia&#39;s point of view, Benimaru was a champion who saved Sarion from a crisis. Knowing how hard Benimaru had worked, it was natural for Elmesia to react in this way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Benimaru aside, Elmesia&#39;s work still remained to be done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most important of these was to deal with Zalario and his army, which was still alive and well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia worried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jahil&#39;s escape has kept the battlefield in a lull.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both sides are waiting to see how the other side will react, and Elmesia is wondering whether or not the war should be restarted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since Benimaru had moved to neutralize Jahil&#39;s attack, Zalario&#39;s forces had not suffered any damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, Sarion&#39;s forces were slightly worse off than Jahil&#39;s. The endgame was not that much of a threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The end of the army is not that much of a threat, but the two enemy generals are really troublesome, and the troubles are endless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the first place, it was uncertain whether the enemy would agree to a truce or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia is thinking at a very high speed, simulating various possibilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But his worries were soon to be over before the results were known.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dhalis and Nice were in charge of the Zalario forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He and her followers had been defeated in the previous undead-elf incarnation race, and their egos had been extinguished. The Thorone class was weak-willed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We had been fighting for a long time... no, on the contrary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is because of the repetition of the same work for a long time without any change that their souls were worn out and their egos faded away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the reasons for this may be that Zalario was a warrior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast is the army of Obera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The camaraderie was strong in Obera&#39;s corps, and everyone loved Obera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were many killed in battle, and Oma was the only deputy left, but they were all valiant warriors who were willing to risk their lives for Obera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s army, on the other hand, was a mechanical force, organized and disciplined. There was no need for ego, and they were mere cogs in a wheel that only did what they were ordered to do, and that is how they achieved results.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For this reason, Zalario had few true comrades, and now there are only two: Dhalis and Nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They approached Zalario and asked him a question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That man Benimaru, he seems to have been thinking of protecting us as well. We had to suspend the battle as a result.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Zalario-sama, are you sure? We betrayed Feldway-sama, didn&#39;t we?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dhalis confirmed in a matter-of-fact, clerical manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nice is considering Zalario and is implicitly asking him about his future policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario thought that this question was interesting because of the difference in direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Surprisingly, personalities are born, aren&#39;t they?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had not noticed it before, but Zalario&#39;s lieutenants also have their own opinions. Zalario was pleased with this fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh, you guys are serious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;&quot;- ? &quot;&quot;&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Zalario smiled, Dhalis and Nice were astonished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were astonished to the point of astonishment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was no wonder that Zalario&#39;s smile had never existed in their memories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The, Zalario-sama?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is this some kind of a trick ? Or are they testing us?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario controls the upset deputies with his hand and spins his words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Calm down. We&#39;ve decided that further fighting is pointless. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What ? What? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a formal declaration of the end of the battle from Zalario&#39;s mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dhalis was surprised, but had no objection. He obeys and passes the order on to the entire army.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, Nice, I did not betray Feldway. On the contrary. He took my free will away from me, and he has dishonored the trust we have placed in him as a friend!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario says this with quiet anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a declaration of farewell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, from now on, you and Feldway-sama...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Nice asked fearfully, Zalario nodded his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario nodded his head. I have decided to part company with Feldway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This statement made not only Nice but also Dhalis gasp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Fortunately, you guys didn&#39;t have the Ultimate Skill. You have not been given the Ultimate Enchantment and you are still free to defend your ego. You may continue to follow me, or you may join Feldway. I will give you a moment to make your choice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dhalis and Nice were confused by this sudden proposal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wow, you don&#39;t need us anymore?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Have I made some kind of a mistake?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was upset like that, but Zalario calmed her down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No,&quot; he says. I, too, have been freed from the domination and have realized the importance of freedom. You, too, should look at the beauty of this world. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two of them looked around again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sky was cloudless and clear, as if the previous turmoil had been a lie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sacred tree, protected from the threat of Milim, stands majestically, though its charred bark is still visible. Its branches spread wide as if supporting the sky, and its huge lush green leaves were growing thickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A pleasant breeze blows over the Zalarios gathered on the leaves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a breath of fresh air that blows away old ideas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We are now at truce with the enemies of the insectar, who have been enemies for a long time. I was going to follow Feldway as a favor to my friends, but I can&#39;t tolerate his way of being. I am going to find a new way of life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario told him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He clearly declared that he was not going to follow him even if he was not righteous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, although Zalario was a warrior, he had no taste for finding new enemies. He was fighting only because he had to, not because fighting itself was his purpose in life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have been forced to fight for a long time, but maybe it is time to look for something else. Zalario thinks so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his lieutenants agreed with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;- Actually, I have been thinking a lot since I have been inhabiting my undead self. It seems that my body is inhabited by the will of someone else, and if I am allowed to do so, I would like to find a hobby other than fighting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dhalis confided hesitantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t have any particular thoughts about it,&quot; Dhalis said. I will follow Zalario-sama for the rest of my life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nice&#39;s will is firm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being useful to Zalario was Nice&#39;s only consistent wish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I forgive you.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario accepted the offer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario was determined to live freely, but not irresponsibly. He would not abandon those who loved him and those who followed him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If that&#39;s the case, so am I. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you sure? I&#39;ll never stop looking for a hobby. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;fufufu, it would be fun to find a hobby, but I&#39;m not in a hurry. Let&#39;s wait until everyone is settled.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s a good idea, Zalario thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their life would go on. It would not be a bad idea to slow down and rethink what we should do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For that, he needed to lead the world to peace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then we have found our next goal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world is so beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, Feldway did not even look at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, Feldway is the one who is disturbing the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a friend, Zalario thought that he could not overlook this outrage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen! The enemy is Feldway ! Let&#39;s defeat his delusional ambitions and stabilize the world!&quot;&#39;&quot;&quot;Yes! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes!&quot;&quot;&#39;&quot;&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s army is as united as a cog in a wheel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, too, the decision was unanimous.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At Zalario&#39;s order, all the generals disarmed at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t see any point in further combat, do you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zalario, who went to Elmesia alone, said so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia agreed with Zalario&#39;s statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I agree. It seems that you did not like the battle either, so let&#39;s call it a draw. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elmesia&#39;s statement was tantamount to a declaration that she would not hold the war accountable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although a ruler should take compensation from the aggressor, Elmesia made this proposal in order to force an end to the war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The royal families supported this proposal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, they had no choice but to support it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In effect, the continuation of further fighting was a matter of national survival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magus is badly damaged, but the &#39;magic rider&#39; can be repaired. However, if the battle continues, there will be many casualties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The loss of life cannot be compensated for with money, and the nation&#39;s strength will inevitably decline. The upheaval by Feldway was expected to continue in the future, and the war effort could not be wasted at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fortunately, no leader was foolish enough not to understand this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The emperor&#39;s decision was not disputed, and everyone agreed with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The summit conference between Elmesia and Zalario resulted in a successful conclusion of the war agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following this, a declaration of collaboration was issued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thus, for the time being, Zalario&#39;s army was stationed in Sarion to prepare for the unprecedented crisis that lay ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="line.jpg" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 56.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking down from above, Feldway was aware of the entire battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Zalario betrayed me...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a shock to Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The departure of Zalario, one of his few confidants and old friends, was something Feldway had never imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why he is mad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Losing Michael and being betrayed by Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is only after losing him that he realizes how much it meant to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#65288;Are you abandoning me too?

We could have destroyed it later.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Zalario&#39;s departure was not as planned, it was true that Feldway&#39;s plan was intact. So Feldway&#39;s confidence is not shaken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time of doom is near.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any lingering doubts in his mind are gone with the thought of being betrayed by Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is as if Feldway is now driven by only one purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is why he will not stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Vega, you&#39;re going to work with Dino to conquer the labyrinth.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh? Finally, it&#39;s my turn!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vega laughs happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mai, who had been standing by his side, stands up at the sight of Feldway. Vega and the others cannot leave the &quot;Heavenly Star Palace&quot; because they have not been given the &quot;key&quot;. Mai, who has been given a duplicate of the key, is able to send Vega and the others on their way with an &quot;Instantaneous Movement&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Incidentally, the key from the other world to the Heavenly Star Palace is also in Feldway&#39;s possession. But the key to Heaven&#39;s Tower, which leads from the palace to earth, only belongs to Velzard. Velzard was the only one who had it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the Cardinal World is already registered in the &quot;key&quot; possessed by the Feldway group, so there is no longer any inconvenience for them to move around. Mai and others have duplicated &quot;keys&quot; in their Ultimate Enchantment, so they can move to &quot;Heavenly Star Palace&quot; from anywhere. Mai, for example, has a duplicated &quot;key&quot; built into the Ultimate Enchantment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This &quot;key&quot; is also given to Dino and his friends, but they are not so happy about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What, me too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s reaction was ignored.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now that Veldora, the biggest player in the labyrinth, is gone, this is the perfect opportunity. No matter what Dino said, the decision would not be reversed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Expect good news!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these words, Vega leaves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mai led the way, followed by a drooping Dino, and then Pico and Gracia took their leave.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence fell over the &quot;Heavenly Star Palace&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway, who remained alone, smiled in a very amused way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a big smile with a hint of madness.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px;"><img alt="ph_slime20_ill013.jpg" src="images/image28.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 864.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Then, looking down at the ground, Feldway begins to move himself for the final touch.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.19c6y18"></a><a id="id.2u6wntf"></a><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px;"><img alt="p-015.png" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 606.67px; height: 862.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.3tbugp1"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was guiding Milim toward the barren land, I suddenly had a bad feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had a bad feeling that what I was doing now was exactly what Feldway had intended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess it was a feeling I realized only because I was often moved according to Ciel-san&#39;s intention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I think it is just an assumption... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I questioned the situation itself that the only destination is there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we are to be guided, it should be there - &quot;Heaven&#39;s Tower&quot;, that&#39;s for sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, inside the tower is a relic of God so strong that even Michael&#39;s attack is completely blocked. The surrounding deadly desert is also consistent with the goal of preventing further damage by Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sorry to Dagruel, but it is also convenient that we are now in hostilities. After all, it does not hurt my conscience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I feel sorry for him, but I also feel that it is inevitable since we are enemies. So, I can accept that this is a force majeure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, &quot;Heaven&#39;s Tower&quot; was the only way to lead Milim to the site.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I&#39;m thinking too much... </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">No way</span><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t think that Feldway is more than Ciel-san expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, the battle just now was a feat that could not have been accomplished without Zalario&#39;s cooperation, and there is no way that he could have foreseen it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they had known that Zalario would turn, they could have done something else... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, there was no use in worrying here, but I felt bad somehow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was feeling a little uncomfortable, but I was not sure if it was because I was thinking &quot;I&#39;m not sure what to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I received a nasty report from Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rimuru, I&#39;m in trouble ! &#39; &#39;Yes, yes, we are in trouble too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was about to reply, &#39;Yes, yes, we are in trouble too,&#39; but Ramiris continued faster than that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dino-chan and the others attacked us! We&#39;re ready to intercept them, but I&#39;m worried because my master isn&#39;t here ! &#39; &#39;Oh, I don&#39;t like it... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, I hate it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I hadn&#39;t asked Veldora, I would still be in &quot;Suspended World&quot;. Dagruel&#39;s power is as strong as that of &quot;True Dragon&quot;, so it seems that he can keep time suspended for quite a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we let Milim run amok in such a state, the tree would have been destroyed long ago, and we did not know where the repercussions would have been.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I must have been right in my judgment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can only say good luck to you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Hey, I don&#39;t want to hear your answer like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I understand. But I&#39;m also trying to deal with Milim right now...&#39;&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;I can&#39;t get in touch with Benimaru either! So if you don&#39;t come back soon, it&#39;s going to be a problem for me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand that Ramiris is worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lack of communication with Benimaru is probably due to the fact that he has pushed himself too hard. I have confirmed that he is safe, and since there seems to be nothing wrong with him, I think he will recover soon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Anyway, hang in there for a while!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I understand, but really, please come back soon...&#39;&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After some complaining, the communication with Ramiris was finally over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wish he would be more considerate of me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it is true that this is no time for jokes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The battle between Guy and Velzard is still going on without any intervention by others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is an intruder in the labyrinth and the battle is about to intensify.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim is still running amok, and we don&#39;t even have a clue how to stop him.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If </span><span class="c3">only someone could deal with Milim for a few moments, he could be stopped by the Regalia Dominion...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hate to think of it, but worst case scenario, it&#39;s inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That said, we&#39;re still in trouble because we don&#39;t have that someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just to release Feldway&#39;s order is enough to make Benimaru fall down. Even if we ask him to do the same thing again, it would be impossible until he regains his strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this situation, it seems that the attacker is responding appropriately to the attacker&#39;s move after seeing it. I didn&#39;t think that they would take advantage of me so much, even though the attacker has the advantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am looking for an opportunity to counterattack somehow, but I am not ready for Milim&#39;s onslaught, though it seems that I have enough time because I am thinking like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leading them on means that Milim is after you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no way I can afford to do anything about Feldway, so I try my best to neutralize Milim&#39;s attack, and I go toward &quot;Heaven&#39;s Tower&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, I could see it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heaven&#39;s Tower should be able to withstand Milim&#39;s attacks. Once I was inside the tower, I should feel a little better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But sadly, my bad premonition turned out to be right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you, Demon Lord Rimuru.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A voice from the heavens reaches my ears as I am paired with Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a malevolent voice from Feldway, descending to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Damn, they&#39;re after us, aren&#39;t they!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I click my tongue, but it is already too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could think what to do, Ciel-san rushed to warn me.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot; </span><span class="c3">Leave this place immediately!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From his unusual appearance, there was no doubt that this was an emergency situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;retreat,&quot; but in short, he told us to run away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As much as I would like to do so, I can&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I&#39;m paired with Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is exactly what Feldway wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s the worst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason I was not panicking was that I knew perfectly what was going to happen next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway&#39;s next move was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Come on, Milim! Follow me again, Regalia Dominion!&quot;Regalia Dominion!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, I knew it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did the final move that I&#39;ve been worried about for a while, without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Milim has lost his power. From the looks of it, it seems that Feldway has taken control of him again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is good that Milim&#39;s outburst has been stopped, but I am sure that he will turn his attention to me - this is what we call a &quot;king&#39;s move&quot;, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I had to fight Milim in addition to Feldway, there was no chance for me to win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t play with me, you coward!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t care if you think I&#39;m a sore loser or a howling loser, but I at least want to complain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feldway laughed at me as if he was looking down on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re a pussy, Demon Lord Rimuru. You&#39;re in my way, and I&#39;m going to make you disappear.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe he wasn&#39;t laughing at me, but approving of me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because Feldway ran away from me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was sure that Feldway, who had Milim as a pawn, would try to beat me two to one, but surprisingly, he did not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Blast away to the end of space-time!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a familiar phenomenon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the same attack that had wiped Velgrynd-san out of this world a while ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Feldway&#39;s space-time transfer had transported me to some unknown &quot;place&quot; in the past, the future, or the present, I&#39;m not sure which.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a id="id.28h4qwu"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Postscript</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, I finished the 20th volume of my book.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was told that I would not extend the deadline this time, but the truth is that I had a lot of problems and it was really hard work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be more specific, I was in a slump.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was mentally not motivated to write at all...rather, I was in a situation where I would come up with a scene, but I couldn&#39;t concentrate on it when I was writing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is true that I had a lot of work to do in addition to writing the book, so my energy was quite low. But even so, this was the first time that I had ever felt so much of a lack of motivation to write.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had no choice but to take the final measure of changing the environment in which I write. I was worried about how it would turn out, but I went to Tokyo to enjoy hotel life. I stayed at the hotel and tried my best to live a life of writing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, at my own expense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I was told that the publisher could publish my book, but I felt that it would increase the pressure to write more and more, which I didn&#39;t like. I was worried about the case when I couldn&#39;t write, so I refused the offer, saying that I didn&#39;t want to be trapped any more and that I would pay for it by myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, I was able to complete my quota every day, as if it was a lie that I had not been able to write for three months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess the environment is very important. It is more important than anything else to have a regular life and to keep the rhythm of writing. I know that, but it&#39;s not easy... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would like to thank the hotel staff for their kindness. I was so comfortable that I didn&#39;t want to go back home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I-san, who was in charge of the hotel, said to me with a straight face, &quot;Don&#39;t you have to go back? I-san said with a straight face, but it didn&#39;t sound like a joke to me... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I-san is probably serious, so I will try my best not to be so (smiles).</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">During my stay in Tokyo, I had a chance to meet with some writers, and some of them said they are in the same situation as I am. It seems that many of them are mentally damaged because they cannot go out because of the corona.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many of you may have increased your work at home due to the corona, and people like me, who are not good at self-control, may be experiencing the same kind of suffering, to a greater or lesser extent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In such a case, it is important to have a change of pace!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Please take a break and try not to overdo it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hope that my work &#39;That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime&#39; will be of some help to you and give you peace of mind.
