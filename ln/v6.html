The infiltration was hard - much harder than anticipated, but escaping from there was even more difficult. No ordinary man can get through that even with multiple lives... 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_38"><span>「That’s because I have faith in you. That, and you can’t be killed anyways」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_39"><span>「I see you’re still as cruel as ever.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_40"><span>Laplace begins fake crying, but the young man continues without displaying any emotions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_41"><span>「So, what did you learn from investigating the Western Saints Church? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_42"><span>「——About that.... I really don’t wanna say this but…… I seriously can’t find anything.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_43"><span>The young man remains impassive as he listens to Laplace’s report.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_44"><span>His reaction, or lack thereof, towards this report makes it feel almost as if he expected to hear it; he lets out a grin and replies:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_45"><span>「Oi——why are you doing this again, why can’t you ever just be honest? You’ve probably already discovered something by now, haven’t you?」</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Note for future Laplace dialogue as well. He talks with a very heavy kansai accent, which is a Japanese dialect. One can say that he sounds more thuggish than other characters." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_46"><span>Laplace shrugs and sighs upon hearing the young man’s reply.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_47"><span>「Ya got me there. These pieces of information were all really difficult to obtain, and I was planning to sell them at a high price. Yet you’ve seen through me like it was nothing. I’ll accept this defeat.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_48"><span>「Hehehe, it makes me happy to hear your praises like this. But still, don’t expect a bonus, okay? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_49"><span>Hearing this, Laplace sighs: 「What a mean character.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_50"><span>「Hey now, don’t say that. I did say I’d give you the payment as agreed upon. Anyway, the consciousness of “that thing” has already been settled. I’ve transferred the 『Demon Lord』inside me into the body of a homunculus.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_51"><span>The young man smiles gleefully at this declaration. He then rings a bell and summons the secretary that seemed to have been waiting outside of the room. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_52"><span>「Did you summon me?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_53"><span>She looks elegant and dignified - a model secretary through and through. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_54"><span>Her beauty is decorated by pure, white skin which perfectly accentuates her braided blonde hair. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_55"><span>Her eyes are bright blue in colour as if shining with mysterious lazurite.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_56"><span>However, while the light in her eyes looks enthralling somehow, it does not seem to bear ill will. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_57"><span>「Huh? Eh, could you be…?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_58"><span>Laplace becomes suspicious of the woman’s appearance, yet in her eyes, Laplace finds a familiar presence. He then seems to recognize her true identity, and the realization quells his inner confusion. He bursts into laughter.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_59"><span>「Why are ya dressing like this? Has your highness undergone a sex change? I’d say it hardly suits you to dress like this. It’s completely different from what you used to look like.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_60"><span>「Shut up. It took me ten years to obtain a body that I can move around freely in. These types of inconveniences are more than tolerable.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_61"><span>The woman replies rudely, not willing to let Laplace berate her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_62"><span>Her model secretary like behavior disappears as she intimately pats Laplace on the shoulder and lets out ruffian laughter without a care. Then she sits down on a chair. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_63"><span>「So, you letting me meet this guy means I can put down the act now, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_64"><span>「No, I hope you can still keep up the act at least on the outside. But since we’re all familiar with each other here, it would be unnecessary. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_65"><span>「Oh? I suppose I’ll just do as the boss says then. But for what reason exactly?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_66"><span>「About that, it’s because currently you are still too weak, Kazaream. You’ve yet to recover your full power, right? Until you’ve regained your full strength as the 『Cursed Lord』, you should just sit back and observe Clayman.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_67"><span>Kazaream, the woman who looks like a secretary, sighed with discontent at his reply.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_68"><span>Kazaream.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_69"><span>That is the name of an ancient demon lord. There once was a human named Leon who proclaimed himself a Demon Lord near the border of Kazaream’s domain. Kazaream had then attempted to punish Leon for such bold declarations but was unsuccessful in the end.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_70"><span>And this former Demon Lord Kazaream is the being that both Demon Lord Clayman and Laplace wish to revive, and who also happens to be the president of the Moderate Jester Troupes. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_71"><span>Yet nowadays, Kazaraem is no longer in possession of such power and thus assumes the body of a fragile woman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_72"><span>While near death, Kazaream was able to possess the flesh of this young man in a fateful encounter and thus cheated death. A few days earlier the former Demon Lord’s Astral Body was finally successfully transferred to the physical body of this homunculus.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_73"><span>Right now, his power is much weaker than it was during the days of his prime. As a result, Kazaream decided to recognize the young man as his master and to serve as his subordinate. This was the agreement between Kazaream and the young man, which is why he made no objections.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_74"><span>Having spent his time with the young man for ten years, Kazaraem fully recognized him as his master.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_75"><span>「That’s right. My power has yet to fully recover. I was defeated by that Demon Lord Leon so badly that I even lost my physical body. Sure my soul is able to settle in this homunculus, but this body is too fragile. If I am to fully release my </span><span>magicule</span><span>s within it, it would completely destroy this body. That wouldn’t be a revival at all...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_76"><span>「Is that so, now I see. So even the president is calling you boss. In that case, I too shall accept you as my boss. You are no longer just another client. I guess there’s no reason to hide anything from you anymore.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_77"><span>「Seriously? You are one stubborn idiot. We’ve been collaborating for so long, and I even helped you revive your most precious president. Yet you still wouldn’t believe me till now... 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_78"><span>「Hahaha, that’s a totally different matter. Speaking of which, the president taking on the appearance of a super model is absolutely hilarious!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_79"><span>「——Is that so? I don’t really care about my appearance.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_80"><span>「No no no, the contrast between how ya look and how ya talk is just too much; it’s absolutely hilarious.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_81"><span>「Whatev——No, I understand now. If I must keep up this act, I need to talk more like a woman.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_82"><span>「No no no, that isn’t the problem here, is it? Anyhow, it kinda suits ya </span><span>bett</span><span>er.... But, how should I put this… </span><span>WHAHAHAHA</span><span>!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_83"><span>Laplace bursts into laughter, unable to continue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_84"><span>「Oh now, please shut your trap. It’s not like I wanted to end up like this. This body is a Sorcerer’s Dynasty Sarion’s specially modified homunculus that boss has prepared just for me. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_85"><span>「Yeah. It’s quite expensive. If we didn’t prepare the container devoid of a soul, it may have contaminated the transferred soul, resulting in a failed transfer. Speaking of which, if Kazaream hadn’t escaped into my body, it might have already been mixed up with impurities and would have made it impossible to separate. In other words, I can’t really help with how it looks.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_86"><span>「I really appreciate that, Boss.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_87"><span>But there was no joy in the voice of this young man and Kazaream expresses gratitude towards him.</span><span>&nbsp;Even so, he still seems rather irritated and was only able to bring his good mood back after Laplace joined in expressing thanks. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_88"><span>「I guess I’ll let it go this time. I get that you two must be experiencing a lot of feelings right now, reuniting after such a long time, but I want to talk business now. Let's hear the results of your investigations, Laplace. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_89"><span>With that, Kazaream loses his smile and turns towards Laplace. Laplace also nods back, changing his attitude, and starts talking in a more serious manner:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_90"><span>「Since you kept your part of this bargain and granted my wish, I would like to show you my sincerity as well. I’ve infiltrated the Western Saints Church, wishing to discover its secrets. Yet I was unable to discover any deeper truths.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_91"><span>Laplace says as he begins to describe his investigation in detail. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_92"><span>Laplace’s mission this time was to investigate the secrets hidden within the organisation called the 『Western Saints Church』.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_93"><span>This organization in particular is based in the Holy Empire <span data-term="Ruberios" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and claims to be an independent religious organization. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_94"><span>They portray themselves as「The Just Protectors of The Weak」and have significant influence over the western states. To the young man, this organization stands as an obstacle between him and his goals. This is why he hired Laplace, a member of the Moderate Jester Troupe jack of all trades, to help find any exploitable weaknesses.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_95"><span>The young man believes that there’s a hidden dark side to the Western Saints Church. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_96"><span>If they are indeed agents of justice as they’re meant to be, he will have to resort to damaging their reputation by any means possible. But that would be his last draw.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_97"><span>Now is not the time to strike yet. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_98"><span>This is because the Western Saints Church also happens to have the strongest of the Saints, the Commander of the Holy Imperial Guards, Hinata Sakaguchi.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_99"><span>However, Laplace isn’t finished yet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_100"><span>「And then, since Hinata was absent, I got to infiltrate the church, but I didn’t find anything suspicious. So I decided to go to the Holy City of <span data-term="Ruberios" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and check out the holy 『Inner Sanctum』 at the top of the Spirit Mountain. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_101"><span>As he becomes more and more excited with his explanation, Laplace begins to gesticulate with his hands </span><span>and feet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_102"><span>There, he witnessed something with his own eyes. A fearsome truth that he laid eyes upon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_103"><span>「I was real surprised, you know. The holy land was filled with a holy aura. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_104"><span>「Isn’t that only natural? It’s a holy land after all.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_105"><span>「Did ya hit your head or what? Have you become dumber since I last saw you?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_106"><span>「No way, I definitely did not! By the way, president, your old tone is back again.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_107"><span>「Again with the same shi(t)——My business is irrelevant. Please proceed. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_108"><span>Skeptical about the treatment he’s receiving, Laplace continues to report everything he saw.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_109"><span>………………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_110"><span>…………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_111"><span>……</span></p><p class="line" id="line_112"><span>After sneaking past the Western Saints Church headquarters, Laplace found himself before the Temple of Gods. This is the hall of the Pope, who acts as the Agent of God, but it is also the place where politics are managed. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_113"><span>As he entered the Temple of Gods, he started to feel something is amiss with the surroundings. He sensed a weak flow of magic that would affect one’s psyche. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_114"><span>Laplace possesses the unique skill 「Deceiver」and because of its defense mechanism, he was able to detect the existence of such intricate magic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_115"><span>That’s a surprise. I didn’t anticipate there to be mental magic on par with my own here....</span></p><p class="line" id="line_116"><span>From there on, Laplace became more cautious and proceeded towards the Holy Church carefully. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_117"><span>Laplace had some knowledge about the enemy organization. However, he had little to no idea about the connection between this Western Saints Church and the Holy Empire <span data-term="Ruberios" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_118"><span>The Western Saints Church worships the monotheistic god Ruminas as their deity.

They are the </span><span>real </span><span>issue. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_124"><span>They are the strongest human knights—— and the Holy Knight Order consists of many of these holy knights.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_125"><span>Even Laplace considers them to be difficult to deal with.

This regiment serving the Pope is another difficult organization to deal with.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_130"><span>They preach the saying “in God’s name, all men are born equal”, which allowed them to garner a variety of talents to serve in the Order. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_131"><span>The conditions for joining are very straight forward: be a faithful follower of Ruminas and have combat capability above Level A.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_132"><span>The conditions seem simple on paper but are more difficult to achieve in practice, which is why the number of knights in the regiment is so small. However, they are all exceptional fighters or mages who are allowed to recruit their own subordinates. This is why the Imperial Guards are not a force to be trifled with. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_133"><span>Even within such a powerful organization, Hinata is still said to be head and shoulders above everyone else as the top knight.

I really thought I would die there.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_180"><span>「Or rather…… why haven’t you died yet?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_181"><span>The young man teases upon hearing Laplace’s mumbling. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_182"><span>Kazaream jests, astonished: 「Meh, you probably can’t kill this guy even if you wanted to.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_183"><span>「It’s really annoying; shouldn’t ensuring an escape route and one’s own safety be common sense? But, I feel as though I’ve been getting beat-downs all the time lately. So it’s about time for me to act cool for once and show off what I am made of a little.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_184"><span>「Yeah, yeah. But your role is to be a spy, so I’d advise you to not try anything crazy.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_185"><span>「Yeah, Laplace. The goal is the important thing, playing cool is irrelevant, no?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_186"><span>「Sure, you are both right. I’ll just allow them to beat me more. I may even become a masochist one day.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_187"><span>「Why does that matter? It makes no difference if you lose.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_188"><span>「Yeah, just to live on and win at the last moment is enough. Speaking of which——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_189"><span>Kazaream’s expression becomes serious upon reaching this point in the conversation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_190"><span>Laplace also nods in response:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_191"><span>「Yes, yes, the more important issue is that he was able to beat the crap out of me, meaning that guy is definitely strong. The question here is, who really is this guy? Logically, the question is how could such a strong Majin appear in a holy place like that? That’s definitely the breaking point. Could this revelation develop into an issue to shake the foundation of the Western Saints Church?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_192"><span>「Majin… The Western Saints Church has connections with even Majin, and on top of that, a high ranking Vampire... 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_193"><span>Laplace, as if in sync with the other’s thoughts, pushes towards the core issue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_194"><span>The young man nods in agreement. However, he is unable to hide the shock on his face at such an unexpected turn of events.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_195"><span>「Now this may be an issue. The man who beat Laplace, according to my available knowledge, can’t be just a simple Majin.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_196"><span>「Indeed. I agree.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_197"><span>「Hmm, how so?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_198"><span>The young man responds dubiously, despite what Kazaream and Laplace believe..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_199"><span>「I’m not trying to brag here, but I am strong. For instance, against that Dryad back then, had I fought her earnestly, she wouldn’t have stood a chance. I just thought it was disadvantageous to fight in the forest, plus it would get real annoying real fast if she called for backup. That’s why I decided to run. There wasn’t really any point in fighting her. However, that guy was different. His strength could rival a demon lord. That’s why running away was my only option. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_200"><span>In the forest, the Dryads are particularly powerful. Due to their racial attributes, they can teleport to anywhere within the forest instantaneously through the touch of any vegetation within their domain. Not only that, they are able to “share” all their information among members of their own race. That’s why under such circumstances, their companions would surely come to her aid. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_201"><span>Dryads are a difficult race to deal with, and it’s for this Laplace had decided to flee. If it were only one Dryad, Laplace would be confident in his victory. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_202"><span>However, it’s different this time. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_203"><span>「That guy was a monster. Definitely stronger than me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_204"><span>Laplace asserts with confidence.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_205"><span>The air in the room suddenly grows heavier.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_206"><span>「I see, a Demon Lord….. Kazaream, what do you think?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_207"><span>Kazaream sighs.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_208"><span>「As I said——we may be in trouble. To my knowledge, there’s only one person that fits the description.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_209"><span>「Oh？ And who would that be?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_210"><span>The young man asks upon seeing that Kazaream is beating around the bush.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_211"><span>「——Demon Lord Valentine. One of the ancient Demon Lords whose strength rivaled mine when I was in my prime.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_212"><span>「Yeah, no wonder. If he can fight the president on even footing, fleeing was definitely the right call. I’m glad I followed my instincts.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_213"><span>Laplace shrugs as he responds.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_214"><span>He went through all the trouble of infiltrating the Church when Hinata was away, yet encountering a Demon Lord?——His expression tells the whole story. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_215"><span>「.......Hmm——The Demon Lord resides within the Western Saints Church. Could it be——that the Pope is in fact Demon Lord Valentine?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_216"><span>「Who knows? It’s strange that a Demon Lord would seek help from the humans. President, what is this Valentine guy like?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_217"><span>Upon receiving the attention of both the young man and Laplace, Kazaream begins to recall the past.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_218"><span>He begins to knock his temple elegantly with his slim fingers, closing his eyes as he looks back on a series of events in the past.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_219"><span>「Despite how I look right now, I’ve survived three of the great wars that have plagued the lands every five hundred years. &nbsp;This certified me as one of the ancient Demon Lords. However, when I formally became a Demon Lord, there were already six others——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_220"><span>Starting with that, Kazaream begins to tell the story.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_221"><span>Demon Lord Valentine himself has far more experience as a Demon Lord compared to Kazaream. With immense amounts of power, the title of King of the Undead Vampires is not a title just for show. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_222"><span>The Demon Lord Valentine, who himself is the symbol of the undead, has always alarmed Kazaream who had evolved from the long-living elven race to the undead race.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_223"><span>「——As a matter of fact, I’ve fought against Valentine several times. But never did it amount to anything. When beings like us start fighting, even if we ourselves remain unharmed, our surroundings sustain heavy damages. That’s why we began sitting down and talking things over——this later developed into a system which decides on issues based on majority of votes——the Walpurgis Banquet.</span><span>&nbsp;And the reason why any decision would be passed with three votes is a tradition inherited from the time where there were only seven demon lords.</span><span>」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_224"><span>Or perhaps it’s because everyone was too lazy to change it——Kazaream laughs elegantly. Kazaream's voice fluctuates between masculine and feminine, and while it is creepy, the owner of said voice doesn't seem to notice.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_225"><span>Kazaream’s smile gives way to a stern look as the story continues:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_226"><span>「I’d say, as someone who has fought against Valentine, he only ever sees humans and demi-humans as tools . There is absolutely no way that man would go and become a guardian of humanity. &nbsp;」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_227"><span>Laplace nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_228"><span>The young man also begins to mull over Kazaream’s words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_229"><span>「Right, then should we make a deal with him?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_230"><span>「Come on Laplace. Remember, a deal is something that all parties involved have to agree to.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_231"><span>「Oh yeah…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_232"><span>Knowing that he is not equal to the other party, Laplace immediately banishes that thought. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_233"><span>「In addition, someone as stubborn as Hinata would never collaborate with a Demon Lord. Which means the Vampire Laplace encountered must have just been some insignificant Majin instead of the real Demon Lord, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_234"><span>The young man claims, seemingly in agreement with Laplace. However, Kazaream disagrees.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_235"><span>「No, I’m sure that was Valentine. I’ve heard of the swaths of red beams attack before, and there’s no mistaking it. Valentine's title was 『Overlord of Fresh Blood』, and he’s specialized in the ability 『Blood Flash Shockwave,』 which turns blood into beams of magical particles.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_236"><span>It is said that the &nbsp;「Blood Flash Shockwave」 is a diffusing particle beam. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_237"><span>It turns one’s blood into magical particles and thrusts it out as a violent barrage——The only person who has the magicule reserves to pull this off is, without a doubt, Demon Lord Valentine, concludes Kazaream. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_238"><span>If that’s the case….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_239"><span>「In other words, the Vampire who Laplace fought is most definitely Demon Lord Valentine. However, he would never collaborate with humans. If that’s true, the only conclusion we can draw is that the Pope must be Demon Lord Valentine, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_240"><span>「It’s possible….. and the most logical conclusion to make. But it’s still confusing as to how he’s able to keep Hinata in the dark about all this.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_241"><span>Seeing the other two hum in agreement, Kazaream also expresses his own agreement. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_242"><span>「Indeed, that would be the most reasonable explanation. Although I still have my doubts, there are things that just don’t add up…… But right now our focus should be the location that Valentine resides, where only the Pope could enter.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_243"><span>He says as he lists out the facts obtained so far.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_244"><span>「Let me confirm this again, he is a real Demon Lord, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_245"><span>「Most likely. His appearance is rather identical to my recollection. On top of that, Demon Lord Valentine’s pride would never allow him to work for anyone but himself...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_246"><span>「That’s right, there aren't many Majin who are stronger than I am. If that kind of monster exists in that place, any investigations in the future may very well be in jeopardy.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_247"><span>Since Kazaream and Laplace hold the same view, the young man also begins to accept the hypothesis that the Pope could very well be Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_248"><span>「Anyhow, this information is highly valuable. You’ve outdone yourself this time, Laplace.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_249"><span>The young man is definitely elated to have obtained such a trump card to bring down the Western Saints Church. He shows no sign of concern despite learning that the enemy is backed by a powerful demon lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_250"><span>Based on the newly obtained information, the young man now begins to plan out his next move. As such, he enjoys the scheming of the coming events….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_251"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_252"><span>「My report ends there. By the way, how are things progressing on Clayman’s side?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_253"><span>Laplace asks as he suddenly recalls that upon finishing his report.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_254"><span>The young man shows an annoyed expression of displeasure at the question. He brushes up his shining dark hair and replies with a complaining tone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_255"><span>「Well about that… he messed up.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_256"><span>「Did he fail?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_257"><span>「Yeah. It was all smooth sailing until we had Hinata duel that slime you mentioned. However, things somehow didn’t go according to plan afterwards…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_258"><span>The young man says as he begins to briefly explain the turn of events.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_259"><span>At the start, Clayman was successful in bringing Demon Lord Milim to his side thanks to the secret jewelry the young man gifted him——all thanks to the dominating orb’s magic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_260"><span>In order to examine its effectiveness, he’d have to confirm the extent of influence the orb had on Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_261"><span>「And so we decided to have Milim fight an appropriately powerful individual to test out her strength. Demon Lords are all cunning and unfathomably powerful beings, so we decided to use the least intelligent-looking <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as the test subject. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_262"><span>Kazaream also joins the explanation after the young man.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_263"><span>「And to top it off, the capital of Yuurazania could be taken down in the process. There are many ex-human slaves that reside there, and their souls could be used to awaken Clayman as a </span><span>true </span><span>Demon Lord. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_264"><span>As they say so, the young man and Kazaream looks at each other and sigh </span><span>simultaneously</span><span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_265"><span>「To use them for Clayman’s awakening...talk about killing two birds with one stone.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_266"><span>「But then Milim went out of control and decided to give a war declaration by herself.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_267"><span>In the end, <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his men got an extra week to prepare themselves, which allowed the people residing within the capital to seek refuge elsewhere.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_268"><span>「As expected, manipulating Demon Lords with magic items is no simple task. We need to make sure to give more detailed commands next time before we try anything else.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_269"><span>「You gotta have a bit of faith in me. I’m exceptionally good with mind manipulation magic, you know! My title 『Cursed King』 isn’t just for show. I made that domination orb myself; it is an incredible piece of magical equipment. The only reason our plan got messed up is because of that incompetent bastard Clayman.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_270"><span>「It’s all water under the bridge at this point now. Anyway, the soul collection plan at Beast Kingdom failed so we set our sights on the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_271"><span>「<span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_272"><span>「Yeah, that country where they performed the summoning rituals in-house and gathered a number of </span><span>otherworld</span><span>ers. And because of that, I thought it was about time to reduce their influence a bit. I secretly found someone to leak some information regarding the Monster Kingdom and caught the interest of that greedy king and his subordinates.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_273"><span>「And given how greedy they are, they took the bait really hard.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_274"><span>The original plan of creating a new Demon Lord out of the Orc Lord failed spectacularly, so based on Laplace’s report they decided on another plan——Instigate the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom to invade the Jura-Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_275"><span>That Kingdom has several high level Majin and we get to have them kill each other against those otherworlders from <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_276"><span>It just so perfectly happens that Rimuru, the leader of that nation, was acting alone outside his country when Clayman’s subordinate infiltrated it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_277"><span>Rimuru was the ideal bait to draw Hinata out for a fight; the plan is truly killing two birds with one stone. However——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_278"><span>「But to our surprise, that slime named Rimuru was able to escape from Hinata! This is one slime that we absolutely cannot afford to overlook, just like you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_279"><span>「That’s a rather sharp jab….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_280"><span>「There’s even worse things to come——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_281"><span>「In my opinion, <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s victory was all but guaranteed. However, once the leader of the </span><span>monster</span><span>s gets involved, the situation may very well be turned. But honestly, it makes little difference as to who wins. We would just have to negotiate with the side that wins. The real objective is to cause enough casualties——and gather souls. And I had thought we’d use those souls to help awaken our cute little Clayman, but...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_282"><span>It was a complete failure.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_283"><span>The grand army of <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was completely decimated by a single slime.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_284"><span>「Unbelievable right, but it’s the truth.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_285"><span>「It’s the first time for me to have my plans derailed like this, even with my unique skill 「Planner」.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_286"><span>The young man is very disappointed and Kazaream looks quite upset about it as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_287"><span>「H-hold on!

That’s just madness………...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_291"><span>Laplace was completely baffled to discover this series of bizarre events. However, more surprising new information awaits.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_292"><span>「What’s more, according to Clayman’s post-war reconnaissance of the battlefield, he claims that all the corpses have disappeared.

On top of that, those aren’t your run of the mill normal corpses; they’re all highly trained soldiers. The negative emotions on the battlefield have also created the perfect environment for casting this type of magic. With all of these conditions combined, one can expect to &nbsp;summon monsters that can at least rival a Demon Lord.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_294"><span>「Is it even possible? The way I see it, it’s our loss that we couldn’t retrieve the souls. According to Clayman, he couldn’t even acquire a single soul at the scene, so his awakening plan is once again in shambles.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_295"><span>Says the young man as he lets out a sigh.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_296"><span>The young man laments his losses and reflects that the reason for all of this failure was because he has been operating on too many fronts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_297"><span>Over-emphasizing efficiency and neglecting each individual strategy, that’s why they’ve been failing at every step along the way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_298"><span>Perhaps I am being too greedy</span><span>——thought the young man.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_299"><span>「Could it be that the slime named Rimuru was the one that harvested all those souls?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_300"><span>「What nonsense are you suggesting, Laplace? That’s a feat beyond even a Demon Lord, so how could a single Majin manage that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_301"><span>Kazaream is right.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_302"><span>The collection of 20000 souls as well controlling them would be a difficult task even for someone skilled in the art of magic. If one is to proceed without considering their own limitations, it will no doubt result in losing control of the souls.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_303"><span>Besides, if someone did pull that off successfully——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_304"><span>「Hahaha, yeah right, Laplace. If this guy takes twenty-thousand souls in one sitting then he’s probably evolved into a monster by now, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_305"><span>The young man smirks at the possibility.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_306"><span>「I suppose you’re correct. I might be overthinking this a bit too much, having so many bad thoughts running around in my head.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_307"><span>Laplace’s doubts are ridiculed by the other two believing it to be an unfathomable idea.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_308"><span>The conditions necessary to awaken as a True Demon Lord——That’s something even Kazaream doesn’t know in its entirety. If anything, it would probably require an insane number of souls.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_309"><span>In order to confirm such a hypothesis, they’d decided to use Clayman as a lab rat. Clayman also attempted to experiment using the Orc Lord. However, all of these plans have since, to their annoyance, failed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_310"><span>Under such circumstances, even someone as calculated as Kazaream could not have expected a slime of all things to out of nowhere evolve into a「True Demon Lord」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_311"><span>But Laplace’s guess has been right all along, it’s just that the three have yet to discover it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_312"><span>「Speaking of which, what’s Clayman been up to lately ...?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_313"><span>Having infiltrated the Western Church and almost dying in the process, Laplace thought that Clayman would probably understand his hardship. His eyes drift off as he asked dubiously.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_314"><span>「He’s currently on standby. As it stands right now, it’s better to be acting cautiously. But thanks to Milim doing what she said she would, the Beast Kingdom has now been turned to dust. For now, we’ll slow down our pace and reassess our future strategies.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_315"><span>「Oh? So not all of our plans have ended in complete failure?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_316"><span>「Oi oi, are you mocking me, Laplace? Even with most of my power lost, strategizing is still my specialty.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_317"><span>「That’s right. I’ll be really angry if all my plans just went awry like this! Despite the many setbacks to our plans, we are, at least, still successful in weakening the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom. Consequently, the Western Nations will be more unified from now on, making it easier for us to control.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_318"><span>「And the Jura Forest can act as a defense against invasions from the Eastern Empire.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_319"><span>「I see. So president, if we are going to negotiate with the winning forces, then there’s no need to destroy the M</span><span>onster</span><span>&nbsp;Kingdom.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_320"><span>Laplace fully agrees with the two.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_321"><span>Plans that change according to the circumstances to ensure that they are always profitable——These are the abilities possessed by Kazaream’s unique skill 「Planner」. Laplace recalls this and praises it in heart 「He sure has his way.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_322"><span>「Milim defeated <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which proves the domination orb is indeed effective. Our display of power should stop here, and we should wait to see how the other Demon Lords react.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_323"><span>「Right. That’s why we’ve ordered Clayman to be on standby. The Eastern Empire is going to take action anyways, so there will be more chances for him to collect souls. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_324"><span>「Additionally, the Western Saints Church is also onto the M</span><span>onster</span><span>&nbsp;Kingdom, so keeping that country around should make things more convenient for us.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_325"><span>So that’s why you two are saying there’s no need to rush... Laplace realizes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_326"><span>「Which means, our enemy at the moment is just the Western Saints Church?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_327"><span>「That would be it for the time being.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_328"><span>「However, things aren’t as simple as that. We must assume the enemy forces consist of both saints and Demon Lords, so it would be too dangerous to act without exercising caution.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_329"><span>They don’t want to have a direct confrontation with the Church as they want to avoid disputes with the various other forces. Laplace asks if that is the current plan, to which the young man nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_330"><span>The </span><span>Monster Kingdom</span><span>&nbsp;will no doubt become an obstacle after they seize control of the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_331"><span>Apart from that, there is another reason.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_332"><span>They must reflect and take to heart the reasons of their continued failure. Next time, they must carefully assess their enemies and avoid taking a double-front approach.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_333"><span>The Western Saints Church and the Holy Empire <span data-term="Ruberios" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> behind it. These are the high priority enemies that they need to strike down first. This time, they need to be cautious and avoid leaving traces…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_334"><span>This is why it’s rather convenient to have the </span><span>Monster Kingdom</span><span>&nbsp;around for the time being. By exploiting the Western Saints Church’s doctrines, they can have the attention of people such as Hinata since she will focus on the </span><span>monster</span><span>s.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_335"><span>「The Church definitely won’t ignore a Majin like Rimuru. After the defeat of the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom, it’s unlikely that they could convince the rest of the Western Nations to wage a holy crusade. But in order to avoid the loss of faith, they will definitely need to make a move.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_336"><span>「Indeed. If we are able to intervene somehow and instigate the two parties, they may kill each other off. We just need to wait for both sides’ strength to decline. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_337"><span>Says the young man with an evil grin.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_338"><span>That Majin alone annihilated 20,000 trained soldiers by himself. No one could deal with him except for Hinata. The young man must have concocted many plans waiting for this moment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_339"><span>The arrangement of plans seem to be done. There is not a single sound of hesitation in the young man’s voice as he explains them to Laplace.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_340"><span>「But the things you reported are beyond our planning, Laplace.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_341"><span>「Yeah. I can’t believe that the Demon Lord Valentine came to mess things up. Could they actually be collaborating? Knowing Hinata’s personality, she would never collaborate with a Demon Lord.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_342"><span>Both the young man and Kazaream note with a hint of anger. The tone itself is almost like saying that it would be much easier to deal with the Western Church if Demon Lord Valentine were never involved.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_343"><span>It’s not like it’s my fault.</span><span>&nbsp;Laplace feels rather embarrassed as he tries to find an excuse for himself:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_344"><span>「I know. How about we draw out the Demon Lord to remove him from obstructing our investigation?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_345"><span>「Hmm? What do you mean, Laplace?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_346"><span>「Think about it, we only need to mention it to Clayman and tell him to convene the Banquet. Right now the Demon Lord Frey is on his side and so is Milim. Three Demon Lords should be enough to initiate a meeting.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_347"><span>The Walpurgis Banquet——As long as the meeting is being held, all the Demon Lords will be drawn to show up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_348"><span>「——I see. In this way we’ll be able to draw Demon Lord Valentine out of <span data-term="Ruberios" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_349"><span>The young man nodded with a smile, having accepted Laplace’s proposal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_350"><span>「Oh, it’s rather rare for Laplace to act smart for once. Trying to find an opportunity to lure Hinata out of the holy lands again so your investigation can proceed.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_351"><span>「Huh?! Why me again?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_352"><span>「It’s only natural.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_353"><span>「You don’t say?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_354"><span>Come on, seriously?</span><span>——Laplace thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_355"><span>But neither the young man nor Kazaream seem to care.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_356"><span>As such, without Laplace’s consensus, the Majins begin to draft a new plan.</span></p><a id="line_357" class="line"></a><h2 class="text-center strong line" id="line_358"><span>Chapter 1</span></h2><p class="text-center line" id="line_359"><span>Meeting of Man and Monster</span></p><hr class="line" id="line_360"><p class="line" id="line_361"><span>Clayman didn’t overestimate his power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_362"><span>He had taken over all the land owned by Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_363"><span>After the defeat of Kazaream at the hands of Demon Lord Leon, all of Kazaream’s previous subordinates went to submit themselves to Clayman’s reign.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_364"><span>Clayman took over Kazaream’s domain.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_365"><span>The other Demon Lords did not object to it and the merging process afterwards proceeded smoothly. Everything was unfolding according to Demon Lord Kazaream’s precautionary plan which he devised for times like this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_366"><span>Clayman gradually expanded his territory and became a force to be reckoned with as a new Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_367"><span>Among all the Demon Lords, Clayman holds the greatest amount of wealth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_368"><span>To be more specific, Clayman is the only one who knows how to exploit financial situations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_369"><span>He’s been secretly trading with the Eastern Empire and has established a healthy trade relationship with Dwargon. Through these trading channels, he was able to import the latest models of weapons and armor from the major players in both the east and the west.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_370"><span>Clayman is able to use his predecessor’s legacy and magic to improve the combat capabilities of his subordinates, as well as recruit Majins who crave power. Clayman excels at luring Majins by using great wealth and then manipulating them..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_371"><span>Not only that, but he’s been scheming behind the scenes with all the profits gained through his relentless spending. This helped Clayman form a web of connections between different countries while simultaneously keeping them all in the dark.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_372"><span>Everything was going according to Clayman’s plans, and he had all the information he needed to maintain the control. Thus, his plan of world domination was already halfway complete…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_373"><span>All he lacks now is power, and Clayman is very aware of that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_374"><span>Victory in a war is determined by the number of combatants.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_375"><span>Clayman holds such a view, and for that reason, he never puts himself on a pedestal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_376"><span>He knows all too well that no matter how much power one can accumulate before a war, there’s still a possibility that one could suffer a complete defeat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_377"><span>He thought that Kazaream underestimated his opponent too much. And thus the defeat of that Demon Lord raised a giant red flag.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_378"><span>That’s why Clayman stood firmly in the center of all major powers and cautiously planned his expansion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_379"><span>Nowadays, Clayman has finally gained a trump card in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_380"><span>Demon Lord Milim——Her ferocious techniques are second to none, and she is able to surpass many of her peers within the Ten Great Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_381"><span>She went to destroy an entire country on her own without a single care, even though Demon Lord <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is more powerful than Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_382"><span>Clayman is very delighted now that he has obtained the strength he always lacked.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_383"><span>He wishes full-heartedly to eliminate Demon Lord Leon and believes that he would have his wish granted soon enough.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_384"><span>But, before that could happen….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_385"><span>Hehehe, “That Lord” is truly something. He reached the same conclusion as I did. To have the annoying Saints’ Church fend off the Majin Rimuru. This is the most efficient way to reduce the strength of both parties.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_386"><span>He won’t have to worry once the enemies begin to kill each other——This was Clayman’s plot.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_387"><span>In order to execute the mission of investigating the hidden truths within the Western Saints Church, and to confirm their ties with Demon Lord Valentine…. All I need to do is to coordinate with Laplace to give him an opening to sneak in once more during the Walpurgis Banquet, when their defense would definitely be slacking. What a perfect plan!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_388"><span>Clayman sips his wine with great joy, savoring the taste.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_389"><span>The taste of the hundred-year wine is definitely worthy of someone of his stature. </span><span>It’s as if he’s tasting the amount of work and hardship put into the wine to make it that way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_390"><span>It has been strictly maintained as the most classy </span><span>merchandise</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="I get what it's trying to say but &quot;merchandise&quot; ain't doing it justice (and I can't use &quot;thing&quot;)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="possibly &quot;vintage&quot;" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>, kept in great care until the day someone opens and tastes it——It has been cared for that much, just for Clayman alone to drink it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_391"><span>This is only natural to Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_392"><span>He is a really graceful king.

Now would be a good time to take all of <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s territory.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_401"><span>「But Clayman, didn’t boss tell ya to stay put?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_402"><span>Suddenly, the echoing sound questioning him fills up the empty room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_403"><span>But Clayman didn’t seem to panic at all, he merely puts on a smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_404"><span>「So you are here, Laplace? You are as cunning as always.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_405"><span>「No way you didn’t realize that. Have ya been thinking too hard lately?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_406"><span>「Hohoho, that can’t be helped. I’ve had two chances to awaken, yet I’ve missed them both due to my miscalculations.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_407"><span>「Don’t be so harsh on yourself. The president has already made a prediction that the Eastern Empire would make a move soon!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_408"><span>「Perhaps. But Laplace, I’ve come up with a good idea. Now that their capital is destroyed, there are many weak races remaining around the territory of the Beast Kingdom. I want to take over <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s land before any other demon lords gather all the survivors, and then kill them.This way, I’ll get to awaken at long last. So, wouldn’t you agree that this is a great plan?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_409"><span>Despite how Clayman phrased that, Laplace doesn’t think highly of it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_410"><span>「That sounds rather inappropriate; isn’t it a bit too cruel? Wouldn’t you be overdoing it if you just kill all those weaklings without even knowing the conditions of awakening?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_411"><span>Clayman isn’t pleased with Laplace’s disagreement and directs a stern glare towards him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_412"><span>「Laplace, that doesn’t sound like you at all. Are you sympathizing with them? We follow the rule of survival of the fittest, so aren’t they lucky that they would die for me? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_413"><span>「But you remember that time you killed thousands of human slaves and it did not change a thing, right? What did that amount to? You can’t turn back time once you’ve done it, so you’d better think things over now and act cautiously.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_414"><span>Laplace is right. Clayman once bought and massacred thousands of slaves, yet he failed to evolve into a 「True Demon Lord」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_415"><span>However, Clayman is still not convinced even with Laplace pointing out the flaws.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_416"><span>「You are overthinking it, Laplace. I do whatever I please with my bought goods. If killing a thousand won’t do, I’ll just have to kill ten thousand. Since I already know it is necessary to have human souls for the awakening, there is no need to show mercy to the weak!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_417"><span>Clayman expresses his arrogant point of view. And, attempting to sway Laplace’s opinion, he continued:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_418"><span>「Besides, this type of mission is also beneficial for “That Lord”. 『A new force has risen in the Great Forest of Jura. In addition, the Lord there dares to proclaim himself a Demon Lord.』 I’ve decided to use that as a reason to invoke the Walpurgis Banquet.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_419"><span>「Right, that should work as an excuse. But this proposal doesn’t constitute any reason to invade the Beast Kingdom still, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_420"><span>「Of course, Laplace. 『During my investigation, my subordinate <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was murdered by that guy.

She acts as a perfect support role in her line of work. Apart from that, she always looked as if she’s unwilling to do her job, which is why Laplace and the others often talk to her in order to encourage her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_434"><span>The most important part is that she has a normal set of values despite serving someone like Clayman. Simply for that reason alone, Laplace commemorates her highly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_435"><span>However, Clayman’s expression remains unchanged as he answers Laplace.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_436"><span>「Yeah, I don’t know what you are lamenting over, but <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has been killed.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_437"><span>「Really?

At least try to mourn her for a second, okay?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_440"><span>Laplace is rather sad seeing Clayman’s cold reaction and decided to try and &nbsp;persuade him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_441"><span>This guy wasn’t so terrible before. His personality seems to have been twisted ever since he became a demon lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_442"><span>Not only Clayman...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_443"><span>All of Laplace’s companions within the Moderate Clown Troupe began to develop twisted personalities. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_444"><span>Laplace is the same, so he can’t really lecture Clayman about it. Although Laplace is aware of that, he still believes that Clayman has changed a lot compared to before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_445"><span>「Hahaha, you are such a nice person Laplace. Tear once told me as well that you should cherish your tools. Didn’t you teach her that, Laplace? That’s precisely the issue. My tool is broken, so I must punish the one who broke it. Wouldn’t that comfort the spirit of my tool in heaven?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_446"><span>Laplace decides to give up on the issue after seeing Clayman’s evil smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_447"><span>「........you’re right. At least don’t let her die in vain.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_448"><span>「Right? I know you would do that.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_449"><span>Clayman grins after saying that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_450"><span>That’s not what I meant…….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_451"><span>Laplace has rather mixed feelings seeing that laughing face, but he decides to change his mood and instead examine the potential flaws Clayman’s plan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_452"><span>「By the way, Clayman, about the Walpurgis Banquet, would anyone object to the meeting?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_453"><span>Laplace expresses his doubts, while Clayman’s smile also fades away.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_454"><span>「It’s possible that there will likely be voices of objection. But right now, I can manipulate Milim however I wish. I’ll send her to play with whoever dares to object.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_455"><span>Clayman’s expression twists with confidence and greed as he says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_456"><span>Hearing this, Laplace pales.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_457"><span>「Whoa hold on a sec, that idea is way too dangerous! That guy also mentioned that Milim may act out of control anytime. Even though the president made that magical orb himself, you should not be so careless, shouldn’t you?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_458"><span>「It’s fine, Laplace. Milim is already following my every order.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_459"><span>「I’ve heard of it, but didn’t she act on her own and declare a war by herself? Manipulating the ancient Demon Lords is not an easy feat; their resistance against mental control is probably very strong. It will be suicidal if you are going to completely rely on Demon Lord Milim!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_460"><span>Laplace tries his hardest to give Clayman some advice, but his words fall on deaf ears.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_461"><span>「Are you jealous now that Milim is in my palm, Laplace?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_462"><span>「Not at all! But you should save your trump card for the end game, no?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_463"><span>「Shut up. I don’t need you to worry for me. “That Lord” wishes to awaken me to become a true demon lord. That’s why I’ll destroy the Beast Kingdom. I’ll take care of anyone who dares to stop me!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_464"><span>「Wait a second! Didn’t that guy order the president already to have you stay put? You just need to figure out how to make it through the Banquet now!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_465"><span>Laplace again tries his hardest to convince Clayman, yet all of Laplace's words blew through his mind like the wind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_466"><span>「Trust me, Laplace. If I only follow Kazaream-sama’s plan, I won’t complete “that Lord's” wishes. Now is the time to strike.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_467"><span>Clayman declares his final stance and ends the discussion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_468"><span>In the end, Laplace couldn’t stop Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_469"><span>Clayman’s views do hold some truth, and they don’t deviate much from the orders from above. However, Laplace still finds something wrong with Clayman’s plan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_470"><span>So he proceeds with:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_471"><span>「Eh, Clayman. I’ll ask you one more question. About this operation, were you really the one that decided on it?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_472"><span>「What do you mean by that, Laplace? The only ones that can give me orders are Kazaream-sama and “that Lord”. You should know that better than anyone, shouldn’t you?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_473"><span>He’s right.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_474"><span>Since Clayman reassures there is no problem, Laplace won’t intervene any further.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_475"><span>After all, he still has a lot of work to do on his own, such as the second attempt at infiltrating the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_476"><span>「Fine, that will do. I’m leaving. But be careful Clayman! Don’t act all reckless without thinking, and you’d better not get careless.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_477"><span>After giving that advice, Laplace parts ways with Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_478"><span>As for Clayman——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_479"><span>Did he think I was under anyone’s influence? What a stupid thought. No, could it be…… that I’ve seized control over Milim’s power, and he’s afraid that I would take his reward? But being jealous isn’t really Laplace’s thing…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_480"><span>Clayman hasn’t been over-confident with his ability.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_481"><span>Right now, he’s gained another thing to boost his ego having controlled Demon Lord Milim. </span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="may need re-working" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_482"><span>That’s why he said those words to his most trusted friend, Laplace. That’s also why Clayman thought Laplace was jealous of himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_483"><span>While feeling somewhat disappointed towards his friend, Clayman took another sip of his red wine. It tastes bitter and lacks the crisp</span><span>&nbsp;sweetness</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="I can't find the right word right now hence commenting for future reference." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&quot;velvety flavour&quot;" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;from just before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_484"><span>——Annoying!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_485"><span>He suddenly hurled the glass in his hand towards the wall. Due to a feeling he himself can’t describe, he just wishes to vent his anger using whatever objects that happen to be near him. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_486"><span>The classy wine bottle that was placed on the table is shattered into pieces now. Even so, Clayman doesn’t really mind. He decides to take something out of his pocket in order to calm himself down.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_487"><span>A piece of a mask.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_488"><span>A mask with a smiling face engraved on it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_489"><span>「Don’t worry, Laplace. I’ll awaken successfully. Then, I will dominate this world . No, Laplace. I won’t lose anything else! This time, we will be together.

With that being the case, Clayman would be the best candidate for my flesh sacrifice.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_497"><span>Right now I’ve got no idea why Milim provoked <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to persuade her.

No, I should call it Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_589"><span>To be more specific, you can report whoever intends to approach me in a harmful way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_590"><span>《.....Understood——》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_591"><span>It seems to want to say something. But it’s fine. I just need to pass on all the trouble to it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_592"><span>I have faith in it. That’s how Raphael-san works.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_593"><span>I compressed my skill to minimum capacity and waited quietly for the guests to arrive.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_594"><span>Since my skill already identified them, whoever has arrived can’t be imposters. They must be the real deal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_595"><span>I didn’t have time to inform Fuze before the Pegasus knights landed before us. Immediately after, Gazel got off the back of his pegasus and greets me with a laugh:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_596"><span>「Long time no see, Rimuru. I heard rumours that you’ve become a Demon Lord. Am I right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_597"><span>No wonder why the king himself came here. Of course he’s here to talk about that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_598"><span>「I suppose, Gazel. A lot happened, so I decided to become a Demon Lord. It is quite complicated, but I’ll be drafting a series of plans.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_599"><span>I greet him so, giving him a wry smile and informing him of our meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_600"><span>「Perfect timing. Then I’ll join the conference too.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_601"><span>Gazel proclaims rather naturally.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_602"><span>Fuze still looks all battered up, but his expression suddenly changes as he closes in on me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_603"><span>「D-Demon Lord…..????? What in the world is going on????」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_604"><span>He just happened to be around to hear our conversation. He probably thought this type of thing just can’t be ignored and questioned me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_605"><span>Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that to him...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_606"><span>Right now it would only make things messier. But if I remain silent now, Fuze won’t give up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_607"><span>「Rimuru-san, I can’t just unhear what you just said! I did hear you say something about how you’ve become a Demon Lord, riiiight……?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_608"><span>Fuze shivers as he says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_609"><span>Is he holding his pee? Go ahead and do it, don’t be so polite with me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_610"><span>「Do you need to use the restroom? If so, our town’s public toilet is——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_611"><span>「NO! Who said that I want to go to the toilet!? It’s not about that, it’s about you becoming a Demon Lord…. What in the world is going on——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_612"><span>I intended to use the toilet as an excuse, but failed to get it through to Fuze.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_613"><span>Fuze also is no longer acting all respectful and is showing his true colours.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_614"><span>「Hmm. Oh, you mean the thing about the Demon Lord? I am one, yeah,」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_615"><span>I answer casually, pretending it’s no big deal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_616"><span>It’s clear he won’t let me off the hook so easily though.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_617"><span>「Hahaha, that’s such a bad joke. I do hope you can answer this seriously.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_618"><span>Eh————</span><span>Annoying. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_619"><span>Does he wish me to tell him from the start? Do we have to do it from the start? Well, King Gazel also seems intrigued to learn about it...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_620"><span>But talking while standing isn’t really convenient, so I should just make an explanation real quick.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_621"><span>I roughly recite the story to them. As a result, Fuze starts to talk to the air. It seems he’s trying to escape reality by going catatonic. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_622"><span>Oh well, At least it’s better than having him chanting doubts about my story all day.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_623"><span>I decide to leave Fuze to his own devices and talk to King Gazel again.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_624"><span>「By the way, Gazel, is it really alright if a king of a nation just departs</span><span>&nbsp;like this</span><span>?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_625"><span>That actually does concern me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_626"><span>I am equally guilty of the same crime, but King Gazel seems way too liberal with how he visits other countries.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_627"><span>The Dwarven Kingdom——The Armed Nation Dwargon —— is a powerful nation. Its national savings alone would be dozens times more than my country’s. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_628"><span>Would it really be okay if the King just moved out like this?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_629"><span>「Huh, no problem. I’ve got a body double!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_630"><span>Huh? You seem to be using your body double in the wrong place…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_631"><span>No, or is it?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_632"><span>Something doesn't feel right, but I suppose that’s how it is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_633"><span>The Pegasus commander Deruf-san as well as the other companions of the hero king have all arrived. That’s one strong group of people to bring.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_634"><span>「That’s not important, Rimuru. Is what Vesta reported to me three days ago true?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_635"><span>Gazel switches his eyes to back to those unique to a nation’s ruler and questions me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_636"><span>「It’s true, those twenty thousand——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_637"><span>「Hold on a second, Rimuru. I’ve heard that the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army has vanished for no reason. Do you know anything about this?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_638"><span>「Hmm, vanished?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_639"><span>Hmm? What is this now?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_640"><span>「Vesta reported to me that the army of twenty thousand men closing in on this town suddenly disappeared. What actually happened?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_641"><span>Gazel says slowly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_642"><span>A pair of eyes have been boring into Vesta in the corner, exerting an unseen pressure.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_643"><span>I look towards Vesta and see him shaking his head in panic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_644"><span>「Vesta, I was there during your report as well. You did mention that the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army suddenly vanished. We were curious and thus decided to come investigate. Did you find the reason for that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_645"><span>Pan is the highest commander in chief of the Dwargon army as well as King Gazel’s close ally. He also questions Vesta in a pressing tone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_646"><span>Ah, I get what’s going on.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_647"><span>Gazel is trying to cover up the fact that I massacred the twenty thousand man army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_648"><span>「Well, about that, we couldn’t get to the bottom of it...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_649"><span>Vesta also seems to understand what they mean and answered carefully. He’s been looking at Gazel and the rest’s expressions and cleverly coordinated the conversation alongside them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_650"><span>I suppose that’s how smart people do things. Vesta’s reactions are super fast. Now the mess I left has been successfully covered up.</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="marking place" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_651"><span>Gazel instead lowers his voice and whispers to me: 「Idiot! If you tell the truth now, you are making yourself an enemy of the humans!」 and similarly:『don’t bother yourself to make an enemy with the humans even though they will definitely fear you.』</span></p><p class="line" id="line_652"><span>It does make sense when I think about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_653"><span>Someone powerful enough to single-handedly wipe out an army of more than ten-thousand people. That’s more deadly and terrifying than nuclear weapons.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_654"><span>The less people who know the truth, the better. There really isn’t any need for unrelated countries and citizens to be informed about this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_655"><span>The army of <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom attempted to invade the </span><span>Monster Kingdom</span><span>, yet encountered an unknown accident, leading to their disappearance as a whole——We will package this as the truth and inform the rest of the countries of it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_656"><span>Now I see that Sasuga-King Gazel possesses the ability to deal with crises, a skill that I lack</span></p><p class="line" id="line_657"><span>So the only problem remaining is just what I’ve said.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_658"><span>It would be too late to hide it from the people in the town. But the truth doesn’t really matter to them. Everyone probably knows about it but no one would go around and run their mouth about the news.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_659"><span>Fuze happens to be the center of my concern.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_660"><span>I glance towards him. He has regained consciousness and our eyes happen to meet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_661"><span>「Ah, ah——Fuze-kun.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_662"><span>「Rimuru-san…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_663"><span>Right, what should I do now?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_664"><span>Just now I broke the breaking news to him that the entire <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army has been killed by my hands.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_665"><span>Should I tell him that all of this is just nonsense?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_666"><span>While I was still worrying, Fuze takes in a breath and sighs.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_667"><span>Then he raises both of his hands and respond:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_668"><span>「I didn’t hear anything. Of course, my men are all resting at the inn now, and they definitely won’t remember when they wake up tomorrow morning. We are so tired that they probably hallucinated and forgot everything.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_669"><span>It would seem he decided to pretend he hasn’t heard anything.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_670"><span>Fuze seems to have suddenly aged a lot, to the point that his entire body seems to be devoid of strength. There is a certain tragedy to this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_671"><span>After all, he was being so nice to have resorted to this in order to resolve the issue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_672"><span>「Gufufufufu, if that’s the case, just to be cautious, allow me to confirm it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_673"><span>The man who’s interrupted suddenly out of nowhere is Diablo, who now stands behind me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_674"><span>This Diablo is an amazing guy, too. He’s like Doraemon,</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="Closest reference to the source" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;and answers to your every need.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_675"><span>He also seems interested in doing chores.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_676"><span>I also recall hearing him whisper that he’s “good at rewriting memory”. I’ll pretend I never heard that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_677"><span>Fuze still seems troubled, but he gave in at last. He won’t intervene as long as his subordinates are kept safe and uninformed of the knowledge. He must have also agreed to King Gazel’s view that the less people who know this, the better.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_678"><span>As soon as national interest is involved, he may dispose of whoever leaks out the information in the worst case scenario. That’s why he believes it is better to just let things slide this time with an eye closed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_679"><span>However——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_680"><span>「I won’t look further in about your subordinate, but do include me in the meeting. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_681"><span>Fuze also suggests his own view, and says there's no negotiation with his term.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_682"><span>He probably thinks whatever is in the meeting cannot be simply ignored. You can tell from the determination in his eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_683"><span>「Alright then. But I hope you all will trust me as well. I don’t have any intention to antagonize humanity. So I won’t stop you from attending the meeting.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_684"><span>I shrug after finishing the sentence and agreed to let Fuze join the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_685"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_686"><span>Rigurdo escorts Fuze to the lounge.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_687"><span>Since Gazel’s party also wishes to join the meeting, we have to tide up the meeting hall. Because of that, I want to have Fuze rest for now as much as possible.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_688"><span>Seeing all this, Gazel questions me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_689"><span>「Huh, are you sure that man is trustworthy, Rimuru?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_690"><span>「He is, it’s all good here.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_691"><span>Fuze is indeed a trustworthy man. I answer with confidence.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_692"><span>「Hmm. If that’s the case, those people would be the only issue now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_693"><span>With that being said, Gazel gazes menacingly behind us.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_694"><span>Eh, are there people there?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_695"><span>I turn my back in surprise and discover a group of strangers in front of me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_696"><span>A gentleman in expensive clothings who is quite handsome. He must have been really popular in his prime.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_697"><span>The man has a rather unique pair of long and narrow eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_698"><span>There are five other people who look like highly ranked military general that stand by the two sides of this gentleman. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_699"><span>You can tell they have received good trainings.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_700"><span>But I didn’t even notice with them being so close….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_701"><span>How could this be, my 「Universal Perception」didn’t react at all——!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_702"><span>I’m rather panicked when this thought raises over me. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_703"><span>《Answer. There is no hostility detected from this group of people.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_704"><span>Raphael-sama rather unpleasantly informs me. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_705"><span>Ah, right, I see.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_706"><span>…….Ugh, this one is really on me. Just now I was complaining about receiving too much information.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_707"><span>In other words, my rather vague request of letting Raphael distinguish those who wish harm on me was quite unreasonable.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_708"><span>I can’t blame「<span data-term="Wisdom King Raphael" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」for being mad.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_709"><span>Sorry! In the future I hope you’ll just report everything as it is——I apologize from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_710"><span>It is rather embarrassing to apologize to my own skill, but it is the intent that matters.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_711"><span>Not noticing what I’ve been doing, Gazel continued to converse with the mysterious group.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_712"><span>「Where did you all come from?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_713"><span>「What a coincidence! Aren’t you the king that likes to hide and live underground? What a surprise. I never expected chicken like you would come in aid of a 『Demon Lord』....」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_714"><span>That man is rather at ease with his attitude even with Gazel’s imposing </span><span>haki</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="should we add in a * as to explain haki for the readers?

You idiot elven offspring who likes to stay on high ground. Have you finally decided to visit the mortal realm from the City of God tree? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_717"><span>Gazel seems to have seen through the act and hence disarmed his alert. Instead, he laughed smugly and teased the man back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_718"><span>From the looks of it, Gazel and the man knew each other.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_719"><span>So Raphael’s reaction was right in that he holds no hostility. Maybe it’s just that Gazel and the man can’t get along with each other. However, that may be too much considering the two just seem like friends who love bad-mouthing each other.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_720"><span>「Rimuru-sama, they seem to be the messengers from Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_721"><span>The one who reported to me is Souei’s subordinate Souka. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_722"><span>I heard he is responsible for leading these guests here. After that guy found out Gazel was present here too, he then decided to come and spice things up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_723"><span>「You just never change, Elalude.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_724"><span>The two both give one another an awkward look and greet each other.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_725"><span>That seems to be their special way of greeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_726"><span>「Right, so who is this young lady——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_727"><span>「Ah, nice to meet you, I am the leader of this forest, Rimuru. I look forward to our future encounter. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_728"><span>This narrow eye man——Elalude has laid his eyes on me, so I decided to greet him a bit.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_729"><span>I should have welcomed him in a more proper ceremonial way considering he’s a messenger from Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion. Despite that, I’ve got no clue about the customs and elegancy of the such a ceremony.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_730"><span>Even though I’ve become a Demon Lord, I still can’t find experts in that field.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_731"><span>I guess it’s fine, I’ll just have to find an expert to enlighten me another time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_732"><span>As I greet him, Elalude suddenly became </span><span>fidgety</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="could find a better word I think" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_733"><span>He started to shout with his eyes opened wide.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_734"><span>「So it is you! You are the Demon Lord that kidnapped my daughter! I hope you’ve prepared yourself for what’s coming!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_735"><span>As soon as he finished, he began to conjure a </span><span>Greater Explosive Flame spell</span><span>&nbsp;and starts the chanting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_736"><span>Oi oi, could you be any less reckless, mister?! </span></p><p class="line" id="line_737"><span>According to my knowledge, Special Greater Explosive Flame spell is one of the most difficult type of magic to conjure.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_738"><span>Fire is one of elemental-based magic and its spells range from Fireball all the way to Giant Magic Fireball. It becomes more difficult to control as the spell becomes more powerful. There are then more powerful spells such as Giant Magic Flame Barrier or Giant Magic Flame Storm that are very difficult to conjure. All in all, the difficulty of casting increases naturally with the power and scale of the spell.</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Sierra Note: Alright, so this is a bit complex, so I'll break it down for anyone who doesn't get it:" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_739"><span>So, let’s just analyze the name of spell casted by this Mister Elalude…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_740"><span>Special Greater Explosive Flame spell, to put it simply, is a synthesized magic spell.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_741"><span>It contains Fire spell that can burn and the Explosive spell that could blow away the target——By combining the two branches of spell, one can sublimate the two into a higher level of Explosive Flame Magic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_742"><span>Speaking of that, it happens to be the type of magic wielded by Shizu-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_743"><span>The difference is that Shizu-san relied also on the power of Ifrit. It’s quite difficult to control a spirit if you aren’t a conjuring expert such as Shizu-san. But, as long as you establish a trusting relationship with the spirit, it will help out in times of need and hence help control the power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_744"><span>So in contrast, when we talk about Special Greater Explosive Flame——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_745"><span>It is a very dangerous spell when one relies on himself to control the magic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_746"><span>Even so, this type of magic is not limited by the magic system itself, so there is a lot of freedom in its usage.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_747"><span>The casting speed, accuracy, power, scale, area of effect, duration of effect; one can freely distribute the spell’s magnitude in all of these major elements. If he chooses to pursue purely power, it would be a piece of cake for him to cause havoc on the town.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_748"><span>But of course, this also increases the risks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_749"><span>Conjuring spells require magicules, as well as sufficient concentration of mental abilities in order to gather the required amount. If the conjurer is incapable of doing that, the magic would not be cast. In addition, once the casting failed, the remained magicules could go out of control and turn the nearby area to a wasteland.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_750"><span>So it makes sense that why very few people actively practice such dangerous spells. Usually, only those who’s obtained a rank higher than a magician could use these high level spells for military purpose.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_751"><span>And you </span><span>definitely </span><span>shouldn’t cast it in a town like this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_752"><span>Yet that’s exactly what Elalude is planning to do.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_753"><span>What the hell is he doing. Acting like this out of nowhere.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_754"><span>He accused me of kidnapping his daughter, but what in the world is that suppose to mean?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_755"><span>Although I still haven’t been able to react, there isn’t much need to be nervous.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_756"><span>There is a loud tearing sound that goes </span><span>Siiiii</span><span>——</span><span>on the scene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_757"><span>What came at the same time was Elen’s </span><span>shouts</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="same as others, I think there can be a better word/phrasing " onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_758"><span>「Waiiit, Dad! What are you doing here!?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_759"><span>She came here angrily and realized the situation immediately. She then gave Elalude a chop on the head without saying a thing to him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_760"><span>Elen’s arrival finally got Elalude’s senses back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_761"><span>So, it would seem this Elalude is actually Elen’s father. He is finally settling down after he got scolded by an angry Elen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_762"><span>These type of people sure are troublesome for having such short temper. The image of a reasonable gentleman he built when he was talking to Gazel was completely toppled with his later actions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_763"><span>「Ehh——Ahaha. Sorry, someone told me my daughter has been kidnapped by a Demon Lord. So I kinda panicked just now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_764"><span>He says so while laughing out delightfully.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_765"><span>But you can’t just cast an Special Greater Explosive Flame spell on the town just like that! You are one daddy-gone-berserk.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_766"><span>「No, sir. I’ve told you the facts as they are. It was your own misunderstanding.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_767"><span>「Of course! It’s all dad’s fault!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_768"><span>A secretary-looking person corrects Elalude calmly and Elen thus continues to blame him harshly, causing him look horrible.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_769"><span>He does look rather pitiful like that but I can’t sympathize with him. It’s his own doing. I hope Elen will blame him more so he can reflect a little bit.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_770"><span>「——You still spoil your daughter like always, Elalude.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_771"><span>Gazel comments at Elalude as the situation got slightly calmer.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_772"><span>But Elalude doesn’t seem to have any regrets and argues back:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_773"><span>「I’m not spoiling her. It’s all because Elen-chan is too cute and I can’t help myself….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_774"><span>「That is the dictionary definition of spoiling……..Never mind, it won’t help even if I say anything.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_775"><span>Gazel is dumbfounded. It seems that’s how Elalude acted before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_776"><span>There’s probably no cure for him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_777"><span>Seeing that Gazel and Elalude have finished their conversation, Elen decided to slip in and greet Gazel.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_778"><span>「Long time no see, King Gazel.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_779"><span>Elen said as such. She seems to give off the attitude of a noble despite her adventurer outfit.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_780"><span>「Is it really Elen-chan? I didn’t recognize you at first. Hope you are doing fine. It’s really been a long time, you’ve become prettier.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_781"><span>Gazel greeted back, then Elalude starts to get all noisy and complains: 「Are you a pedophile? You better watch your back, Gazel!」Thankfully, Elen immediately gave him a savage chop on the head, accompanied by the secretary-looking guy shutting his mouth up with hand in order to prevent him from further bad mouthing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_782"><span>Gazel seemed rather used to it and simply shrugged it off without any comment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_783"><span>This guy seems to get very heated in the head whenever the topic was related to Elen. He usually acts gentle and cultured, but has a large dichotomy at times. I’ll note that for precaution.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_784"><span>「Rimuru-san, this here is my father, Duke of Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion, Elalude Grimwald.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_785"><span>「Leader of Jura Great Forest, ruler of </span><span>monster</span><span>, my daughter Elen has introduced us. My name is Elalude Grimwald. Please call me Elalude.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_786"><span>After that, Elen introduced her father Elalude to me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_787"><span>I didn’t expect this man to be the head of the Sarion Duke’s family. It seems the messenger from Sarion is not an insignificant man. I’ve heard rumors that he is a relative of the Emperor, and is in fact, the emperor’s uncle. No wonder he got to chat with Gazel so casually, since he is indeed qualified. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_788"><span>To be perfectly clear, he is one of the top three most powerful persons in the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_789"><span>That gave me quite the shock.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_790"><span>If that’s the case——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_791"><span>T-then Elen would be a super prominent daughter of a noble.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_792"><span>I’ve heard of her noble origin, but such prominent origin is really something else….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_793"><span>It won’t be too much to address her as Mademoiselle</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Japanese word is お嬢様 (Ojousama), the daughter of a rich/influential individual/family. The address is often used by servants to said individual. " onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>. A noble with such prominence deciding to become an adventurer… she may have been too liberal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_794"><span>I shouldn't be the only one thinking so, but she doesn’t seem to mind at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_795"><span>Perhaps there are people secretly protecting her. She seemed to already know when she told me about the Demon Lord awakening that her leaking that information would have been exposed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_796"><span>Cabal and Kido, these two followers must have a hard time accompanying her. I have to find a chance to compensate them…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_797"><span>But, right now——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_798"><span>&nbsp;「So, did you come here just for Elen-san?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_799"><span>It’s probably not that simple.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_800"><span>I thought to myself and looked towards Elalude.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_801"><span>「Hehehe, of course not. I came here to discuss diplomatic relations with your country, as well as to confirm things with my own eyes. To check out who the mythical Slime really is and why my daughter took such a liking to you. It’s quite unbelievable to witness your menacing aura as a leader despite the fact that you are actually a slime. But still, I wanted to test your ability. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_802"><span>Elalude gives off an evil smile after saying so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_803"><span>That’s why he casted that spell, to intentionally test us as it would seem.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_804"><span>Benimaru, Shuna and Shion are all on hold next to me. My officers all did not fringe while facing off the danger. But that is only natural as they’ve all predicted that he won’t cast the spell. They’ve grown a lot since they would likely have lost their temper if it was the old them. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_805"><span>「I’ve analyzed the spell you were going to cast, but it was obvious that your magicule count did not meet the basic requirement.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_806"><span>Shuna says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_807"><span>It seems his bluff has been seen through, Elalude also throws a wry smile to tease.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_808"><span>「My my, now I’ve been exposed of my incompetency.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_809"><span>「No, it’s really something how you’ve controlled the speed of your casting to mislead others in believing the magic is going to be casted. It’s very admirable how you are able to utilize that homunculus body of yours so thoroughly. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_810"><span>Seeing Elalude mocking himself, Shuna responds gently. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_811"><span>「Oh? That’s surprising. Have you found out that this body is artificial?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_812"><span>「Yes. It would seem you’ve inserted your astral body into it. The famous technology of the Sorcerer Dynasty Sarion surely lives up to its fame as the nation with endeavour of magic. Very impressive.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_813"><span>Hearing Shuna’s wods, I also try to run an 「Appraisal」. Indeed, out of the entire group, only Elalude is using a homunculus body. It would seem that it is part of the effort to protect such a famous noble.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_814"><span>That’s why I thought he didn’t bring enough guards when he came to meet someone who claims to be Demon Lord. If I think that way, dwarf king Gazel is the exception.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_815"><span>But anyway, the homunculus is so skillfully crafted that it looks realistic enough to be indistinguishable from real people.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_816"><span>Once we’ve settled our business here, I need to ask him to teach me the techniques.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_817"><span>Elalude mentioned that his intent is to assess the diplomacy between our countries. But that doesn’t seem to be the only thing on his mind. I suppose we will figure out later, there’s no need to rush out for an answer.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_818"><span>Perhaps I should invite Elalude to the meeting as well for him to make further judgements.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_819"><span>I also wish to hear what’s his opinion on the future policies our country may adapt, it will be a great opportunity. But it depends on the result of the meeting. It is possible that even Sarion may become hostile to us. However, if things really go down that path, I’ll have to deal with it then.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_820"><span>Gobuta came to inform us that the preparations for the meeting are completed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_821"><span>I was planning to discuss things with my own subordinates but I don’t seem to have the opportunity right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_822"><span>Not only so, we are heading straight to the official meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_823"><span>I was planning to prepare information on the countries beforehand to better inquire them. That’s how a diplomat would often do to engage first, observe each others’ interests and conflicts so as to reach a common ground.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_824"><span>Since we’ve not done any rehearsal beforehand, everyone will just have to express their genuine views.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_825"><span>Our future would be dependent on this meeting. If we fail to reach an agreement, it is no exaggeration that it will lead to war.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_826"><span>I boost my own spirit and head towards the meeting room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_827"><span>As such, the essential meeting that would decide the future of the Jura-Tempest Federation now begins.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_828"><span>——This meeting would be bestowed with a legendary status, and historically known as the Meeting between Human and </span><span>Monster</span><span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_829"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_830"><span>I enter the meeting room and see everyone standing, awaiting my arrival.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_831"><span>There are the three Beastketeers, Fuze, King Gazel and Duke Elalude. The VIPs of each country are directed to their special seats and are seated.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_832"><span>After they sat, I walked towards the most inner seat &nbsp;while everyone sat down rather unanimously. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_833"><span>The meeting is commenced in a solemn environment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_834"><span>First off, we need to introduce all the participants of the meeting. After all, there are many members here who came from strong nations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_835"><span>Some of us know them, but in order to avoid any disrespect, it’s best to introduce everyone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_836"><span>As such, we begin to introduce the guests</span></p><p class="line" id="line_837"><span>「Well then, we shall introduce the guests.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_838"><span>Following my look, Shuna understood my order and begins to announce the names.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_839"><span>Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_840"><span>The spokespersons consisted of the three Beastketeers who represent the Beast King’s army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_841"><span>Thinking about it, Phobio and <span data-term="Suphia" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are rather——let’s just say——single-minded.

So I’d better factor that in to accommodate his op.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_846"><span>He’s may be doing me a lot of favor this time as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_847"><span>Kingdom of <span data-term="Brumund" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_848"><span>Unfortunately, this nation did not send an official representative. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_849"><span>Since Fuze is the head of the Freedom Association Branch in <span data-term="Brumund" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, plus he’s closely related to Baron Bayette who is a minister of <span data-term="Brumund" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom, he should have the same rank of authority to him. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_850"><span>He’s undoubtedly the best representative they can choose. I should really listen to his precious opinions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_851"><span>The next one is Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_852"><span>They suddenly came to participate, yet the head of the group is the famous noble Duke Elalude.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_853"><span>Elalude is the dumb father who spoils his daughter, but who nonetheless possesses the cruel outlook of a noble.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_854"><span>The goal of their trip is to assess my country. He probably wouldn’t make any misjudgement and do anything stupid due to the love he has for his daughter .</span></p><p class="line" id="line_855"><span>That guy is something else, and I definitely can’t overlook him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_856"><span>Apart from that…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_857"><span>Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion has the national power to stand against the council states by itself, and it’s a superpower rivalling the Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_858"><span>If everything goes smoothly, we may even get to forge an alliance with them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_859"><span>One shouldn’t be too greedy, that’s how the saying goes. That’s why I need to treat it carefully.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_860"><span>Glancing at the surrounding guests, everyone is a prominent character.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_861"><span>If it is only me that is holding the meeting, I may not be able to think sufficiently objectively. Considering that point, it is truly lucky for me to have the human members participating in the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_862"><span>What follows is the introduction of the members of the M</span><span>onster</span><span>&nbsp;Nation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_863"><span>These are some familiar figures, but I should still do an introduction for the officers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_864"><span>I look at Rigurdo and the Goblin elders. Nowadays, they all look the part with luxurious clothings that can compete against any other nations’ representative.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_865"><span>They even look more imposed than me, it makes me feel like I’m able to depend on them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_866"><span>The ministers of different department greets everyone. The moderator of the forest, Dryad Treyni-san, also came to greet them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_867"><span>Elalude looks rather surprised at the presence of the highest ranking species to show up here, but he still pretends to be calm and greets back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_868"><span>Gazel’s initial reaction to the scene was also interesting, they were all quite surprised by that before. Anyway, I shouldn’t be going around and exposing them like this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_869"><span>At last I introduce the relevant personell from the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_870"><span>Especially <span data-term="Youmu" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party, alongside <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span data-term="Grucius" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_871"><span>I was planning to let these people to build up a new nation there.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_872"><span>However, I don’t know whether they will accept if I raise the proposals during the meeting...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_873"><span>This proposal may be the determining factor to the success of the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_874"><span>I nod to notify Shion and Diablo who were waiting for orders behind me. Thus, I was able to roughly conclude the round of self-introduction from our side.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_875"><span>Oh, right, I almost forgot.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_876"><span>「Shuna, what’s the progress on Veldora’s clothes?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_877"><span>「Yes, Veldora-sama is——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_878"><span>Shuna couldn’t even finish before the delightful laughter of 「GA——HAHAHA」arrives. I was worried that his original outfit would seem unfit for such occasion so I requested Shuna to help him make a random set of clothings. It would seem I was able to catch up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_879"><span>As the meeting room door is opened, Veldora enters the meeting room as if he’s visiting a tourist place. I rise up to introduce Veldora and direct him to rest of the participants.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_880"><span>I hope this one can go smoothly, I pray to myself——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_881"><span>「Allow me to introduce him to my fellow guests. Some of you may have heard of his name, so please remain calm——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_882"><span>I decide to make a forecast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_883"><span>My subordinates are all now aware of his identity, and they all looks nervous while gulping in tension. The legendary evil dragon is right before them, and even they are afraid.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_884"><span>I found that the atmosphere has changed, there was a sudden silence at the scene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_885"><span>And next——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_886"><span>「This is my ally Veldora.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_887"><span>「I’m Veldora! Some people seem to call me「Storm Dragon」. Hmm, not a lot of people get to talk to me in equal term so count yourselves lucky. And you should feel honored!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_888"><span>As soon as I called his name, Veldora immediately proceeded with this introduction. He’s still arrogant as always, but it does suit him</span></p><p class="line" id="line_889"><span>I thought I told him to stay quietly during the meeting… He probably got bored immediately and came to stir things up…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_890"><span>「I hope you can act as the consultant of our meeting today. I’ll be happy if you just stand aside and play nice. So could you leave now?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_891"><span>「Gahahaha, Rimuru, you are so ruthless! Stop bullying me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_892"><span>「Listen now, we are talking business here, so could you stop causing a scene here, okay? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_893"><span>「Trust me! How could I cause a scene now?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_894"><span>Veldora gave me his word, so I’ll have to comply… If that doesn’t work I’ll then give him his bible (manga). I must prevent him from giving me any trouble.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_895"><span>Up until now, the room is completely silent.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_896"><span>Everyone is frozen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_897"><span>And…..Eh?!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_898"><span>“</span><span>Pong-dong</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="is there not a better phrase?

I need to talk to you NOW, Rimuru!」 </span></p><p class="line" id="line_899"><span>Rigurdo and the rest decide to start kneeling and bowing their heads like last time——The situation has gone wild beyond repair.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_900"><span>You could figure out why the meeting has been interrupted with your knees.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_901"><span>……...Or rather, the meeting hasn’t even started yet.

It’s armageddon in here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_905"><span>Veldora sure is a mean character.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_906"><span>People are are truly afraid of this「Storm Dragon」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_907"><span>Well, that is to be expected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_908"><span>The sudden appearance of the Catastrophe rank </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;would undoubtedly cause such a commotion. To the world, he is more horrifying than Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_909"><span>Thankfully, not everyone thinks that way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_910"><span>Since there will inevitably be chaos, it’s best if I just introduce him to everyone first.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_911"><span>It would seem I need to take Veldora into consideration for my future planning.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_912"><span>The guests from each nations looks ill with their strength all gone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_913"><span>Even though Veldora has already suppressed his aura, it may still have affected the crowds.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_914"><span>My companions such as Benimaru or Shion would usually contain their aura, while the weaker </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;and humans who visit this town have also gotten used to it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_915"><span>The new addition to the crew, Diablo, has the ability to suppress his aura even better than me. He is very talented in that aspect and should be considered as a model for everyone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_916"><span>The issue lies with Veldora, who is supposed to have special training session with me to learn about the techniques to control his aura.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_917"><span>But he said in all confidence that this was nothing. I think it’s likely due to his evolved Ultimate Skill 「<span data-term="Investigation King Faust" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_918"><span>So I thought everything would be fine….. was I being too naive?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_919"><span>After all, his aura was still leaking out even with the seal applied, preventing </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;below Rank B from approaching.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_920"><span>To be safe, I tried to use 「Appraisal」 to determine the magicules in the room, but I found nothing out of place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_921"><span>If that’s the case, the reason would be——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_922"><span>「Rimuru, I’ve got something to talk to you about. Let’s pause the meeting and so I can borrow some of your time.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_923"><span>Gazel pats my shoulder and proposes, with a charming smile on his face.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_924"><span>He was just shouting … he must be really serious. My instinct tells me to not resist him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_925"><span>I tell everyone that the meeting would be put on hold for a moment and start to move out from my seat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_926"><span>No one seems to object.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_927"><span>It’s no wonder, since someone has already fainted.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_928"><span>After leaving the rest of the matters to the others, we head towards the reception room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_929"><span>I followed Gazel’s order to get Veldora away from the rest of the meeting so that shouldn’t be an issue any longer.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_930"><span>Including the three Beastketeers, a lot of people wish to learn about Veldora’s current status. That may buy us some time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_931"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;………………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_932"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_933"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p><p class="line" id="line_934"><span>The ones entered in the room are Gazel and Elalude.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_935"><span>I requested that Shuna go make tea for the rest of the people at the meeting and told Benimaru and Shion to take care of the meeting room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_936"><span>「Just to be clear, her majesty the Emperor has granted me full authority on this issue. So I will speak of my stance in the name of the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion. Now that you are informed of that, please explain the situation. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_937"><span>Elalude is the first to talk.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_938"><span>He is no longer a dumb father at the moment, but a politician, the prominent nobleman of Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_939"><span>He is very imposing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_940"><span>Does Sarion want to sit and watch quietly how this event unfolds?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_941"><span>They don’t seem to hold any hostility, and by what he proposed, they would be observing my every move before determining their relationship with our country.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_942"><span>But Elalude would probably still need to clean up the mess that Elen did...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_943"><span>At least I know they are not enemies, so it shouldn’t be a problem to look to them for help.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_944"><span>「I understand. Then I’ll swear to tell you the whole truth.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_945"><span>Since the other side has laid out their cards, I also need to be more serious about the issue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_946"><span>With our agreement made, a secret meeting is thus unfolded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_947"><span>Let’s hear what Gazel has to say first.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_948"><span>「Alright, what do you wish to talk about?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_949"><span>「Spare me the act. What the hell is it with the revival of the 『Storm Dragon』?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_950"><span>Even man like Gazel couldn’t conceal his surprise. His shout sounds rather agitated.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_951"><span>It’s a rare sight for someone as calm as Gazel. He must have really been shocked.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_952"><span>I could have figured out a way to play dumb, but it would be meaningless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_953"><span>So I decide to roughly explain the entire story.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_954"><span>With that being said however, I only mentioned about meeting Veldora in the cave and assisting him in breaking the seal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_955"><span>As soon as I finished the short account, Gazel begins to have headache and starts to groan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_956"><span>「I could not have anticipated things to turn out like this. It’s already a mess now that you’ve become a Demon Lord, but you’ve made an even bigger mess…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_957"><span>Ehh, no need to praise me like that</span><span>——I wanted to say that to ease the mood but chose not to. It may be my misjudgement but I think it would piss Gazel off.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_958"><span>「So, Rimuru-dono. That lord is really——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_959"><span>Since Elalude asked, I nod towards him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_960"><span>Veldora could actually properly conceal his aura like that, which is rather hard for him to believe in such short time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_961"><span>「——I suppose it’s true, it must have been the real deal. No man or </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;would be stupid enough to try and &nbsp;fool people with the name of that evil dragon.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_962"><span>It actually makes a lot of sense with how he phrases it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_963"><span>That’s probably why Elen and Fuze believed the case immediately after hearing it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_964"><span>Not only </span><span>monster</span><span>, who are aware of the importance of names, but even humans know they stand to gain no benefit by pretending to be the evil dragon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_965"><span>Essentially, Gazel has not doubted his identity from the start. I asked him why afterward and only got the response that 「I couldn’t see him through.」. In other words, Gazel has indirectly admitted that he can read minds. That’s really impressive! But that really isn’t the focus of the issue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_966"><span>「But, what should we do….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_967"><span>「Right, I’m already in a terrible spot trying to clean up the mess left by my daughter….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_968"><span>Gazel and Elalude look at each other.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_969"><span>The two seem to be unable to get along, but they are probably very close friends.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_970"><span>「The real issue would be whether to go public with this, or to conceal it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_971"><span>「It should be fine to do so in the western nations. As for Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion, I’ll just tell the Emperor what I’ve heard. The problem is——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_972"><span>「It’s Western Saints Church, right? You can never fool them. Among all the 『True Dragons:』, the Church hates the 『Storm Dragon』 the most. They would definitely be on to him as soon as he had been revived.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_973"><span>「If we are to hide the truth, we have to act together as if we have no clue. But that likely won’t work and render us all 『Nemesis of God』.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_974"><span>Just like that, the two exchanged their opinions and attempted to figure a solution for my situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_975"><span>What about me? My job is simple. I just need to nod and say “Hmm hmm” to them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_976"><span>「Are you even listening, Rimuru?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_977"><span>「Yeah, your problem is causing us two headaches. If you don’t take it seriously, we would really be troubled!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_978"><span>Eh, I got scolded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_979"><span>I suppose I should give in and reflect, and then talk about my own views.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_980"><span>「Since there is no way we can keep hiding about Veldora, I’ve planned to make it public. There’s no way around Western Saints Church but whatever, so we would eventually need find a solution.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_981"><span>「Hmm, since you’ve decided, I have no objection.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_982"><span>Gazal agreed without any argument.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_983"><span>「A alliance between Demon Lord and True Dragon is no joking matter. Honestly, the problem at hand is surprisingly difficult to deal with. But on second thought, I’m lucky to be here. Since right now I get to participate in this meeting and was fortunate enough to gain such useful information to determine my nation’s stance——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_984"><span>Elalude smirks and expresses his view from a powerful nation’s point of view. That is——If both the Disaster-Rank Demon Lord and the Catastrophe-Rank True Dragon somehow coexists in the same nation, it would be foolish to try and mess with them. Gazel agrees to his view as he nods heavily.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_985"><span>In terms of scale, Tempest Federation is far from more powerful nations such as Dwargon and Sarion. But if it’s only in terms of military, not only would these two nations be on the same playfield as ours, they may even be unable to surpass us. They say so because this has been acknowledged by both Gazel and Elalude in private.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_986"><span>「If according to your words, you will both stand on the same frontline with us if we become an enemy with the Western Saints Church, am I on the right track?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_987"><span>As soon as I ask, Gazel replies dismally:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_988"><span>「Do you have to ask this? Rimuru, you’ve got to practice on how to maintain your composure——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_989"><span>Then he shows an annoyed look and says 「Thank god this is a private meeting….」and begins to explain to me in details.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_990"><span>They both have no need to antagonize my nation but at the same time, they can’t let their own nations be in danger. Plus, they won’t be responsible for dealing with the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_991"><span>Gazel promises that he will maintain a neutral relationship while forging a diplomatic tie.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_992"><span>As such, there’s only Elalude left…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_993"><span>We basically don’t even have any diplomatic tie with Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion. Even under such condition, this man still decide to greatly back us up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_994"><span>「I’ll be reassured with Gazel’s help. And speaking of which, Elalude-san——sama, why have you been so proactive…..?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_995"><span>As I ask, Elalude responds with an annoyed look and answers:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_996"><span>「——There’s no need for “san” or “sama” when you talk to me. But Rimuru-dono, please remember to refer to others with their appropriate titles and occupations in public. You are, after all, a king, so you shouldn’t act all groveling towards foreign guests in public. If you wished to be vassalized (bring into a condition of subordination), that would be a different matter. Anyhow, allow me to answer your question—— 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_997"><span>He gave me a special instruction in fear of me embarrassing myself, I suppose he has a empathetic side too.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_998"><span>This thought made me express my appreciation, before I find Elalude is staring at me with long sighs. Then he switches up his mood and explain his reasons.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_999"><span>It all started with his daughter Elen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1000"><span>It was rumored that Elen has been held responsible due to her sharing of the Demon Lord awakening information to me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1001"><span>In other words, she was an accomplice in catalysing the birth of a new Demon Lord. That’s why there is no way the nation would leave it like this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1002"><span>But, Grand Duke Elalude was able to show his ways during this time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1003"><span>He was able to cover up the inquisition and made it so that the emperor was the only one aware of the situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1004"><span>Afterward he spent the time predicting his future moves and wait for the right opportunity to strike.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1005"><span>Magical surveillance seems to be a difficult task to execute, yet through it, Elalude was able to find out about my evolution to Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1006"><span>He can just pretend he knows nothing had I not become one, but there would be no way around but to intervene if the transformation was successful. When he came to visit me, he has already planned for the worst and recognized there may even be a need to dispatch invasive forces.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1007"><span>「Based on all these reasons, I went out myself in hope of less people finding out about this.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1008"><span>Elalude concludes like that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1009"><span>In other words, if he was to confirms I am an evil individual, he would destroy everything as soon as possible to cover up the truth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1010"><span>「Then, what would be your judgement?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1011"><span>「As I’ve said, I don’t plan to become your enemy, rather we should build up a friendly relationship.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1012"><span>I see, he has accepted me. I’m quite happy that I’ve been judged as someone who’s not evil.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1013"><span>「Hmm, that would be the natural choice.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1014"><span>「Of course. Our country practices freedom of religion, which includes more than just the Ruminas sect. Rather dying for one religion, I’d put our national interests in the priority.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1015"><span>「Huh. I thought that I couldn’t see you eye to eye, but somehow we’ve reached some common ground now. Elalude, my nation is also not in line with the ideology of Western Saints Church. I’ve planned to support building ties with the Tempest Federation from the start.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1016"><span>Upon saying so, Gazel and Elalude smiles at each other.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1017"><span>「No, there are still too many questions left. Regarding the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army eliminated by Rimuru-dono, even if we spread out the claim that they’ve all died from the war, the death count is still too high. And with just that point, my daughter has suggested——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1018"><span>Elalude looks rather confused while saying so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1019"><span>Could this be his real intent?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1020"><span>It wasn’t the focus whether I am evil or not, he is afraid of the real casualty numbers of the war being spread in the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1021"><span>There is no way anyone would think otherwise that a Demon Lord who murdered twenty-thousand people is not evil. The Western Saints Church definitely would have a more justified testimony, and I would be treated as a「Nemesis of God」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1022"><span>Right, having diplomatic tie with such an evil person——me, would indeed implicate badly on these nations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1023"><span>What to do then? Ehh——I began to worry.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1024"><span>Just as I was thinking, Gazel gives off a grin and says:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1025"><span>「Don’t worry, I’ve got a solution.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1026"><span>Ah, no way!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1027"><span>If according to what Gazel just said, the king of <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suddenly vanished from the world!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1028"><span>「All of the corpses have disappeared without trace. Wouldn't they suspect that there was no survivor?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1029"><span>「If that’s the case, then you get to alter the story however you want」—Gazel smiles and respond.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1030"><span>——The truth matters very little to the people and the other countries. As long as the story is pleasant to the ear, it would suffice the crowds.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1031"><span>「Oh——That is a wonderful idea. Gazel, surely you would want me to co-write the script with you, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1032"><span>Elalude also switches to his politician eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1033"><span>They probably arrange narrative in their interests to maintain their innocence. For Elalude it is probably for both national interest and for Elen…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1034"><span>Then I should make my resolve as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1035"><span>After all, I decided to save everyone at the cost of massacring twenty-thousand people. My faith won’t shake even if I had to bear more sin than that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1036"><span>「It seems you’ve decided to walk the grey area, Rimuru. That’s right, that’s how it should be. It’s not easy being a king. &nbsp;」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1037"><span>There’s no use regretting things now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1038"><span>It is a necessary process.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1039"><span>「I’ve long made up my mind. Then, how do you plan to explain to the world, Gazel?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1040"><span>「Hehe, let’s see now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1041"><span>Gazel’s gaze became a bit more gentle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1042"><span>Afterward we spent an hour to discuss and layout the plan carefully.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1043"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; ………………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1044"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1045"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; ………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1046"><span>When we returned to the meeting room, peace has been restored.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1047"><span>They were finally able to get back to the peaceful atmosphere before and took care of the ones fainted.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1048"><span>The unexpected reaction plunged the meeting in chaos, but it really couldn’t be helped.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1049"><span>Let’s just let the past stay in the past and focus on dealing with the future. Thankfully I was able to discuss a solution with Gazel and Elalude. Now that I think back carefully, that period of time was really precious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1050"><span>Fuze, Elen and some others are still exhausted and collapsed in the chair.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1051"><span>「Are you guys alright? How do you feel now?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1052"><span>I ask out of care. But instead they all look at me with resentment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1053"><span>「...........Even I’ve not heard of it. Such an IMPORTANT THING——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1054"><span>「Are you kidding me, you big meanie! You even kept me out of the scene….. His name is Veldora….-san? And he is your good friend?! Have you even mentioned that to me?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1055"><span>And all sorts of complaint flew straight at me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1056"><span>Would it really help by complaining about it to me?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1057"><span>He’s been swallowed by me into my「Stomach」——How could I even say something like that. Plus, would anyone even believe that?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1058"><span>「Ehh? I didn’t mention? Did I now……? Never mind, let’s just forget about the past, pretty please (〃´∀｀)? There’s more important things to do, so let’s have a meeting now! (´∀`)」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1059"><span>I responded with a delightful smile, but it obviously didn’t work.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1060"><span>「「「DON’T PLAY DUMB——!!!」」」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1061"><span>They all shouted at me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1062"><span>「Ha….hahaha~ yes-yes——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1063"><span>I try to calm everyone day with a laugh.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1064"><span>It’s really because these people are too carefree. After all, they didn’t change their attitudes at all, even after I became a Demon Lord...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1065"><span>I don’t mind them being so casual to me, and I’m even happy for that……..But I do hope they can be more polite——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1066"><span>「Are you even listening? Gosh, I hope you would genuinely reflect yourself!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1067"><span>「Please stop doing this, master.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1068"><span>「That’s right, I’m getting heart failure from it…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1069"><span>But they don’t seem to follow basic courtesy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1070"><span>But that’s how Elen and her party act.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1071"><span>Fuze is also the same.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1072"><span>「Ah, but——I need to report this to my superior….. Eh, but I am the head of the branch!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1073"><span>That’s how he acts, always so carefree. He has accepted the reality of the situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1074"><span>His reaction before of fearing Veldora seems to be fake. &nbsp;But if I hadn’t told him to visit the restroom, he would probably have already pissed himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1075"><span>Nice save! I pat his shoulder and got stared at &nbsp;instead.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1076"><span>「You now, don’t act like it’s none of your business…...I’m gonna have to report this to my superior first. I’ll come back later to take the compensation for my mental damage. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1077"><span>My advice saved him and I’d expected him to thank me. But somehow he argued back and scolded me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1078"><span>Never mind, I will be the bigger man here. I was joking with him anyway. And Fuze got back on his normal feet quick enough.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1079"><span>——That’s how everyone accepted Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1080"><span>It is an hour later by the time the meeting restart</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1081"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1082"><span>Now the meeting can be officially commenced.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1083"><span>We will discuss Clayman’s declaration of war later.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1084"><span>Souei has briefed me on this and he hasn’t been able to find their base yet. I, on the other hand, was more concerned about whether Clayman was on the move. So I had Souei keep an eye on that as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1085"><span>Since you can’t exactly rush this, I’ve decided to finish the meeting with the heads of each nation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1086"><span>Although it’s rather troublesome, let us revisit the story once more.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1087"><span>There were many things that took place in between, so I decided to spare everyone the details. In order to get everyone on the same page, I started to explain the situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1088"><span>It started from my encounter with Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1089"><span>I also told them my identity as a 「Otherworlder」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1090"><span>Since there’s no need to keeping hiding it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1091"><span>Since all of my subordinates know of my story, it would make little difference to inform Gazel and Elalude. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_1092"><span>So what that a Demon Lord was once a 「Otherworlder」? Demon Lord Leon was also a 「Otherworlder」......</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1093"><span>I also briefly explained my battle against the Orc Lord as well the construction of the town here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1094"><span>It is very important to share the information with others.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1095"><span>Given their interpretation from a different point of view, they may have a different reaction than mine.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1096"><span>There were more things that happened after the construction of the town..... And I proceeded to talk about my journey to Ingracia Kingdom to fulfill </span><span>Shizu</span><span>-san</span><span>’s</span><span>&nbsp;will.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1097"><span>I did skip the details of the life at the town and Yuuki’s request, but I also mentioned about my duel with Hinata</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1098"><span>She was really strong.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1099"><span>If her opponent wouldn't've been me, they would have been killed already.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1100"><span>Not even Benimaru plus Souei would survive that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1101"><span>She may have been as strong as Hakurou, perhaps even stronger. She was also able to cast many unknown magics.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1102"><span>Especially 「Holy Purification Barrier」, that one is extremely dangerous.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1103"><span>There may even be a mini-scale one for battle against single enemy. I share my memories and knowledge to everyone using 「Telepathy Net」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1104"><span>Although I’m unsure whether we would be able to deal with it, we are better off knowing our opponents’ abilities when we encounter them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1105"><span>I need to try my best to let everyone realize how terrifying Hinata really is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1106"><span>At least it will give them a better chance to escape.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1107"><span>「Hinata Sakaguchi, right? That woman does look very cruel and gives off the impression of a ruthless murderer. But according to our intel, the reality does not check out. For instance, she will give aid to whoever seek help from her as well as those who are willing to accept her aid. But if the people are not willing to listen to her, she would just stop helping. A very rational woman—— 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1108"><span>Does Fuze secretly know Hinata? He’s been defending her all the time during my explanation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1109"><span>I don’t want to be hostile against Hinata either, but she simply won’t listen to me…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1110"><span>It does sound like something she would do to exclude those who refuses to listen to her from the aid list.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1111"><span>After all there are probably a lot of people seeking refuge, you can’t blame her for letting go of those idiots.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1112"><span>A true rationalist.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1113"><span>Yuuki did mention that Hinata is a realist, so Fuze’s report was not wrong.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1114"><span>With that said, Fuze’s source is surprisingly accurate.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1115"><span>Gazel also nods along as my thought continues to this point.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1116"><span>「Hmm, as expected of the Brunmund branch head, you are good at manipulating the information network. The precision of the intelligences you’ve collected can match up against those obtained by our nation's’ secret service. I can vouch for the accuracy of the intelligences. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1117"><span>Gazel speaks as if he’s playing along with Fuze.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1118"><span>But Hinata won’t even hear my explanation…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1119"><span>「But that woman won’t even give me a chance to explain.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1120"><span>Indeed, she has treated me as an eyesore from the start. But it seemed that she had been fed with the wrong information, but the part of not listening to reason is just…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1121"><span>「Well, that may be because of the doctrine of Ruminas sect “No negotiation with </span><span>monster</span><span>s”.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1122"><span>Elaldu surprisingly answered my confusion. Hinata seems to be rather famous even in Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion. You can tell then her reputation is widely spread, which surprises me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1123"><span>——No, perhaps it is the natural things from a nation’s perspective to gather intelligence on the strongest knight in the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1124"><span>Maybe she became a celebrity because of her beauty——Such a though flew over me a couple of times, but I should probably not say it out loud.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1125"><span>After hearing the explanation by Fuze and the rest, I now begin to understand who Hinata really is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1126"><span>She is known for her cruelty in actions and words, and it’s said to have never broken the doctrines of her religion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1127"><span>She is the most ideal model for the Knights.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1128"><span>In other words, Hinata is the guardian of law and order.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1129"><span>But if that’s the case, why hasn’t she stopped the summoning ritual by all the nations?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1130"><span>It’s a simple summoning ritual and would usually summon children. No matter how you look at it, these all seem to be reckless actions of individual countries.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1131"><span>「Regarding that, there is no way we could know whether she has interfered with the summoning ritual of the nations, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1132"><span>Fuze speaks up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1133"><span>I suppose that’s right as well….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1134"><span>「The summoning magic that would bring 『Otherworlder』 are not knowledge to the public and are secret techniques strictly prohibited by the laws of the Western Council States. So, these nations won’t easily admit their actions. No investigation can be led as long as they insist they’ve not used the summoinig magic. The Western Saints Church may have access to a wide range of authorities, but they can’t interfere with domestic policies. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1135"><span>For instance, the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom has been using 「Otherworlder」 as weapons. They would probably argue that these are just 「Otherworlder」 they discovered and took in by chance in order to avoid regulations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1136"><span>In this way, there’s indeed no definitive evidence to support any claims. The Western Saints Church wouldn’t be able to intervene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1137"><span>If that’s true, it would be unfair to blame Hinata for not being more proactive on the issue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1138"><span>Right, Yuuki also said something else about her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1139"><span>——He said 「I can’t figure her out.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1140"><span>Perhaps Hinata has acted in her own way in order to stop the summoning rituals.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1141"><span>Even if it is, it won’t solve anything by worrying myself with this any longer.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1142"><span>「Anyway, Hinata is probably gonna be hard to deal with. If she is willing to listen, I may find a chance to talk to her and resolve our misunderstanding......」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1143"><span>But if the Western Saints Church consider us the 「Nemesis of God」, our confrontation with Hinata would then be inevitable.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1144"><span>I wouldn’t want to fight her if possible, but we’ll see how things develop.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1145"><span>「Kufufufufu. Should I personally set out to end her life for you? Shouldn't we get rid of the dangerous individuals to prevent further grievances?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1146"><span>Hearing my own mumblings, Diablo, who’s been waiting for order behind me, makes such proposal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1147"><span>This guy is surprisingly confident. He’s a newbie, so he seems to be very eager towards every possible opportunity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1148"><span>「Oi oi, even I lost to Hinata——no, even I fought to a draw with her! How could you be so confident in handling her?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1149"><span>Seriously, please go through your brain before you speak, okay?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1150"><span>「That’s right, Diablo. Instead of sending cheap shot like you, I shall go kill that woman. So Rimuru-sama, please give me the order now! 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1151"><span>You see. Now Diablo’s nonsense has drawn out Shion as well!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1152"><span>「Ho ho, so it’s Shion-san. I am grateful that you’ve taught me the techniques of being a secretary so I’ll put it lightly….. It’s a shame that you are no match for Hinata. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1153"><span>「Oh? So according to what you just said, do you think you are stronger than me? Interesting, how about we find out about that right here right now——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1154"><span>「SILENCE!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1155"><span>I shout out to stop the sudden confrontation between Diablo and Shion.</span></p><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image21.png" title="" height="828" width="553" class="line" id="line_1156"><p class="line" id="line_1157"><span>I didn’t expect him to be so aggressive despite his calm look.

I’ll say this again, I don’t want to antagonize the Western Saints Church.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1161"><span>Having been excited by the two, Veldora who’s been sitting next to me suddenly decides to stand up. I give off a long sigh after stopping him immediately after.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1162"><span>Horrible, these three are all maladjusted children.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1163"><span>No no no, everyone still has space to grow. I just have to focus on educating them in the future.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1164"><span>Now that I think about it carefully, Benimaru and Souei are a lot more composed.

Gabiru could get cocky at times, but he has learned to watch the mood, so it’s a lot of weight off my shoulders.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1165"><span>Ranga instead is still staying quietly as a listener in my shadow, and he’s more lovable than the rest of the crew.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1166"><span>The problem lies on these three, Shion, Diablo and Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1167"><span>The situation is always dangerous with these three around. I feel like I’m getting more and more mental stress.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1168"><span>I’ve got to be more cautious dealing with them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1169"><span>「Anyhow, the topic regarding Hinata and the Western Saints Church ends here. We’ll see how they react and act based on that. Since this may lead to a war, we will have to observe carefully every step.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1170"><span>I proclaim so and concluded the whole thing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1171"><span>However, there’s one more thing I shouldn’t forget. There are people secretly maneuvering behind the scene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1172"><span>Hinata knew of me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1173"><span>She said someone snitched to her, but luckily I can count on two hands the people who knew about me killing Shizu-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1174"><span>It won’t be easy to find the culprit, but the ones who know me are the most suspicious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1175"><span>There is the trio of <span data-term="Cabal" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Elen and Kido, alongside Fuze and a couple more people from <span data-term="Brumund" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom.

As a Demon Lord, how do you plan to use your power?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1491"><span>Eh, so it is about this after all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1492"><span>Simple question.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1493"><span>I wish to create a new world according to my heart and allow everyone to have a meaningful life.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1494"><span>If I could, I wish to create a prosperous world where people’s days are filled with joyful laughter.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1495"><span>I truly hope so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1496"><span>I express my true feeling to Elalude without hesitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1497"><span>「——That’s about it. But, no way things would always be so smooth-sailing, facing failure would be inevitable.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1498"><span>「Th-that type of spectacle utopia, do you really wish to make it a reality?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1499"><span>Oh, he really got spooked by it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1500"><span>A prominent nobleman who doesn’t show emotion, now I’ve got him panicked,</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1501"><span>「Yeah, this power is gained for that purpose. There is no use talking about ideals when you don’t have power, and won’t you feel empty to only have power but no ideal? I’m a rather greedy individual, but I’m not interested in something along the line of a one-way pursuit of power.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1502"><span>I tried to paraphrase some quotes I remembered before and used them as my message.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1503"><span>But, shouldn’t it be natural to think this way?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1504"><span>You work hard when you have a goal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1505"><span>That’s human nature, to my understanding.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1506"><span>「Ha, hahaha, HAHAHAHA! Nice, very nice, Demon Lord Rimuru! What a greedy Demon Lord! Now I finally understand why you’ve awakened!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1507"><span>Elalude begins to laugh out loud. I waited until he finished.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1508"><span>After he finishes laughing, Elalude kneels before me as a messenger.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1509"><span>「Many apologies if i offended you.

It’s Diablo.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1542"><span>He’s been quietly observing the conference and awaiting orders behind me.

Don’t judge me based on my appearance, I am known as the most terrifying and one of the strongest among the Ten Great Demon Lords!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1563"><span>Ramiris still puffs out her chest proudly despite Diablo’s restraint, and with a smug look too. She hasn’t realized herself that there is no prestige to how she looks at all right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1564"><span>「Eh? Demon Lord….?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1565"><span>「Hah!this thing is what now?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1566"><span>And words along those lines could be heard from the surrounding members of the meeting.

I am 『Fairy of the Labyrinth』, you know? Why is everyone so calm?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1568"><span>No no no, even though you claim to be a demon lord, you are currently being restrained.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1569"><span>But I guess, everyone is probably baffled right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1570"><span>I considered them kind for not voicing such thoughts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1571"><span>「No actually…….Since Rimuru-sama is a Demon Lord as well, it’s reasonable to expect him to know other Demon Lords…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1572"><span>「Or perhaps I’ve gotten over the shock of the 『Storm Dragon』’s revival, so I’m kinda numb to these things now…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1573"><span>People started talking and nodding to each other.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1574"><span>I see, it makes more sense with the way they said it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1575"><span>And looking back to Ramiris, she seems rather annoyed by everyone’s reaction.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1576"><span>「Huh? 『Storm Dragon』.... You mean, has Veldora revived? Ha, you’ve all been tricked! I’ve blown away Veldora with one punch! That guy isn’t even worth mentioning. Anyway, his reign should have ended already. So if you’re all afraid of him, you should start worshipping me from now on!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1577"><span>She begins to laugh loudly as she went on a tangent.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1578"><span>Please stop making a fool of yourself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1579"><span>I, taking Ramiris from Diablo, bought her over to Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1580"><span>「Sorry, Veldora, could you spend some time with this kid? She’s a Demon Lord after all, so maybe the two of you could be friends?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1581"><span>「Huh? I’m busy solving a big mystery here.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1582"><span>Veldora doesn’t want the be troubled and planned to turn me down. But I won’t compromise like that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1583"><span>「Oh, about that, the criminal is XXXX.</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Please do not condone this behavior and do not spoil people" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;Alright, mystery solved? I’ll leave the rest to you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1584"><span>I ruthlessly revealed the criminal’s identity and go back to my seat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1585"><span>Veldora opens his eyes wide like he’s been deeply traumatized. His eyes seemed to carry the message 「Ehhhhh? Spoiler alert??」. It’s a bit mean of me to do that, but we are in a meeting here. Also I meant that for him to reflect on himself, so I couldn’t let the opportunity go.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1586"><span>As far as Ramiris goes, she has since fainted upon seeing Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1587"><span>As such, the two maladjusted children have settled down so I used the chance to restart the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1588"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1589"><span>First I need to confirm some unattended business.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1590"><span>「Benimaru, the enemy is Clayman.

I don’t think anyone besides me heard that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1604"><span>「But this Clayman, he’s no Demon Lord you can afford to underestimate! It’s said that he has many Majins under his rule, and it’s rumored that he even has connections with the Eastern Empire….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1605"><span>Elalude cautiously adds, however——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1606"><span>「Don’t worry. War is not about quantity, but quality.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1607"><span>I proudly express my (unexpected) opinion and shut him up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1608"><span>「Ah, I think I can hear the sound of my common sense collapsing in my head….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1609"><span>Even though Elalude responds in shock, he still looks rather interested in our power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1610"><span>Even I feel my statement’s rather illogical but I’m definitely right.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1611"><span>Generally in war, the larger the size of the army, the more of an advantage said army will have, but this does not work in this world. The battle against the Orc Lord would be a good example. As soon as we took down the enemy generals, the battle was essentially concluded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1612"><span>Additionally, our numbers are looking quite compelling this time around.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1613"><span>Souei has gone to investigate Clayman’s movements. And since the meeting will be going on for some time, I decide to hear his report first.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1614"><span>He’s still investigating their specific number currently. As of right now they are known to be staying in Milim’s territory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1615"><span>Souei’s 「Clone」 should be returning anytime now, so I’ll be able to make a judgement about that soon. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_1616"><span>There’s still more to discuss regarding our war tactics.

Have they revealed any useful information?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1629"><span>Since she can do whatever she wants to these people, I’ve sorta forgotten about them after leaving them in Shion’s care.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1630"><span>「Hehehe, of course, Rimuru-sama!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1631"><span>Oh ho, Shion’s quite confident.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1632"><span>I’ve got an itchy dangerous feeling from her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1633"><span>Youmu and <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also accompanied the investigation, I shifted my gaze towards them both but they seem like they are avoiding my eyes out of embarrassment. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_1634"><span>Still averting my gaze, they begin their report.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1635"><span>「——About that, Master. Investigation? Interrogation? Basically, the captives did reveal some information.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1636"><span>「Yeah, they did……. But that wasn’t really an investigation, and calling it an interrogation is even further from the truth…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1637"><span>You guys can stop here now. I really don’t want to hear the rest of it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1638"><span>Shion must have outdone herself. But since it was me who appointed her to the job, I shouldn’t and don’t plan on being the one complaining about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1639"><span>Either way, they wouldn’t have any way of stopping the deranged Shion anyway. Since I was in the cave that whole time, it didn’t seem like they’d be able to contact me either.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1640"><span>If someone were to be held responsible, I should be the one as I failed to find the right person for the job. In other words, let’s pretend I never found out about this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1641"><span>Sorry, my friends from Farmas, but after all, it’s you guys who are at fault for making the first move.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1642"><span>I hope you will all understand that just surviving in and of itself is quite lucky.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1643"><span>That’s why I took the three captives alive.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1644"><span>After Shion’s interrogation——I mean investigation (torture), they’ve revealed plenty of information.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1645"><span>「First off, we have Ed….Ednew? Eddie?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1646"><span>「——Isn’t it King Edmalis?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1647"><span>Seeing Shion’s struggle, Shuna whispers into Shion’s ear and gave her the answer she was struggling to come up with. How reliable.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1648"><span>Conversely, is shion really okay? it seems like she’s incapable of even remembering the name of a King….. Well, his name is pretty weird so, whatever.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1649"><span>「It would seem that some Merchants had approached King Edmalis in the past and presented the silk product from our country. That led the King to act on his greed. Apart from that, they were afraid that our nation would become an important trading hub in the future, which is what led to the incident this time——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1650"><span>Shion continues to explain her findings which are all inline my prediction. If we have to get specific here, I would have suspected that this merchant instigated Edmalis into committing these treacheries.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1651"><span>「Did you find out the identity of this merchant? Could he be an appointed merchant?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1652"><span>「About that…. I’m very sorry.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1653"><span>Shion looks dejected like a</span><span>&nbsp;leaking balloon</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="i do not understand this analogy" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>. I immediately began to comfort her. That was just a question I happen to think up, so it’s not really that important to me honestly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1654"><span>「That doesn’t really matter, what about the Church?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1655"><span>I decided to pursue a different topic; let’s see what type of information Archbishop Rayhiem has.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1656"><span>「Yes! I’ve obtained information about the mastermind.

In addition, this person needs to be able to travel fast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1803"><span>Souei is the most suitable candidate, but I wish to see how he performs on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1804"><span>Benimaru is the leading general of the army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1805"><span>Shion is a no go.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1806"><span>Hakurou can’t use 「Shadow Step」 and 「Dimension Transportation」, making transportation more time-consuming.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1807"><span>As for Geld and Gabiru, their appearances are too eye-catching in human society. And considering their personalities, they definitely aren’t the most qualified strategists here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1808"><span>In lieu of all this, Diablo is the only person able to fulfill all these conditions. He once said he is willing to take down <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom himself, so he shouldn’t be objecting to it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1809"><span>And I also want someone to watch over that troubling guy Larzen, surely Diablo should be able to handle it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1810"><span>「I’ll be counting on you, Diablo!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1811"><span>「Yes, I understand, Rimuru-sama!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1812"><span>Diablo gives out a joy-filled smile upon accepting my request.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1813"><span>Something’s amiss about this, but since he’s agreed to it, it’s no problem. I can picture Diablo right now as the strongest here after Veldora and me. He should be able to act accordingly no matter what happens.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1814"><span>「It might take a few years, so you’ve got to keep your composure. Whatever happens, you can contact me whenever you wish using 「Telepathy Net」.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1815"><span>「No problem. It won’t take that long, I will quickly resolve the issue.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1816"><span>Such a confident response, we’re talking about eliminating an entire country here. But it is precisely because of that, I am able to confidently task him with this mission. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_1817"><span>Now that we have one less problem to deal with. We can now fully focus on waging total war against the Demon Lord Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1818"><span>As such, our time for making confirmations for the arrangements has come to an end. So the meeting with the heads of nations is concluded for now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1819"><span>At the very end I want to confirm whether there is any other issue anyone wishes to address. And it turns out someone did raise their hand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1820"><span>It’s Elalude. He looks at me as if &nbsp;wanting to say something.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1821"><span>「What’s wrong?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1822"><span>Hearing this, Elalude begins to speak up without hesitation</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1823"><span>「My nation Sorcerer’s Dynasty Sarion is also quite a ways off from here——That is the Tempest Federation. There are very annoying forests and mountains in between our nations. If there were a direct path between our nations, it would greatly reduce the time spent in travelling. If we are able to open a road &nbsp;between us, it would be highly convenient for our exchanges——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1824"><span>He winks at me as he finishes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1825"><span>Hmm huh——I know where he is getting at.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1826"><span>Since we’ve established ties with the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion, it would be much more convenient to have a direct road constructed between each other. Of course our country would undertake such construction.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1827"><span>The benefit is being able to directly transport goods instead of taking the previously longer detour, that is why I’ve considered it as part of my plan from the start.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1828"><span>But the construction would require a mass-reform of the land, for instance, deforestation, digging of tunnels, as well as paving operations on the roads. It will expend a massive national budget in order to execute all of the above operations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1829"><span>The Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion may be strong, but that doesn’t mean it can easily provide a budget on the scale of this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1830"><span>Elalude, by his careful consideration from the standpoint of a Duke, would likely push all the work on to us.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1831"><span>「Elalude, you are being real scummy here. How could Rimuru agree so easily to such a substantial request.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1832"><span>Gazel decides to defend me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1833"><span>But hold on a second, didn’t we take responsibility for the entire project of constructing the direct roads to Dwargon?!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1834"><span>「Surely you jest, Gazel! It’s perfectly reasonable for Rimuru-dono to reject me, you of all people should know that you don’t have a say in this!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1835"><span>Ah, so Elalude knows about that as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1836"><span>Could we have avoided this had we rejected Gazel’s request?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1837"><span>To be honest, it’s alright if we are to take full responsibility. Constructing roads is just a small investment compared to having more human recognition.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1838"><span>But with that being said, if I just agree to it like this, it may encourage other countries to take advantage of us in our future diplomatic relationships. Just like how I was taken advantage of during my trip by <span data-term="Brumund" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom. Humans are truly cunning creatures.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1839"><span>So I’ve got to knock him down from his high horse.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1840"><span>「I understand what Duke Elalude meant. I believe is fine for us to handle the construction of the road, however——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1841"><span>「However?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1842"><span>Elalude gulps as he looks towards me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1843"><span>Don’t be so nervous, I don’t plan on doing anything outrageous.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1844"><span>「However, we would also be the ones responsible for the security and hotel business on the road. And of course, the cost of construction would eventually be transferred to the road users via a carefully considered toll.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1845"><span>I add.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1846"><span>In simpler terms, we will create a charging mechanism like those on highways. Travelers will be charged a certain fee per distance away from an alarm outpost. This will turn into long-term profits. Despite how it seems to be unprofitable in the short term, it would gradually transition to profitability as time goes on. This is the so called conscienceless national income.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1847"><span>Additionally, we get to do another country a favour by taking the job of constructing a road.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1848"><span>「——I understand now, that’s a great idea. And it sounds very reasonable. But, regarding the toll you mentioned. I hope we get to renegotiate it every couple of years.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1849"><span>Oh? Elalude is not so simple-minded after all. I see that he has guessed my thoughts immediately.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1850"><span>No problem, we will have to build this type of thing on the basis of consensus. There is no point in pricing the toll too high, hence I will accept his suggestion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1851"><span>「Okay, we should do just that!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1852"><span>「So casual!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1853"><span>Fuze blurts out in surprise, but I don’t really mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1854"><span>Diplomacy is all about judgement.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1855"><span>「Geld! You’ve got more work to schedule!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1856"><span>「Understood! Much Obliged. We’ve learnt much about labor coordination from all the projects we undertook so far, and some even gained the skill of supply and earth manipulation from transporting resources. Whatever work Rimuru-sama give us will be the best field for military training! 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1857"><span>EH! Ah, so…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1858"><span>That’s how they feel about their work.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1859"><span>And I thought Geld was a sensible man, but as it turns out, he's quite the aggressive war-monger too. What a surprise. It left me speechless for a moment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1860"><span>「Ah-Okay then. If that’s the case, we’ve got to end the battle quickly and start working early.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1861"><span>「Indeed. Do come around to check on the results of our daily training!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1862"><span>Geld seems very motivated.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1863"><span>He would definitely be very active during the battle against Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1864"><span>No other person seems to have much else to say.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1865"><span>After all the twists and turns, our meeting has finally concluded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1866"><span>All the nations involved in the meeting have their own agendas. They exchange their views in an effort to create a world where Humans and </span><span>monsters can</span><span>&nbsp;coexist.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1867"><span>This meeting that took place without prior scheduling——The future generations call it the Meeting of Man and M</span><span>onster</span><span>——Iis considered a significant historical turning point. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_1868"><span>——A big step forward again towards our ideal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1869"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1870"><span>Now that the meeting with the national leaders has concluded for some time now, we can finally conduct the military meeting regarding the war against Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1871"><span>I’ve had everyone be ready in the hopes that they would all listen to Souei’s report together with me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1872"><span>I feel as though I’ve forgotten about something….. With that thought I realize...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1873"><span>Right, Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1874"><span>What was that annoying fairy actually trying to say?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1875"><span>Come to think of it, is she still passed out?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1876"><span>I am starting to worry about her so I decide to see &nbsp;Veldora and check up on her condition….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1877"><span>I can’t believe this is happening.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1878"><span>Ramiris is over there intently focused on reading manga.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1879"><span>And here I thought I would make her cry if I don’t go spend some time with her. That concern is clearly unnecessary.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1880"><span>「——Oi, you there, what in the world are you doing?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1881"><span>I had to ask.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1882"><span>「Hush! I’m just getting to the good part, talk to you later.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1883"><span>Ramiris won’t even raise her head, and instead makes this comment to try and sneak out of the conversation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1884"><span>What is she doing here anyway?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1885"><span>Currently she’s got all her attention on manga, but didn’t she have something important to say?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1886"><span>Perhaps it went down like this——Ramiris who awakened from her coma was about to cause a scene but discovered the scattered manga on the bench. Then she was drawn to the manga so much that she immersed herself in its world, not even realizing that the meeting has ended.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1887"><span>She seems awfully similar to Veldora. It’s almost as if her fainting was an act. The two now are so close that both are requesting services from Beretta.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1888"><span>I’m speechless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1889"><span>I shift my gaze towards Beretta.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1890"><span>「I should congratulate you for your evolution to Demon Lord. I’ve wanted to express my gratitude since I’ve also evolved thanks to your evolution. With your blessing, I have evolved from 『Arc Doll』 to 『Chaos Doll』」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1891"><span>As he finishes, he bows to me respectfully.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1892"><span>Beretta seems to have evolved into a Chaos Doll, which possess the opposing elements of Holy and Demonic at the same time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1893"><span>It may have resulted because of his unique skill 「Amanojaku」</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Amanojaku (天邪鬼) or Heavenly Evil Spirit is a demon-like creature from Japanese folktale.It is commonly used to describe individual with a twisted and often contrarian personality.

In other words, take Beretta for instance, his birthright as Demon race can be reversed to give him powers of the Angel race as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1895"><span>The new 「Spirit Core」 generated in Beretta’s body combined with the old 「Demonic Core」 ended up giving birth to 「Chaos Core」. It is said that when he utilizes the power of this Chaos Core, Beretta could even mitigate his past weakness, the Holy elements.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1896"><span>That’s just way too crafty——I believe I am not the only one with that thought.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1897"><span>With his body built from tight magisteel, most physical and magical attacks won’t be able to harm him. And on top of that, even his weakness got patched up. This is definitely one of the strongest evolutions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1898"><span>Him learning the unique skill 「Amanojaku」 also seems to be related to me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1899"><span>I think it’s probably my anxiety back then that granted him said abilities.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1900"><span>When I was trapped by the 「Holy Purification Barrier」, my magicules were sealed and I felt as though I were nothing. Perhaps that sensation led him to obtain such power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1901"><span>「Arc Doll」 operates on magicules and he knew that if he were in the same place, he would be rendered unable to move. That’s why his evolution is a solution to that concern.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1902"><span>Whether it is the unique skill 「Amanojaku」 or his 「Chaos Core」, these are all very intriguing research materials for me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1903"><span>《Report.

He only discovered my evolution after he himself evolved during the incident.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1912"><span>「Anyway, it’s reassuring to hear that you’ve been doing well. Let’s talk more when the business at hand is resolved. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1913"><span>「Haha, thank you for your care. I will be looking forward to that.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1914"><span>「Hmm, it’s great that you’ve got the ability to accommodate Ramiris’s whims now. Anyway, just follow her orders unless it’s something unreasonable and things should turn out fine.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1915"><span>「Leave it to me. I will definitely meet your expectations!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1916"><span>「Hmm, good luck. By the way, why did you guys come here?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1917"><span>I ask Beretta and steal a glance towards Ramiris who’s still buried in her manga.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1918"><span>「A-about that…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1919"><span>Beretta seems to recall the intent of their journey and begins approaching Ramiris in an attempt to persuade her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1920"><span>「Ramiris-sama, now is not the time for this. You should tell Rimuru-sama about that thing fast——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1921"><span>「You’re super annoying! I’m busy right now!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1922"><span>「Please state the intention of your visit.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1923"><span>「I-HAVE-TOLD-YOU! This is my destined encounter! In this great reading material called manga, which boy would the heroine choose—— 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1924"><span>Ramiris speaks as if she’s justified.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1925"><span>Beretta sure has it hard.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1926"><span>Beretta seems too pitiful like this, but it can’t be helped.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1927"><span>I have a vague idea of the type of manga she is reading. With a sigh, I went over to threaten her. If I don’t, I may have to wait until she finishes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1928"><span>——By the way, that manga is a forty-volume long mega piece. Even if everyone says I am as kind and tolerant as a Buddha, there are things that even I can’t stand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1929"><span>「Oi, Ramiris. If you don’t want me to spoil who the heroine will fall in love with, state your business here immediately!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1930"><span>My prediction that my intimidation would work was spot on.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1931"><span>「YES!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1932"><span>She springs up with both hands while trying to recall the intention of her visit.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1933"><span>Seeing how casual she looks, surely she has some mundane news to report. It must have only been her own exaggerations before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1934"><span>The other guests from different nations who were chatting and packing up in preparation to return home also seem to recall that there is this Ramiris here. They all paused their actions and probably also want to hear what she has to say before leaving.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1935"><span>Ramiris seems rather pleased with the situation and puffs out her flat chest. She crosses her arms and begins nodding as if she has something on her mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1936"><span>Then——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1937"><span>「I will say this one more time! This country is going to perish!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1938"><span>That line came right out of her mouth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1939"><span>「W-what did you say——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1940"><span>I respond flatly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1941"><span>Then Ramiris begins to follow up insatiably, as if she has granted me a great favour.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1942"><span>「Huh huh! Eh, I didn’t want to see that happening either, that’s why I came to inform you, so be thankful!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1943"><span>It would probably take too long for me to deal with her seriously, so I’d just have to casually respond.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1944"><span>「So, why will our country perish?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1945"><span>「About that, before I could tell you the reason——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1946"><span>Ramiris pauses and switches to a more serious expression. First she glances around at all the important individuals from each country, and with a slight consideration she continues with a nod.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1947"><span>「Alright, this may still be relevant to humans. Very well, you guys should hear it too. Demon Lord Clayman has proposed to initiate the Walpurgis Banquet!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1948"><span>「Walpurgis Banquet?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1949"><span>「Yes, Walpurgis Banquet. The special meeting where Demon Lords across the world sit under one roof.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1950"><span>What in the world, when she said “initiated”, I thought it was some sort of grand magic. Wouldn’t it be worrying if he took the initiative in attacking when we are in the midst of planning an attack ourselves?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1951"><span>After further inquiry with Ramiris, I discover that Walpurgis Banquet seems to mean having all the Demon Lord gathered at one place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1952"><span>In order to initiate the Walpurgis Banquet, it requires approval from at least three Demon Lords. Once initiated, all Demon Lords have a high level of obligation to attend. It is one of the few agreements among the Demon Lords to force Demon Lords, who are acting as they desire, into order.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1953"><span>It is said also that some of the more casual individuals wouldn’t attend the meeting themselves, but instead they would appoint their subordinates to attend in their stead.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1954"><span>「——If that’s the case, there are records which states that there will be a great war after each meeting among Demon Lords. That’s why the Western Saints Church decided to name that day the Walpurgis Banquet.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1955"><span>According to Elalude, it is a document from about a thousand years ago that recorded the event. It is said that the Great War has led to great catastrophe with heavy casualties.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1956"><span>Due to the Western Saints Church naming the event &nbsp;Walpurgis Banquet, the people all think it means 「The Demon Lords’ feast that will destroy world and plunge it into </span><span>chaos.</span><span>」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1957"><span>The so called great war is probably referring to the great world war that has happened countless times.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1958"><span>Or is it really true that when the Demon Lords gather, there will be a great war? Or could it be that they were preparing to provide support to someone for a great war?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1959"><span>「Does that mean that the great war was caused by the Demon Lords?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1960"><span>「No way! I don’t have that kind of free time, isn’t waging war super complicated? No one wants to do that!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1961"><span>Ramiris instantly dismissed my doubts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1962"><span>No matter how you look at her, she looks like she’s got all the spare time in the world…… No, nevermind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1963"><span>Now that I think about it, she is one of the Demon Lord too. And she seems to have lived for quite a long time, so it wouldn’t be strange if she had attended the meeting a thousand years ago.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1964"><span>Then, Elalude nods to Ramiris and proceeds to say:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1965"><span>「Demon Lord Ramiris’ words are probably true. The great war has the official name 『Tenma Great War』 (Great War between Angels and Demons), where all major forces are competing for control. With that being said——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1966"><span>According to Elalude, the great war takes place every five hundred years.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1967"><span>The reason for that: it is said that the angelic force from heaven would attack the earth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1968"><span>The army from heaven——meaning the angel race.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1969"><span>The angels are like the </span><span>monster</span><span>’s natural nemesis , but they attack indiscriminately.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1970"><span>Or rather, for some reason, they always pick the most advanced cities to attack first. The reason is unknown, but, that is just a rumour.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1971"><span>「That’s the reason why we’ve stayed underground and refuse to come out.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1972"><span>Says Gazel.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1973"><span>The development of Dwargon is going well and is surely going to be eye-catching, so this decision is most definitely the right one.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1974"><span>It’s the same case for the Sorcerer's Dynasty Sarion which has its cities built inside the giant caverns of the God Tree. I recall Gazel mentioning the 「City embraced by the God Tree」 to Elalude. It must have been a reference to this fact.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1975"><span>The two powerful nations both took the necessary precautions involving national defense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1976"><span>On the other hand, the Western Nations——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1977"><span>The Council——It was made up of Western Nations in order to defend against the </span><span>monster</span><span>s. And the other reason is to survive the Great War.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1978"><span>The countries in the council pledge to help each other out, while Dawrgon and Sarion are both able to hold their own ground. The enemy here is the angel race alone——But it’s not the entire story.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1979"><span>When the angel race attacks , the </span><span>monster</span><span>s also become more active. The </span><span>monster</span><span>s in question are ones that possess intelligence, aka the Majins.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1980"><span>Some Demon Lords would take advantage of the great war to invade human nations. It was the case a thousand years ago and tales depict it to be a brutal scene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1981"><span>Even so, the humans themselves aren’t enemies to be underestimated either.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1982"><span>The current hypothetical enemy, the Eastern Empire——Sovereign Alliance of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria Empire, could be onto something. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_1983"><span>The hegemonism</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Hegemony is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;of the Eastern Empire doesn't care for time or location. They could very well march against the Western Nations as soon as they discover their weakness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1984"><span>In conclusion, this is the great war mixed with Angels, </span><span>monster</span><span>s and Humans——so called 「Tenma Great War」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1985"><span>If that’s the case, it would be a false accusation to blame the Demon Lords as the cause of the Great War.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1986"><span>I myself also wouldn’t want to start a war either.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1987"><span>Speaking of which, if the angels attack the more advanced nations first...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1988"><span>I was hoping to develop this town and outrank other cities in prosperity. But, this can wait I suppose.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1989"><span>It would be wise to at least hold off on that for now and we prioritize the development and fortification of essential infrastructure for defense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1990"><span>But that would come later, I need to make a mental note of that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1991"><span>First we have to deal with the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1992"><span>「If that’s the case, what is the point of the Walpurgis Banquet? Why are all the Demon Lords gathering?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1993"><span>If it’s not related to the great war, there must be other goals…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1994"><span>Ah, could that be it? Milim did said that the Demon Lords would judge individuals who self proclaim to be a Demon Lord. Could they be holding a meeting to decide on sending someone to deal with me?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1995"><span>「About that——First off, you seem to have misunderstood, so allow me to explain.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1996"><span>Right after which, Ramiris speaks of something that’s the furthest from what I could imagination.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1997"><span>「We actually hold the Banquet quite often. It only needs three or more Demon Lords’ approval to initiate, so it’s not hard. In it’s past, it’s the equivalent of me, Guy, and Milim having a little tea party——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1998"><span>Ramiris tells us and continues:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_1999"><span>「In other words the Walpurgis Banquet is just the Demon Lords gathering together to update each other on each others’ status while discussing trending topics. It’s just that the humans certainly wouldn’t know about that, but it’s really nothing dramatic. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2000"><span>She breaks the huge news.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2001"><span>I always thought that this fairy is too simple minded and probably has a horrifyingly large gap in perception compared to the rest of the Demon Lords. So I can’t exactly take her words seriously, or it may really lead to something tragic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2002"><span>I’ve got to scold her for it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2003"><span>「Idiot! If it’s just a small tea party, why would you say our nation is doomed?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2004"><span>She’s really done it this time getting someone as gentle as me angry.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2005"><span>This annoying brat sure is stupid.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2006"><span>「Ah, no! The problem isn’t the Banquet itself, it’s the subject-matter!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2007"><span>Ramiris corrects herself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2008"><span>The subject-matter? So the Demon Lords have indeed gathered to exterminate me….?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2009"><span>According to what Ramiris just said, there are two other people supporting Clayman’s initiation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2010"><span>They are Demon Lord Frey and Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2011"><span>Due to the three Demon Lords’ motion, including that of Clayman, the proposal is approved.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2012"><span>Apart from that, the subject of discussion is——「The rise of the new force in the Great Jura Forest and the Leader of the Forest Alliance dares to proclaim himself as a Demon Lord.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2013"><span>It must be talking about me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2014"><span>「I mean did you….. Did you proclaim yourself a Demon Lord?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2015"><span>「Yeah, and I don’t regret it, nor do I intend to reflect on it!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2016"><span>I replied honestly since Ramris asked.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2017"><span>「Hmm——I am not surprised it’s you. You should be fine as long as you stay tenacious, even though there may be a lot of trouble on the way.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2018"><span>Says Ramiris sounding quite relaxed and delighted, as if it’s none of her business. No, it’s indeed none of her business.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2019"><span>Anyhow, I’ve already prepared myself mentally, so anything goes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2020"><span>「So, are they going to punish me?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2021"><span>They’ve indeed planned on punishing me——Or so I thought, but things seem different from what I hear from Ramiris soon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2022"><span>「That is the case in name, but whether you get punished is not the point, it’s simply an unwritten rule in our industry. Clayman initiated the Banquet because he claimed Demon Lord <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has betrayed everyone. Not only that, Clayman is also going to press the issue that his subordinate <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was murdered.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2023"><span>Is being Demon Lord considered a job? What industry are you talking about? I teased her but got ignored.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2024"><span>It seems that Clayman is claiming someone has murdered <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and would probably say the criminal is 「The new-comer named Rimuru who dares to proclaim himself as a Demon Lord」. His goal is likely——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2025"><span>《Report. Presumably he is planning to take over the territory of Demon Lord <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and subjugate the Great Jura Forest.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2026"><span>——Probably. I think so as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2027"><span>Is that why Clayman’s army has taken action?Clayman wants to take the initiative before we could act.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2028"><span>Demon Lord Clayman is better than expected——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2029"><span>「You! How come you are so calm in the face of such an important issue! According to my source, <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seems to have been beaten by Milim. Majins under Clayman also seemed to have commenced military operation. In other words, you are no longer being judged, this is already war ! Clayman has found the excuse to attack you all out!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2030"><span>Even under these circumstances, Ramiris, looking surprisingly serious, went on a tangent.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2031"><span>Her words caused the crowd to panic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2032"><span>To even some bigger nations, it’s a tremendous deal when a Demon Lord is getting attacked.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2033"><span>That’s to be expected. After all, it may upset the balance of power between the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2034"><span>I was expecting it myself, but it was a very big surprise for the rest of the guests. This seems to be a serious topic for discussion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2035"><span>Also——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2036"><span>「How dare you say that <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is a traitor! How rude——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2037"><span>「Clayman cannot be forgiven. Nice idea of his, but I’ll crush his ambitions.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2038"><span>「Even without <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, our army is still around. We won’t allow Clayman’s subordinates to just do what they want!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2039"><span>The ones who reacted the most are no doubt the three Beastketeers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2040"><span>That is to be expected. Since Clayman has by himself declared their master a traitor.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2041"><span>And according to what Ramiris said, Clayman also seems interested in taking over <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s territory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2042"><span>We are a step behind. I can’t believe he’s taking action so fast…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2043"><span>But you can’t expect him to be acting with good intentions, so we have to clean this mess up soon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2044"><span>「Calm down, Ramiris. I did proclaim myself to be a Demon Lord, but I didn’t kill <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2045"><span>「What do you mean by that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2046"><span>「Nothing in particular, those are lies by Clayman. I expected that he would come looking to punish me by accusing me of killing <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2047"><span>Besides——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2048"><span>「H-hold on a second? Do you have a single fact to back that up?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2049"><span>Well about that——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2050"><span>「——Pardon me, Demon Lord Ramiris-sama. Please allow me to speak. The one who is rumoured to be dead (<span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who’s Clayman’s Majin subordinate) is actually me ...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2051"><span>I plan on thoroughly destroying Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2052"><span>I intended to have him misjudge the situation of <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s death, hence why I’ve expected Clayman to make a move.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2053"><span>It’s not me who got baited, instead it’s Clayman fell for my trap.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2054"><span>This has nothing to do with the other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2055"><span>Ramiris is astonished upon hearing <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s name, but she regained her composure shortly after.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2056"><span>「Ah? Eh? That would mean…… I get it! The real criminal is Demon Lord Clayman!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2057"><span>I think anyone can see that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2058"><span>Ramiris begins to brag about her deduction.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2059"><span>But sadly, it is an easy deduction anyone could make.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2060"><span>「Oh, I agree with your view, but I’ve got something to ask too.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2061"><span>I kinda pity here, so I played along a little.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2062"><span>Additionally, I have some concerns with regards to some of her claims so I decided to ask.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2063"><span>「Oh, what’s the matter? Why don’t you just ask me, the famed detective Ramiris?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2064"><span>Ah crap, I was just playing along and now she’s gotten all cocky.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2065"><span>And where did this famed detective come from?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2066"><span>Could it be that she also had a sneak peek at Veldora’s manga too? No, that’s not my concern right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2067"><span>I need to ask my questions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2068"><span>「What would the other Demon Lords do in circumstances such as this?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2069"><span>I don’t have many expectations for her, but I’ll ask anyway.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2070"><span>After all, she’s probably a good reference source since she’s been a Demon Lord for such a long time. I asked this question based on all these considerations…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2071"><span>The assembly quiets down awaiting Ramiris’ answer. The others are also interested in finding out the answer to my question.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2072"><span>Ramiris however doesn’t seem to care.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2073"><span>「Uhh? How am I supposed to know? I’ve only been told about the Banquet initiation and was told to participate!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2074"><span>She answered without a care.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2075"><span>Of course, it’s a waste expecting anything from her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2076"><span>She’s a little kid after all. I’m lucky enough that she even bothered to come and report this to me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2077"><span>Next question,</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2078"><span>「Then Ramiris, let me ask you, when will the Walpurgis Banquet be held? Do you know a specific date?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2079"><span>In order to create a plan to defeat Clayman, I need to take that into consideration.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2080"><span>「Hmm, didn’t I tell you? Lemme think, I think it’s three days from now, the night of the new moon.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2081"><span>Three days from today, it seems earlier than I expected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2082"><span>It would be pretty difficult to try and take down Clayman in three days.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2083"><span>Hmm——How about this…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2084"><span>We will make a final stand with him after the Walpurgis Banquet?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2085"><span>Now I’ve got to discuss this with everyone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2086"><span>As such, I’ve asked Ramiris all the things I wanted. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2087"><span>Considering that seems to be the only thing Ramiris came here to do, I won’t be able to get more information out of her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2088"><span>And suddenly another thought hit me, so I decided to ask another question.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2089"><span>「Right, so why did you come here to inform us?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2090"><span>「Hmm? Well, honestly, if you got killed, I don’t know what would happen to my Beretta. That’s why I decided to make the trip to help you. That’s all it is. it’s why I also plan to build an entrance to the labyrinth here. It’s fine right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2091"><span>「You’d better be! Eh, how did we end up on that topic? And an entrance to the labyrinth, what the hell are you trying to build here?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2092"><span>I’m glad that you came to inform me but this seems to be a completely different matter.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2093"><span>「Eheh————! It’s really nothing, so don’t mind this type of small favour now!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2094"><span>She’s not even listening to me. That attitude seems to suggest the deal is already settled.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2095"><span>Seriously, this fairy sure is laid back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2096"><span>「I mind it a lot, and you’d better be cautious with your words! Also, please stop treating Beretta like some personal object you own!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2097"><span>You’d better not try and make any decision on your own——I’ll reject it without any hesitation. If you create an entrance to your labyrinth here, it will definitely lead to more trouble. And about the issue regarding Beretta, it’s not just about me. Beretta’s opinions matters in this too, so how could you “decide” just like that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2098"><span>The concerns that I had just sent the conversation on a pretty unexpected path.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2099"><span>We got into a heated debate that amounted to nothing. I can’t really stand that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2100"><span>In any case, we parted on the spot.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2101"><span>I'm currently quite busy too, so I have no time to spare hanging around with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2102"><span>She went back to reading her manga since she completed her mission.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2103"><span>I’ve also made promises with the guests from the other nations to check back with them on other information. They’ve also accepted. Aftward, the participants of the meeting left.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2104"><span>Fuze decides to stay in the inn for the night before returning.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2105"><span>「Now that your nation has caught the ire of the Demon Lords, do prepare yourself. Demon Lords are dangerous existence. Even though I know, Rimuru-san, that you’re pretty powerful as well…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2106"><span>Says Fuze out of his worries for me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2107"><span>I understand him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2108"><span>In the worst case scenario, I might make foes out of several Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2109"><span>Within the Ten Great Demon Lords right now, who can we expect to become our enemies?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2110"><span>Demon Lord <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is still missing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2111"><span>Ramiris seems to suggest she would be on my side, so she can be excluded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2112"><span>As for Milim…… I’m worrying about her the most. She must have been tricked by someone, so I’ve got to plan for the worst.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2113"><span>If we end up in a stalemate for real, I may end up becoming enemies with the eight other Demon Lords. Despite that, even if we are to become enemies with just Milim, we’d better run as far as we can.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2114"><span>「Don’t worry, when there’s a will, there’s a way.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2115"><span>I said trying to reassure Fuze.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2116"><span>Elalude is also being scummy and wants to stay here for a few days, saying that he hasn’t had the chance to chat with Elen for far too long, </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2117"><span>We didn’t take him to an inn but, instead, to our luxury hotel. This facility is the pride of our nation and if we want to impress him, we will definitely have our hotel welcome the Grand Duke.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2118"><span>Speaking of Elalude, his professional and private personas are so different to see. He’s so attached to his daughter while Elen instead only wishes to stay away from him. I do pray that he won’t further anger Elen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2119"><span>Gazel also decides to spend the night so we arranged for him to stay at the hotel where Elalude is staying. I could tell from their conversation that they’ve known each other for a long time. It is rumoured that they’ve even fought alongside each other once, and Elalude also seems to be a very powerful mage.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2120"><span>It is quite surprising for sure, but since they would also be communicating with our nation in the future as well, it’s a good thing to have their friendship strengthened.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2121"><span>By the way, the guests at the meeting are all important figures.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2122"><span>In the future, these heads of nations would make an incredible impact on the way of life in the human nations. In retrospect, we are already equal in status.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2123"><span>Even though our meeting &nbsp;turned into a clown fiesta after that stubborn fairy showed up, &nbsp;it was still a fruitful meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2124"><span>As such, the meeting was dismissed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2125"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2126"><span>We didn't get a chance to rest afterwards.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2127"><span>We still have to draft our plans in case we incur the ire of the other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2128"><span>After we all had a chance to have our meals, we gather at the meeting room once again.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2129"><span>This time the only guests are the Beastketeers and <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2130"><span>Youmu and <span data-term="Grucius" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are preparing for their journey to come. <span data-term="Grucius" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to participate too but got rejected by the Beastketeers.

So we decided to let her assist us and attend the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2132"><span>The strange thing is that even Diablo decided to join.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2133"><span>「Kufufufufu, I don’t need to do any preparations.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2134"><span>Since he’s so adamant, I kind of have to accept his proposition. But his participation won’t matter too much even if he joins so I’ll just let him be.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2135"><span>Ramiris, for some reason, also joined in the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2136"><span>「Ah, it’s you! What’s this all about? What is going on?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2137"><span>As soon as I entered the meeting room, Ramiris flew up to me and complains.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2138"><span>「What’s what now?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2139"><span>I ask, as she begins to complain with a blush on her face.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2140"><span>Here’s what she had to say.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2141"><span>During the break time, she was brought to the canteen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2142"><span>I completely forgot about her, but there were people who came to spend time with her</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2143"><span>Indeed, those people were the Dryads such as Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2144"><span>They all once served under Ramiris when she was the Queen of Spirits and recognized Ramiris instantly.Ramiris received a warm welcome from them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2145"><span>「That sounds great.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2146"><span>「Yeah! It’s superb! That’s why I’m staying here too, Rimuru!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2147"><span>It seems Ramiris has taken a liking to this town. This Demon Lord who’s been alone and without subordinates gets all cocky once she receives some admiration.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2148"><span>Anyway, Ramiris was touring the town accompanied by others.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2149"><span>She was mesmerized by all the sights and decided to stay here from now on.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2150"><span>「I told you to not make any wild decisions on your own! Besides, Treyni-san and the other Dryads are the moderators of the Great Jura Forest. They live in a different place than us, so they can’t spend their every day accompanying you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2151"><span>The three Dryads sisters were looking really delighted while waiting behind Ramiris during the conversation. I sneak a glance towards them and continue to lecture Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2152"><span>But Ramiris won’t listen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2153"><span>「You meanie——! Isn’t it great, no matter what happens, you get to enjoy my assistance! The strongest, world dominating, Ramiris-sama——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2154"><span>If I ever need your help, it would probably——No, I shouldn’t say it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2155"><span>If I tell her my honest opinion it would probably make Ramiris cry.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2156"><span>「Rimuru-sama, we will take care of Ramiris-sama, please view it in a positive light.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2157"><span>「「「Please consider it!」」」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2158"><span>Not only Ramiris, even Treyni-san and her sisters begin asking me for this favour.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2159"><span>But, no matter how you look at it, all she seems to be is a troublemaker. If Ramiris ends up just casually running around here while we get more communication with humans in the future, she will definitely become an eyesore.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2160"><span>Hmm——I’ll need to think on this request some more.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2161"><span>「I understand, I’ll take it into consideration…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2162"><span>「Really! Sasuga Rimuru, such a doll!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2163"><span>I’ll figure out what type of situations we may run into when Ramiris comes to this town later.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2164"><span>Right now I’ve got other issues to deal with.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2165"><span>With Ramiris quieting down, we can finally commence our military meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2166"><span>「Well then, I know everyone must be exhausted from the long meetings, but I hope you will all endure it for a just a bit more. Right now we have two subjects to discuss. First being the『Battle against Clayman』 and the other is the『Walpurgis Banquet』. Thanks to the information provided by Ramiris-chan here, I know we’ve been targeted. Let’s first hear Souei’s report and draft an attack plan. Souei, please tell us about Clayman’s army. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2167"><span>「Yes sir!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2168"><span>After my opening speech, Souei begins the report.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2169"><span>Just as we were having the meeting, Clayman’s army seemed to be on the move.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2170"><span>They’ve been resting in Mlim’s territory and entering combat formation. Apart from that——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2171"><span>「The one leading the army doesn’t seem to be Clayman himself. The commander has brought several Majins with an unusual amount of magicules, but they are about the same level as the Beastketeers. It is too weak to be Demon Lord Clayman.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2172"><span>Souei concludes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2173"><span>But, that guy sure is arrogant…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2174"><span>「If we are talking about Clayman’s subordinates that can rival the Beastketeers, there are three that come to my mind——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2175"><span>So many! I see no matter how despicable he is, he is still a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2176"><span>They are: 「Middle Finger」 Yamza, 「Index finger」 Adalman, and「The thumb」 The Nine-headed Beast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2177"><span>These three seem to be the members of Clayman’s proud organization known as the「Five-Fingers」. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2178"><span>Myuran apparently was the 「Ring Finger」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2179"><span>Additionally, there is the「Pinkie Finger」Piorra. That guy seems to rarely show up given his role as an intelligence collector.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2180"><span>I’m more concerned about the Moderate Jester Association, but <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> claims to know nothing about them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2181"><span>「Clayman is the type of Demon Lord that won’t even trust his subordinates. I won’t be surprised if he has ordered someone else to overlook the operation.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2182"><span>Is he like the audience watching a puppet show?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2183"><span>It may end up like the Orc Lord incident where people are operating even without the knowledge of Clayman’s subordinates’ involvement. We need to be cautious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2184"><span>「About that, <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who is the commander?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2185"><span>Souei saw a slim Majin and reported that he’s the commanding general. 「Telepathy Net」 sure is convenient for sharing information with everyone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2186"><span>「He is Yamza. The Magic Frost Swordsman Yamza. He is a despicable and cruel scumbag, but nonetheless a powerful individual. I didn’t get along well with him given the fact that he voluntarily pledged his loyalty towards Clayman.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2187"><span>So, the commander is Yamza.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2188"><span>From <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s description, he seems to be the strongest Majin within the Five-Fingers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2189"><span>Clayman gave him a priceless magic sword possessing the power of </span><span>freezing</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="I think there could be a better word" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>, and the infamous title of Magic Frost Swordsman which has spread across the land.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2190"><span>In other words, his capabilities are still unknown.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2191"><span>As for Clayman’s army, it consists of thirty thousand Majins led by Yamza.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2192"><span>Each and every one of which possesses a different ability.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2193"><span>From Souei’s observation, eighty percent of them are of Rank B. The remaining ones are almost all A-. Some of the higher ranked officers may even reach Rank A or are on par with Gelmud in terms of power. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2194"><span>Although they are a lot more powerful in comparison to the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Army I eliminated, there is still little to fear.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2195"><span>The problem lies with the commander Yamza or rather, it disappoints me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2196"><span>「Aren’t they a little too weak?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2197"><span>On our side, there are more than twenty thousand people who have taken refuge here from the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania. Half of them are capable of combat, making up roughly ten thousand people. They are already Rank B under normal circumstances, and they would even evolve to A- after their beastilization, which makes them an incredible force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2198"><span>Even the Knight Order from <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom averaged out to Rank B with their magic fortification. It just goes to show how strong the Beast Kingdom warriors are.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2199"><span>Not to mention the huge gap between the basic abilities of Humans and Beastmen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2200"><span>Just these people alone can form a huge combat force. In addition, there are other available combatants spread around. After they retreated from the capital, they reunited with Beastmen members from the nearby tribes scattered over the land. The veterans from the Beast King Army took command of these individuals and rearranged them into a capable force hiding near the area. With these forces combined, there will be an additional ten thousand soldiers. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2201"><span>That makes around twenty-thousand Ranked A- warriors. That indeed is an impressive amount of combat prowess. As expected from a Demon Lord who dominates his land.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2202"><span>「This is indeed strange. No matter how strong this Majin Yamza is, us Beastketeers will not lose to him. And even if we have less men in our army compared to them, we still have an overwhelming advantage in terms of the combat abilities of our warriors.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2203"><span>「Right. We are quite confident in leading soldiers to the war!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2204"><span>「Do they think they can look down on us because <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has passed away? No way, Clayman isn’t that stupid….. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2205"><span>Alvis agrees with my views.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2206"><span>Phobio and <span data-term="Suphia" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also followed up to express their opinions, believing that Clayman’s army won’t be much of a threat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2207"><span>If that’s the case</span><span>——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2208"><span>A mumble escapes Benimaru’s lips:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2209"><span>「Wait a second? Could it be that Clayman never intended to target this town?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2210"><span>Yeah, we may have been misled.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2211"><span>This town has constantly been a target, and with Ramiris telling us that we’ve become a target of Clayman’s, we might have been misled into believing that &nbsp;this town is his target.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2212"><span>I was planning on initiating a pincer-attack on Clayman’s army when he passes through Yuurazania in order to beat him….. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2213"><span>But things aren’t as simple as I expected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2214"><span>「Does he want to attack the Beast Kingdom? There are only refugees plus the ten thousand warriors in the area. Even with a higher quality of warriors, they would not be able to overcome the vast gulf in numbers. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2215"><span>It does make sense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2216"><span>According to Souei, his army is residing in Milim’s territory for now. However, his army has already begun reorganization. Tomorrow, if not the day after, he would likely march on the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2217"><span>It is unlikely they would take any action tonight, but I have to consider that as a possibility as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2218"><span>「This might mean that clayman doesn’t know about us given we’ve been extra cautious of him——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2219"><span>Geld calmly states, but I won't put too much expectation on it. We must plan for the worst-case scenario in order to remain adaptable to various situations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2220"><span>「If he is indeed heading to this town, Clayman won’t ignore the many dangers lying behind him. So he would likely only commence that operation after getting rid of all the threats」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2221"><span>Myuran concludes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2222"><span>Indeed, that’s exactly how I would go about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2223"><span>Is that the case, eh, getting rid of threats?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2224"><span>「Oi, do you mean then……. that Clayman plans to kill all of the remaining Beast Kingdom warriors?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2225"><span>It may be passable if he’s only killing the warriors but——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2226"><span>《Answer. Prediction towards Demon Lord Clayman has updated. The chances of his goal being to awaken as a「True Demon Lord」 is one hundred percent. Prediction: He would not include this town in his plan. While his method is sloppy with incorrect deductions, it is most certain that he would decimate all life forces within the borders of the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania——》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2227"><span>Is that so? Of course he is planning on killing everyone without mercy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2228"><span>I may sound rather hypocritical saying this, but his ruthless methods really appall me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2229"><span>Clayman is very cautious with his actions. He may even have his eyes on this town as part of his extended road map. In other words, he would most likely discover any reinforcements I send.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2230"><span>And even without considering that——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2231"><span>「Clayman has very strong intelligence gathering capabilities. That’s why he must have already known that the Beastketeers and <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s army have evacuated to this town. Besides, it will take at least two days to move from here to the Beast Kingdom…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2232"><span>We are at a complete disadvantage here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2233"><span>As <span data-term="Alvis" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, Clayman has seen through everything.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2234"><span>We won’t make it in time even if we deploy the Rank B equivalent warriors’ regiments and move out without any sleep or rest.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2235"><span>I want to have all of my subordinates take part in this fight, but by the time we arrive at the battlefield, the people from the Beast Kingdom would likely have already been slaughtered….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2236"><span>Would Clayman awaken if everyone is massacred?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2237"><span>《Answer. Despite the lack of efficiency, it will grant him a large amount of souls. Clayman’s rate of success in awakening——Seventy-eight percent. Additionally, his chances of success would increase if he has obtained the required amount of souls within a shorter time-span.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2238"><span>This is becoming a really difficult situation, I must stop him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2239"><span>It’s not even for the citizens of the Beast Kingdom whom I’ve never met, but for myself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2240"><span>I’ve never met those citizens, yet they were willing to forge a friendship between our nations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2241"><span>Trust is more valuable than gold, and kindness should be repaid with kindness. That’s why I won’t go easy on my interventions here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2242"><span>「Benimaru, go and stop them.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2243"><span>I assigned him an extremely challenging task, yet he only responds with a smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2244"><span>「Aye, I’ll do just that——No, it would be my pleasure to carry out your orders!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2245"><span>Benimaru. He is pretty obedient by heart.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2246"><span>He often goes back to his original tone whenever he gets excited.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2247"><span>But he believes that there is a difference between his professional and private life, so he is always very respectful to me in front of others……..but you don’t have to treat our current meeting as that important.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2248"><span>It’s indeed unpleasant to be looked down upon, and I understand you are doing so to prevent that from happening, but….. In this country, I doubt there is anyone who looks down on me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2249"><span>It’s like, performing better than your senior would probably result in an awkward relationship.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2250"><span>People realize this type of thing when they enter society.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2251"><span>That’s why I decided to steel my heart and give Benimaru the order as his superior.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2252"><span>「Hmm. As such, the defence battle of the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania is officially commencing. Let’s talk about how to win the battle with Benimaru acting as the key player.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2253"><span>「「「Understood!」」」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2254"><span>Everyone bows. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2255"><span>Even the three Beastketeers joined in. It seems I did sound quite imposing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2256"><span>This Clayman is far more cunning than I expected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2257"><span>Perhaps the Walpurgis Banquet three days later is also part of his plan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2258"><span>He is probably planning to slaughter the people of the Beast Kingdom before any other Demon Lords intervene and report it afterward.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2259"><span>It will take some time to unite the local combatants, and if things continue as it is, the warrior groups would be defeated one by one even with only a futile resistance.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2260"><span>And what would follow would likely be the massacre of the residents who are incapable of fighting back…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2261"><span>Since we’ve decided to stop this, everyone was eager to voice their opinions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2262"><span>Everyone wants to gather forces and head out immediately but no one spoke up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2263"><span>Everyone here knows the importance of information gathering.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2264"><span>The reason why I’ve announced my intentions of taking down Clayman but took no immediate action is because I’ve been waiting for Souei to report back. In addition, our soldiers are currently switching gears and gathering resources at the town plaza.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2265"><span>Kaijin, Garm and Doldo are using their craftsmanship to help create new weapons and armor for them in preparation for war.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2266"><span>So there is no need to rush.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2267"><span>We need to know where our enemies are, the structure of their army, their number, as well as their intent.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2268"><span>We won’t make much of anything by simply marching in blindly without any knowledge on these matters.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2269"><span>Our discussion will soon be concluded for a while.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2270"><span>「We’ve confirmed their forces to be there. We will definitely win if we are to make it in time. But the problem lies in how we’re going to get there. We have to buy some time or we won’t make it as things stand right now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2271"><span>「How about we first send in the Goblin Riders and Gabiru’s forces to distract them for a while?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2272"><span>「No, it would be pointless. I’ve sent men to investigate the geography of the Beast Kingdom. It mostly consists of plains and small hills. It’s not a great place for ambush tactics. It may be more effective to make an aerial assault, but a mere hundred soldier assault would amount to nothing.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2273"><span>Benimaru regained his calm demeanor.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2274"><span>If we are to lay an ambush, the orchards near the bank of the big river would be a good place. But the many hills there that are beneficial for water drainage make it too eye-catching, so the geography is also unsuitable for having our troops perform an ambush attack. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2275"><span>Hakurou’s suggestion got rejected. So far Benimaru is making the correct calls. I heard <span data-term="Suphia" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> whisper: 「What in the world, when did he investigate our nation’s geography…..」 I’m curious about that as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2276"><span>It’s likely that he sent someone to do the investigation when he was acting as the head of the diplomatic team. Should I see this as him being overly cautious or reliable in work…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2277"><span>Suphia doesn’t seem to be holding a grudge against it, so I’ll just pretend I didn’t hear that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2278"><span>「There are only four hundred Beastmen troops that are specialized in speed.

If the situation worsens, I would call him back. But I wish to resolve this situation with the seven people in total including myself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2292"><span>Even though I could take on the army by myself, showing off in battle is a big taboo.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2293"><span>Especially since Shuna is not good at face-to-face combat.

As long as we are able to buy more time, we can prevent casualties. Wouldn’t it be great if I can just somehow use teleportation magic to transport them there——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2295"><span>I mumbled to myself as a joke.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2296"><span>If we can use magic to teleport our troops there, it would resolve the issue immediately. But even with my 「Dimension Manipulation」, it is impossible to transport a thousand-man army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2297"><span>However——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2298"><span>《Answer. Teleportation magic can transport goods at relatively low cost. It can directly connect different dimensions to the coordinates of the teleportation location. This would induce a large amount of magicules to surround the area, unsuitable for transportation of organic matter. However, by using 「Barrier」 to protect their bodies, it will mitigate the effects during teleportation. This is the principle of teleportation magic—— 》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2299"><span>Hmmm……..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2300"><span>So that’s the difference between teleportation and </span><span>transference</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="I think there could be a better word in this context" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>……..The key difference is to have additional magical protection applied to the objects being teleported, so it uses more magicules.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2301"><span>Ehh? That would mean…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2302"><span>《——In other words, for Majins or </span><span>monster</span><span>s who possess resistance towards magicules or if they are able to cast 「Barrier」 on their own, teleportation would become feasible for them. Alternatively, one can also cast the complete teleportation technique that invokes protection on the target》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2303"><span>That would mean as long as the target possess strength to withstand a large amount of magicule exposure, it can then pass through the special transportation dimension. This seems to be the same principle as the extra skill 「Dimensional Transportation」. I’ve got to keep an eye on this matter.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2304"><span>To be more clear, it would be possible to even teleport people if the subjects being teleported are completely protected beforehand. No no no, that would be the actual way to use transportation magic, but even if that’s the case, wouldn’t it still cost a lot of magicules? Plus there isn’t enough time for me to modify it to the point of being able to accommodate an army of over ten-thousand of soldiers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2305"><span>《Answer: The magic has been developed. Additionally, with the combined use of 「Dimensional Manipulation」, its magicule cost has been successfully reduced.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2306"><span>Wow, this is really impressive!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2307"><span>What’s with this sudden growth of Raphael-sama?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2308"><span>It has already developed magic and skills for me even before I requested them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2309"><span>Speaking of which, after I awakened as a Demon Lord, my skills have all evolved dramatically and I’ve not been able to familiarize myself with them at all.

After all even with his 「Clone」 active, he still had to act cautiously. It will be bad if the enemy got hold of our movement if we just end up moving into a trap.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2372"><span>The enemy’s base of operations may be hidden behind this fog bank, so knowing this is enough.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2373"><span>「How about we send out a few people to investigate their base using the weak points in enemy force?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2374"><span>「But, wouldn’t Clayman be attending Walpurgis Banquet? There’s a chance we might miss him.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2375"><span>Benimaru expresses his view though Shuna rejects it calmly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2376"><span>Benimaru made an awkward expression in response.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2377"><span>「It makes sense. In addition, if we underestimate the enemy force, our vanguard would get overwhelmed instead resulting in their pull back. This would render our efforts rather meaningless. I think Benimaru-sama should focus on leading the army instead.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2378"><span>Hakurou delivered the final blow and ended the conversation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2379"><span>「Are there any other ideas?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2380"><span>Anyhow, let’s hear about everyone else’s ideas.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2381"><span>Yes! Shion begins to raise her hand energetically while looking at me...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2382"><span>And I gave her permission to speak up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2383"><span>「How about we attack the site of Walpurgis Banquet directly and kill off not only Clayman, but any other Demon Lords who dare to disagree with us?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2384"><span>She says with sparkling eyes (:ShionSparklings: (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧).</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2385"><span>It’s my fault for asking for advice from an idiot.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2386"><span>The annoyance is almost causing veins to emerge on my temple, but I’ve endured it. This seemed to have happened before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2387"><span>「Shion, how are you going to do that? I mean, can’t you provide some more practical ideas?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2388"><span>Killing Clayman alone is tough enough as it is, how are we supposed to fight all the other Demon Lords together?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2389"><span>At the very least we should take them down individually——I scolded Shion strictly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2390"><span>With that being said, she loses all her spirit and looks very down.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2391"><span>There’s really no helping with her, guess I’ll play along a little.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2392"><span>So I went on a tangent (to praise her), after all I still adore Shion a fair bit</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2393"><span>「But, maybe rushing in may actually be a good suggestion.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2394"><span>Shion then raises her face with excitement written all over her face.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2395"><span>What a realist approach.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2396"><span>「I’m just asking, Ramiris, but is it possible for me to participate?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2397"><span>I asked Ramiris who’s more experienced with it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2398"><span>「Eh? Do you want to participate, Rimuru?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2399"><span>「No, it’s just for reference. Since Clayman is going to participate in the meeting, so if I take the initiative, it might make things more interesting.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2400"><span>Since I’ve already been targeted, striking first may actually be a good idea.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2401"><span>Preemptively striking is tactically basic, but Clayman most definitely would be surprised with me showing up to where he would least expect me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2402"><span>It might not be a good idea to use violence in a meeting, but I’d like to try it first.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2403"><span>「Hmm——It should be fine. However, you can only bring at most two people as companions!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2404"><span>Bringing a bunch of subordinates would only cause unnecessary trouble, so I can’t take too many fo them with me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2405"><span>I’ve heard story of some newly enrolled Demon Lord that tried to be imposing and brought hundreds of his close subordinates to the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2406"><span>This action uncanningly enraged a Demon Lord who’s been mad at (her) territory having been wiped out at the time.</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Ruminas after Veldora wiped out her kingdom." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2407"><span>That Demon Lord’s anger probably could have been vented on anyone. </span><span>And so he ended up kil</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="Das, please see what this line actually was in the source" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_2408"><span>After that incident, the meeting forbids Majins with insufficient strength to participate. And among the Demon Lords, they may only take two companions along.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2409"><span>But this would also mean that there has been that type of disputes in the past. So it should be fine for me to go as someone looking for trouble.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2410"><span>Barging in and accusing Clayaman directly, I should seriously consider this idea.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2411"><span>「What do you think? Wouldn’t my participation in it be very interesting?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2412"><span>「Kufufufufu, this proposal is wonderful. Would you allow me to accompany you——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2413"><span>「Bastard, Diablo! I will be the one to accompany Rimuru-Sama. I won’t let you have him!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2414"><span>And the two of them begin to argue again. (Diablo and Shion)</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2415"><span>It would be suicide bringing these two along, but I wasn’t planning to have the two of them in the same place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2416"><span>And just as this idea was raised——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2417"><span>「——Since we will eventually fight against all the Demon Lords anyways, let’s just kill them all. After all, shouldn’t it be enough to just have Rimuru-sama as the only Demon Lord?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2418"><span>And even Diablo begins to spout out nonsense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2419"><span>Shion agrees completely and begins to nod her head excitedly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2420"><span>「That’s right! And here I thought you are an idiot. That’s some very profound views from a newbie! I didn’t expect you to give voice to all my thoughts!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2421"><span>Should I see them as sharing a tacit relationship or being on bad term?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2422"><span>If I have to pick someone, I think Shion is more brain dead, but…... both of them seem equally bent on beating up the other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2423"><span>How did things end up like this?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2424"><span>Looking around, I find several people at the scene agreeing with their views.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2425"><span>Some people are being cautious, while some are highly ecstatic, even giving off a killing intent.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2426"><span>For some reason, the number of warmongers among us has only increased.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2427"><span>And that method is way too reckless.

He seems confident enough but I hope he won’t suffer a Waterloo if he underestimates his enemies.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2431"><span>With some regrets and a mix of joy in being assigned a mission by me, Diablo made a mixed expression.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2432"><span>「But, wouldn’t it be too dangerous still?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2433"><span>Shuna’s tone gives off a sense of worry.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2434"><span>Indeed, these are the opinion we hold.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2435"><span>「That’s right. Moreover wouldn’t it be more efficient to try to attack Clayman’s base when he’s not there? Hence there’s no reason to attend the Walpurgis 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2436"><span>Geld speaks up cautiously, seemingly agreeing with Shuna’s views.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2437"><span>It seems to be the more viable tactic, avoiding risk and fight winnable battle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2438"><span>Geld is also quite eager to fight, but he is not as reckless. It’s very delightful to hear so many opinions under much consideration. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2439"><span>But there are other reasons as to why I’m considering attending the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2440"><span>Something is concerning me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2441"><span>「No, Rimuru-sama is worrying about the intent of Demon Lord Milim-sama. It is unthinkable that Milim-sama would betray us, so she’s most likely being manipulated by Clayman.

So attending the Walpurgis Banquet to find out the truth behind it wouldn’t be such a bad idea.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2442"><span>「Indeed. Milim-sama being one of people who initiated the Banquet is also concerning. Hence there must be some sort of conspiracy behind it, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2443"><span>Surprisingly, Benimaru’s comment aligns perfectly with my thoughts while Souei also points out my concerns.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2444"><span>Sasuga Benimaru and Souei. They have the same views as me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2445"><span>「Yeah, Milim following Clayman’s every orders, there’s no way that that would have happened in this world. Because Milim is way too stubborn!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2446"><span>Do you have any right to criticise her, Ramiris? That thought popped into my head, but she and I shared the same view.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2447"><span>「Milim-sama would never betray Rimuru-sama. Even though this is just my hunch, but I still pretty sure that I’m right.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2448"><span>Shion asserts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2449"><span>Right, we don’t have any proof either…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2450"><span>But I also dont think that she’ll betray us.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2451"><span>「<span data-term="Wisdom King Raphael" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」 also reached the same conclusion even though it couldn’t be hundred-percent sure without sufficient information to back up this claim, there’s no way such a thing would happen without a drastic change in situation. I decided to have faith in Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2452"><span>But even if that’s the case, I can’t just leave it this way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2453"><span>「I also agree with all of your points and I don’t think Milim would betray me. Therefore, something must have happened. As Ramiris said, let’s assume Clayman isn’t the culprit here, but I still think it is highly likely that he has been the puppet master behind all of these events thus far. So I’ll take Benimaru’s advice and participate in the Walpurgis Banquet to investigate how things were there…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2454"><span>Something would definitely happen in between the session.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2455"><span>In the worst case scenario, Milim may attack us by the end of Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2456"><span>That is what concerns me the most, and the reason why I think it’s still dangerous even if we just leave it as it is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2457"><span>Fighting Clayman alone won’t really be a problem, however, the goal is to avoid engagement with Milim in any form of confrontation as much as possible.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2458"><span>「See? I told you I’m right! Indeed, indeed, everything has been expected by the famed detective Ramiris. If that’s the case, we just have to go and beat the crap out of Clayman!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2459"><span>And I thought I was successful in leading the topic and concluded the most dangerous conversation——yet now Ramiris begins shouting some bizzare nonsense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2460"><span>「Also, what even is the deal here? Why are there so many powerful Majins just running around here? You should just let Beretta be my servant since you have so many strong subordinates already!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2461"><span>And she then dared to say that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2462"><span>Ramiris sure is being quite outrageous. She’s only gotten more bold after discovering the strength of my companions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2463"><span>But I didn’t plan on giving Beretta up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2464"><span>But more importantly, we need to consider what Beretta wants in this situation, not just what Ramiris wants.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2465"><span>Moreover, some of my subordinates seem to share the same sentiments with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2466"><span>「I see, that sounds reasonable. Very well, I shall go kill him. I shall return shortly——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2467"><span>「Eh, hold on hold on, calm down now Shion. Let’s prepare first before going, you too, Benimaru and Souei!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2468"><span>Seriously,</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2469"><span>The situation turned into something of a mess like this as soon as I decided to participate in the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2470"><span>Benimaru have to engage with Clayman’s army, same goes for Souei.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2471"><span>As the military meeting continues, I need to assess cautiously about the candidates as to who will be my two companions to the Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2472"><span>So, the candidates I’m looking for are…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2473"><span>I suddenly felt the pressure from a sharp stare coming from behind my back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2474"><span>You can figure it out with your joint that it’s Shion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2475"><span>She would probably go crazy if I didn’t take her with me. It seems that it’s becoming increasingly hard for Benimaru to keep her in check, so I guess I’d have to take care of this mess.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2476"><span>What’s more, Shion almost died by Clayman’s ploy——or should I say that she was literally killed over it——hence, this may be a great chance for revenge, that’s why I wish to bring her along.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2477"><span>Just like that, Shion has been selected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2478"><span>The other one is rather hard to choose, but Ranga seems like a good candidate.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2479"><span>I was planning to have him hide in my shadow, but it will be problematic if the location has some special barrier similar to 「Holy Purification Barrier」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2480"><span>I found out that Ranga has been listening in all this time anticipating to join, so I suppose I should take Ranga too.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2481"><span>He is a competent bodyguard after all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2482"><span>Just like that, I made my decision to bring Shion and Ranga with me. Both of whom have the ability of 「Dimensional Transportation」which is one of my reason for bringing them since they can easily escape with me if anything happens.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2483"><span>As long as they’ve experienced the newly made barrier inspired by 「Holy Purification Barrier」, they should have a good chance of escaping even in the worst case scenario.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2484"><span>The three of us should move out together and head straight to the Walpurgis Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2485"><span>If Milim is indeed being unfortunately controlled, the next thing being destroyed would most likely be this town. That is a possibility that I need to prevent no matter the cost.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2486"><span>I will not let this town suffer once again.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2487"><span>「Let’s participate then. I’ll bring Shion and Ranga along. Ramiris, could you help convey the message that I wish to participate?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2488"><span>「Hmm, I understand!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2489"><span>Ramiris answers without hesitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2490"><span>And then she seems to have initiated a certain Demon Lord special communication line to inform the rest of the Demon Lords about my participation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2491"><span>It seems like some sort of high level skill that could communicate through the interference of space.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2492"><span>I observe her looking impressed for a while, and at the moment, someone walks towards me while laughing loudly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2493"><span>It’s Veldora. It seems that he’s finished with his manga and has been listening to our conversation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2494"><span>「Gahahahaha! Yes, you are finally taking things seriously! Although you're not being a good friend, RImuru, bring me along as well! You don’t have to worry about those Demon Lords at all with my company!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2495"><span>He makes such proud statement in full confidence.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2496"><span>Speaking of that, I’ve completely forgotten about the fact that he’s here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2497"><span>But, I don’t plan to bring Veldora along.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2498"><span>「Oh well, don’t get ahead of yourself now, Veldora. I hope you can stay in the town and focus on defense.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2499"><span>「Nani! Wasn’t I supposed to be going along too? Take my words, I won’t lose to those Demon Lords at all!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2500"><span>With my words, Veldora received a huge surprise, probably not expecting that I would say this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2501"><span>Defending this town is also an important mission, perhaps the most important task.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2502"><span>We are marching all of our forces to take a final stand against Clayman. There will only be the police force led by Rigur present back here, whose numbers are pretty small, as well as Shion’s subordinates.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2503"><span>The strategy is based on the precondition that Veldora remained here to defend the town.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2504"><span>If the Western Saints Church is to send out invasion force, Veldora alone should be able to handle them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2505"><span>「——That’s how it is, so I hope you can stay back for the defense.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2506"><span>「Uhh…….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2507"><span>He seems unable to accept it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2508"><span>It can’t be helped, I guess I’ll tell him the real reason——I was just about to speak up before Ramiris, who finished the communication, begins to shout.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2509"><span>「Hey, Rimuru! They’ve approved your participation, but aren’t you being too mean here? It will be okay if I have master to participate as my companion (underling). It’s safer for me as well!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2510"><span>Well, with that being said it does sound reasonable.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2511"><span>But from my perspective, Ramiris’ intention is crystal clear. She’s trying to bring Veldora and Beretta there to brag.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2512"><span>I think Veldora has also seen through her——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2513"><span>「......huh, no? I don’t want to go as you bodyguard at all.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2514"><span>He rejects without hesitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2515"><span>「AWH REALLY——！EHHHH how could this….. You are so cruel, master!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2516"><span>I mean, what’s with this master thing about Veldora….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2517"><span>Ramiris and Veldora seemed to have grown a friendship because of manga.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2518"><span>It’s certain that the two have good relationship, but in terms of their power, it seems Ramiris is one-sidedly trying to get on good term with Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2519"><span>Doesn’t matter, it’s a good thing anyway.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2520"><span>Our focus should be us participating in the Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2521"><span>For some of the Demon Lords, they may find it more troublesome to go around human towns. But that’s just to my advantage.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2522"><span>「Veldora, we’ve been intentionally releasing fake news about you. You should know about that from the meeting we just finished.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2523"><span>It could have been a way to have him follow Ramiris as a servant. But honestly, I think it would lower the guards of the other Demon Lords to make them think that Veldora didn't follow along.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2524"><span>「Hmm, Hmmhmm, of course I know.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2525"><span>Ah, it seems he doesn’t know.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2526"><span>And he is pretending that he paid attention to the meeting. He must have gotten addicted to reading manga.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2527"><span>However, it’s then much easier now to make up stories for him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2528"><span>「Besides, Clayman must be thinking that the Majin Rimuru is a bluffing scum who relies on Veldora’s name——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2529"><span>「What! That bastard Clayman, we’ll see about it!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2530"><span>「He... this ignorant bug, I shall go myself to personally take him out.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2531"><span>「Ahhh, calm down you guys. Rimuru-sama is just giving an example.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2532"><span>I was halfway through my sentence before Shion and Diablo started acting all angry in my stead.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2533"><span>You guys really can’t keep your cool now, can you?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2534"><span>Benimaru was a bit mad for a moment, but since the other two spoke first, he got to regain his composure.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2535"><span>「Don’t get riled up now, Benimaru’s right, that was just an example. Anyway, if we bring Veldora to the meeting and cause them to be on alert, wouldn’t it be pointless? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2536"><span>「Oh, so it’s like that.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2537"><span>「I understand now, sasuga Rimuru-sama!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2538"><span>「Gufufufufu, anyone who dares to insult Rimuru-sama is unforgivable. I wanted to exterminate him by my own hands, but perhaps I shall allow Shion senpai perform the act instead.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2539"><span>「So you want to lead the opponent into lowering their guard in order to drive the negotiation in our favour, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2540"><span>Veldora who realizes my point nod and says so while Shion praises without using her brain.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2541"><span>Diablo is again making some dangerous statement, but he does think the best candidate to take down Clayman in this case is Shion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2542"><span>Benimaru looks quite happy having read my thought.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2543"><span>「But, shouldn’t we try to avoid danger?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2544"><span>Shuna asks me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2545"><span>Her comment seems to have resonated with others as Geld and Gabiru nods in agreement.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2546"><span>「Even if you are considered by the enemies as an individual to be cautious of, should you not perhaps focus on your personal safety?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2547"><span>Says Hakurou to me with Souei agreeing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2548"><span>Indeed, I can see where everyone’s worries is coming from.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2549"><span>With that being said, I’ve also assessed that part.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2550"><span>「It’s alright. I can use my skill 『Storm Dragon Summon』 to call out Veldora at any time. That wouldn’t count as a companion to the meeting, right? That’s why, since I can seek help at any point I wish, I hope you will defend the town quietly before that happens. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2551"><span>I said so proudly with a face as if saying 「How about that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2552"><span>My companions all seemed very impressed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2553"><span>「GA—————HAHAHA! So I am actually the Hero for the finale.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2554"><span>Veldora is feeling good about himself again.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2555"><span>As long as you don’t object, I won’t say a thing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2556"><span>「That’s so cunning….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2557"><span>Ramiris pouts by herself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2558"><span>「Baka, Ramiris. You should praise me for being so smart.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2559"><span>Ramiris is still upset while Veldora whispers to himself 「So that’s the case.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2560"><span>I take the chance to bring up one more thing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2561"><span>「Besides, now you’ve got an extra spot for a companion.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2562"><span>Upon hearing this, the Ramiris’ eyes along with the rest of my companions begin to glow.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2563"><span>「You know me too well, Rimuru! Very well, who are you sending in as my servant?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2564"><span>Ramiris seems satisfied with her servant number increased to two. Given how she looks now, she’s really just trying to show off to other Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2565"><span>Anyhow, it’s alright as long as she accepts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2566"><span>One more spot…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2567"><span>I realize that everyone who hasn’t been selected has been looking at me nervously, however, this servant must be strong enough.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2568"><span>If I am being honest, Benimaru is the best choice, but the war can’t be fought while I am not present, so Benimaru has to make up for it. Thus I have to select someone else.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2569"><span>——Which would mean——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2570"><span>「Sorry to keep everyone waiting, I choose Haku——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2571"><span>「Please hold on a second!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2572"><span>Someone interrupted me as I was halfway through nominating Hakurou. It was the woman standing behind Ramiris——Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2573"><span>「Rimuru-sama, please allow me to take this mission no matter what——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2574"><span>「Treyni, what a stubborn child!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2575"><span>Ramiris also looks delighted with her eyes soaking in tears.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2576"><span>It can’t be helped then, I’ll choose her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2577"><span>「Fine. Then we will go on with Treyni-san’s aid.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2578"><span>I announce so, agreeing to the participation of Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2579"><span>As such, the members participating the Walpurgis Banquet are settled.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2580"><span>My companions are Shion and Ranga.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2581"><span>While Ramiris’ companions are Beretta and Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2582"><span>And our trump card is summoning Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2583"><span>It’s my luck that the Demon Lords have approved my participation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2584"><span>I may even meet Leon Cromwell, one of the Demon Lord whom I have grudges against.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2585"><span>But, this time I’ll first be checking out just what kind of a person he really is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2586"><span>I still carry and am unable to deal with Shizu-san’s dying wish and I cannot just leave it like that, but this time my target is Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2587"><span>The riot caused by Orc Lord is still fresh in my memory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2588"><span>As well as the ordeal with <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2589"><span>Most importantly, I am worried about MIlim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2590"><span>If we aren’t careful, we would end up fighting Milim.

Don’t underestimate us!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2627"><span>A bold, strong man shouts angrily.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2628"><span>This is the city for people who worship the dragon</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Das: I will refer them as Worshippers of Dragons from here on" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>. This man is the high priest of the temple in the city.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2629"><span>His name is Midley. He is the leader of those who worship Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2630"><span>「But Midley-sama, if we don’t follow orders now, we’ll really suffer . Didn’t that commander named Yamza had a written order from Milim-sama herself?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2631"><span>A servant hissing with a smile says to him.</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="Das can you check? Why would he &quot;smile&quot;?" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_2632"><span>His name is Hermes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2633"><span>He is the close servant and assistant to high priest Midley, being a member of the priest group.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2634"><span>He’s always rather carefree and casual, so he may get easily categorized as the pretentious type of person.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2635"><span>Midley shouts out furiously in response, seemingly pissed off by Hermes’ attitude.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2636"><span>「Shut up Hermes. I don’t need you to tell me what I already know too well!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2637"><span>Hermes, being scolded harshly and seeing Midley so worked up, feels internally rather helpless in return.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2638"><span>That being said, he can relate to why Midley has become so enraged.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2639"><span>The reason is that the Majin group that was loitering within their borders since yesterday suddenly invaded this place——The Lost City of Dragon, and somehow built a camp here as if it is their own home.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2640"><span>They appear to be working for Demon Lord Clayman, and are marching towards Demon Lord <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s territory to investigate his violation of the pact.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2641"><span>They couldn’t have said no, even if they wanted to.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2642"><span>Even though Midley is still furious, they genuinely can’t do anything about their situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2643"><span>And there is also a reason for that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2644"><span>It also happens that the person who decimated the Beast Kingdom Yuurazania of Demon Lord <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is also the one they worship, Demon Lord Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2645"><span>Since it’s related to their master, naturally they had to facilitate the gathering of evidence by Clayman’s men. Or rather, if they couldn’t find any evidence, it would only cause disadvantages for Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2646"><span>But Milim probably won’t give a damn about it. It has however caused a big headache for people such as Hermes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2647"><span>「For real though, Milim-sama sure is troubling…….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2648"><span>Her stubbornness is truly something else. They deeply hope that Milim-sama can change a bit——</span><span>even if it’s really just a little</span><span>——to at least think for them. Hermes thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2649"><span>「That would be most disrespectful, Hermes! You cannot doubt Milim-sama’s actions.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2650"><span>「No, you are right but…….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2651"><span>It’s all because you spoiled her so much that I’m getting more and more work every day.</span><span>&nbsp;Hermes thinks to himself. But he can’t say that since it will only enrage Midley more.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2652"><span>But we are in some serious trouble this time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2653"><span>He complains to himself and starts recalling the suffering they have been through.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2654"><span>Even though they are aware that the army would be requesting to pass through the land, their attitudes are decidedly arrogant in a way that really leaves a bad taste in the residents’ mouths.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2655"><span>The army didn’t pay any recognition to the Worshipers of Dragon at all and simply felt that their assistance is only natural at the time. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2656"><span>Their request is no different from orders.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2657"><span>The City of Lost Dragon where the Worshipers of Dragon reside has a population of less than a hundred thousand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2658"><span>It does not contain any functions of a nation. The citizens help each other out and live together.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2659"><span>They were able to live peacefully under the protection of Demon Lord Milim without much military power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2660"><span>At least that’s what those who are aware of this country usually think.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2661"><span>However, this understanding is only 50% correct.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2662"><span>Indeed, they don’t possess much political clout.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2663"><span>To be specific, everyone contributes their earnings to the central temple for the high priest to redistribute equally. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2664"><span>Normally, one would think there will be lazy people that will undermine the system, but in reality it’s different. The hard-working and the lazy get basic financial compensation. But apart from that, the hard-working people get to enjoy an additional bonus.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2665"><span>If we compare it to modern-day Japan, it will be the system where everyone has the basic welfare to ensure one’s living.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2666"><span>The issue with this system lies mainly on those who decide on the amount of compensation the people are given. However…. Milim has allowed Midley to handle everything in the area.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2667"><span>This is why he holds such authority that may even determine life or death. However, Midley has never abused it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2668"><span>The reason for this is also simple: the assistant priest of Midley has the rights to abolish him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2669"><span>If he ever becomes tyrannical and exploits his authority for his own desires, he will lose all of his status. Midley knows this very well and thats why he never became a tyrant.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2670"><span>But in truth, MIlim has already taken the seat of a legitimate tyrant, so no one dares to imitate her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2671"><span>Due to the reasons above , the thousands of worshippers are surprisingly united.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2672"><span>Besides that, there is another reason.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2673"><span>The belief held by the outside world that these people lack combat abilities…… is a complete misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2674"><span>For some reason, the worshippers of Dragon are all individually equipped with strong physical capabilities.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2675"><span>Apart from their unity and discipline, an adult worshipper’s power is close to Rank C.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2676"><span>The fact that they are all pacifistic is not nearly as remarkable when acknowledging that they are, in fact, a difficult organization to handle that favours martial strength. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2677"><span>The priests possess even greater power than the rest. The evidence is that there’s only around a hundred party members.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2678"><span>Every member is an elite and a force to be reckoned with. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2679"><span>Everyday they pray to Milim——in forms of combat training——As a result, their combat capabilities are extraordinary.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2680"><span>Among them, Midley and Hermes can even request Milim as their sparring partner—— that is how strong they both are. But even so, Clayman’s subordinates still looked down to them all, which genuinely pissed them off.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2681"><span>Moreover, there’s a bigger secret that they’ve kept.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2682"><span>Which is——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2683"><span>The day after that,</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2684"><span>Clayman’s subordinates took the worshippers’ food from their warehouse without permission.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2685"><span>Midley’s face is gradually bursting with his veins due to his anger, but he endured.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2686"><span>「By the way, why hasn’t Milim-sama returned?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2687"><span>Midley asks, mainly in order to distract himself from his fury. .</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2688"><span>「Only god would know, but why did you ask——?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2689"><span>Hermes makes a random response. They’ve repeated this Q&amp;A over a dozen times and the longer it goes, the more annoyed Hermes feels.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2690"><span>「We’ve prepared a great feast just for her……. Could Milim-sama be suffering of hunger at some place? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2691"><span>「N-No way.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2692"><span>Hermes asserts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2693"><span>He’s quite certain about the. Since the “great feast” Midley refers to is a large vegetable dish named 「The Platter of Nature’s Gifts」. It’s raw by the way. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2694"><span>Hermes secretly observed Milim’s expression when he’d dined with her when eating it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2695"><span>She had no expression on her face, nor any emotional response. All she did was chewing.</span></p><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image19.png" title="" height="810" width="563" class="line" id="line_2696"><p class="line" id="line_2697"><span>No way was that a great feast. She didn’t appear to enjoy it one bit; or rather she looked as if she was trying her hardest to endure.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2698"><span>Hermes is certain of it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2699"><span>When they’d served the roast meat, Milim had looked quite happy eating it, that was rather obvious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2700"><span>But then when Hermes proposed this to Midley 「We should serve her cooked meal before the vegetables. Milim-sama would be very happy to have it!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2701"><span>He got turned down with his suggestion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2702"><span>Midley believes the direct ingestion of the rich products of nature would be the best serving——And so, Hermes was unable to change Midley’s mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2703"><span>This is why Milim-sama seldomly comes here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2704"><span>Hermes really wants to speak his mind, but he’s in a disadvantageous position right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2705"><span>He has travelled through different countries and experienced delicious cuisines. In comparison, no other priests have had this kind of experience. Everyone believes the best food is always the natural ones. They will reject his proposal so long as they maintain this mindset. That’s why Hermes decided to give up on this matter.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2706"><span>「Is that so? That would be good then. But how dare that Clayman act all presumptuous and force MIlim-sama to write an order…... 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2707"><span>The handwriting is terrible——Correction, the handwriting on the order is uniquely intriguing, it’s definitely Milim’s writing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2708"><span>That’s why they’re forced to follow the order. But still, there’s a bottom line.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2709"><span>「Yeah, we had to comply because of Milim-sama’s order…….but now the third granary has also been emptied. That leaves seven left, we are gonna have a hard time until the next harvest…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2710"><span>「Damnit!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2711"><span>Midley’s veins bursts on his bald head like a hami melon. You can tell with one look just how much fury he holds.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2712"><span>Hermes, who happens across this scene, finds it quite funny. He can only note that Midley is somewhat mentally unstable.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2713"><span>And in that instant, the source of their anger enters their sights——Clayman army’s commander walking towards them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2714"><span>「*Smacks lips* ! Hermes, we need to endure for now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2715"><span>「Understood.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2716"><span>That’s my line——Hermes thinks as he answers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2717"><span>He hopes that guy will just pass them by, but unfortunately the man makes a beeline towards Hermes and the rest.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2718"><span>Both of them stop talking to wait for the man——Yamza, to approach them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2719"><span>Yamza is the commanding officer of Clayman’s army and it wouldn’t be a lie to say that he is Clayman’s right hand man.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2720"><span>He looks rather light for his medium build, and is the type of fighter who focuses on speed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2721"><span>Or rather, a swordsman. He is a top swordsman with swiftness beyond the wind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2722"><span>He is equipped with the specially crafted Magic Frost Sword, gifted by Clayman. It can cast the elemental-based magic 「Great Storm of Ice and Water」without chanting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2723"><span>The Magic Swordsman of Frost, Yamza——The A+ Majin who wields </span><span>both</span><span>&nbsp;sword and magic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2724"><span>「Hehe, how are you, Midley-dono? Thank you for your support with rations; it really helped a lot. After all, I have thirty-thousand people to take care of here. No small amount of food could suffice.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2725"><span>Yamza hangs a caring smile, yet such joyful expression is absent in his eyes. Instead, they are observing Midley’s reaction carefully.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2726"><span>He didn’t even bother to acknowledge Hermes’ presence with a glance. This is the usual attitudes for Majins who look down on human.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2727"><span>This truly makes him feel uncomfortable. But, Hermes has to endure under Midley’s order. There is no pointing arguing with Yamza anyway, so he will endure for now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2728"><span>「Ha-ha-ha. What an honor for us to assist you. However, we really aren’t able to continue this favor. If our people are to suffer famine, MIlim-sama would be very sad.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2729"><span>「What nonsense is this! That Demon Lord Milim acted on her and now my army has to clean up her mess. Besides, isn’t it only natural for you to maintain the friendship between our masters?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2730"><span>Yamza became furious with just two lines of response from Midley. No, his anger is an act. He’s trying to see Midley’s response to his pretended fury.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2731"><span>If Midley is to lose his temper and argues back, Yamza would exploit this matter and burn down the city. It is quite obvious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2732"><span>「Ah ah, my apology. I accidentally had some selfish thoughts. We’ll help you with everything we’ve got, so please don’t be generous with us and speak up your mind.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2733"><span>In order to quench Yamza’s anger, Midley bows his body and bow to him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2734"><span>Hermes feels immense respect towards Midley having witnessed this. After all, Yamza has already revealed his true intent yet Midley did not even show a sign of anger on his face.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2735"><span>He simply smiled and replied.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2736"><span>Impressive, sasuga Midley-sama. Now his head doesn’t look like a homi melon at all. If it’s me I’d lose my temper already.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2737"><span>Hermes thinks to himself, but then…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2738"><span>「Is that so? But I was expecting that. But since there is no issue for us to wipe out the Beast Kingdom alone, we want to gift you with the opportunity to assist us. Would it pose any problem if you are to handle the transportation of our resources?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2739"><span>Yamza gives off a evil smirk after finishing his words and caused Hermes to argue back unconsciously. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2740"><span>「W-wait a second! It’s enough that you rob our food, now you want to take out labor as well——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2741"><span>He didn’t intend to resist. He simply slipped his thought out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2742"><span>Immediately after, Hermes feels tremendous pain flowing from his left hand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2743"><span>「AHHHHH!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2744"><span>「Shut your mouth, human trash!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2745"><span>Yamza squeezes his eyes ruthlessly. His cold eyes meet with Hermes’ for the first time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2746"><span>Hermes bites his teeth hard and stares back at Yamza while holding onto his severed hand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2747"><span>「——Ho, aren’t you the rebel? Looks like you are begging me to finish you off.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2748"><span>Yamza gives off a cruel smile and points his blood-stained sword towards Hermes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2749"><span>You bastard, don’t get ahead of yourself——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2750"><span>Hermes wants to shout with fury, yet he was hit by a strong impact force as if he’s been crashed by a beast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2751"><span>It was from a kick.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2752"><span>Midley initiated a powerful kick against Hermes’ abdomen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2753"><span>「Haha, we are truly sorry for the continuous offense, Yamza-sama. I’ll scold this idiot myself and educate him better in the future. Please forgive him for my sake.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2754"><span>Midley bows and pleads towards Yamza.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2755"><span>「Huh. It’s so hard to look after moronic subordinates. I’ll let you off the hook this time. We are setting off tomorrow morning. All of you priest should go and prepare yourselves!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2756"><span>Thanks to Midley’s intervention was the situation salvaged and Yamza sheathed his sword. However, it came at a heavy price. The leaders that are the priest of the Worshippers of Dragons has been forced into conscription. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2757"><span>Yamza left with the line and walked away without a care.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2758"><span>They weren’t planning to conscript the worshippers to war, but only the priests who are capable of restoration magic. And because Hermes couldn't restrain himself, it went the way Yamza wanted.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2759"><span>When Yamza left, Midley begins to heal Hermes while sighing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2760"><span>「You idiot, didn’t I just tell you to stay quiet?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2761"><span>「Sorry, I couldn’t help myself and….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2762"><span>Hermes holds tight onto his severed hand as Midley applies treatment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2763"><span>WIth the effect of holy magic 「Healing Sickness」, Hermes’ hand is restored to its original shape. But he’s not feeling quite well after losing too much blood. But since Hermes would later apply 「Stamina Regeneration」on himself, it won’t be an issue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2764"><span>「It’s alright. At least the people won’t have to suffer for now at the cost of the Priest group. Speaking of which, that man——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2765"><span>The suppressed anger of his now write all over Midley’s face as he stares viciously towards the direction Yamza left.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2766"><span>「——he dares to harm the properties of Milim-sama.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2767"><span>He’s talking about Yamza cutting off Hermes’ hand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2768"><span>Midley expresses his anger towards such unforgivable violent acts, yet he’s acting oblivious towards kicking Hermes just now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2769"><span>Hold on a second, your iron kick was quite deadly too….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2770"><span>But all in all, Hermes knew Midley didn’t mean any harm so he won’t complain about it. After all, Midley is Milim’s follower, he’s just as simple-minded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2771"><span>In fact, not only Midley, it’s what the entire nation is like…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2772"><span>「Huh, that’s right, can I kill him?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2773"><span>「Idiot, you are no match for him.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2774"><span>The proposal is instantly rejected, but Midley has a point.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2775"><span>As Midley just said, Hermes has no chance against Yamza.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2776"><span>「You’re right I suppose. That sword is rather difficult to deal with, and the man seems to have concealed other secrets as well.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2777"><span>「Hmm, no wonder that asshole is Clayman’s right hand man. He won’t show his strength if not required. But a man should fight justly…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2778"><span>No, that sounds really stupid you know——Hermes thinks to himself. But his thought is not mainstream in this country at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2779"><span>He is forced to agree, then returned to finish his work. The sudden change of plan to set off tomorrow leaves a lot of business to pile up for him to deal with.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2780"><span>The morning of the other day soon follows——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2781"><span>The Walpurgis Banquet will be held two days later, Clayman’s army is again, commencing its invasion operation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2782"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2783"><span>The meeting is over and it’s the next day’s morning.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2784"><span>I didn’t get much sleep last night, so I’m feeling the drowsiness. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2785"><span>But that’s just mental tiredness, I’m in fact more lively as ever.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2786"><span>I don’t have to sleep, which makes things convenient for me during time like this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2787"><span>Souei contacted me after yesterday’s meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2788"><span>His real self came for the meeting but his clones made from 「Shadow Clone」 have been travelling in the border of the Beast Kingdom to help him collect intels.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2789"><span>Souei’s five subordinates including Souka have been quite active as well, helping us collecting many intelligences.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2790"><span>Clayman’s army that we’ve been on guard against has not made a move yet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2791"><span>They’ve been looking for appropriate locations to deploy our ary. A question arose however.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2792"><span>The Beast Kingdom residents seeking refuge have been spread across the place. In order to rescue them, we seem to run short on time whichever direction we decide to march towards. The attacking route taken by Clayman has put us in disadvantage.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2793"><span>《There is a solution. Transport the refugees to a specific location altogether.

I don’t really care about that point——no actually, this may sound pretty weird but their vitality seems to have increased——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2830"><span>Benimaru was able to update me on the condition of the residents as everyone else is moving in formation. Some people seem to have transform younger in appearance. Everyone is very grateful about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2831"><span>But they are all non-combatants. So they only need to watch over the town this time instead of the joining the march.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2832"><span>So, let’s talk about the main combat forces.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2833"><span>Some combatants have gained skills, and since every corp has their unique features, the skills they gained seem range all over the place as they were assigned them based on the features of their combat unit.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2834"><span>I’m really looking forward to seeing them in action.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2835"><span>And now let’s check on the veteran forces.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2836"><span>The Goblin riders unit is under the leadership of Captain Gobuta.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2837"><span>They are Hobgoblins who ride the star wolf race which requires a certain set of conditions to trigger the evolution.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2838"><span>Are they really Hobgoblins?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2839"><span>Their race is indeed Hobgoblin, but their nature doesn’t seem to fit under the race.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2840"><span>These guys seemed to have gained a rare skill, Extra Skill 「Unification」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2841"><span>This skill is not just a simple metaphor for the rider and its ride, but it’s in fact a real merger skill. In order words, once the skill 「Unification」is activated, they would become powerful fighter that runs at high speed on four legs. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2842"><span>Their combined strength after unification is approximately Rank A.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2843"><span>The ability is specialized in battling a single enemy, that’s why </span><span>its</span><span>&nbsp;combat rank does not reach Rank A. But with that being said, its combat ability is still outstanding. If several groups of its users fight together, they may stand a chance against a Rank A majin.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2844"><span>Since the goblin riders are good at teamwork.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2845"><span>They are most reliable in high speed communication and on top of that, have endured much harsh training. After all, they’ve been personally trained (fucked) by Hakurou.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2846"><span>One can imagine the horrifying sight of such a corp being mobilized in group of hundreds.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2847"><span>They are likely very different from the combat rank assigned by the humans, so I’m very much looking forward to the performance of these fighters.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2848"><span>And up next are Benimaru’s subordinates.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2849"><span>Since I’ve become the leader of Jura Forest, the combat capabilities of these </span><span>monster</span><span>s have increased drastically.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2850"><span>Especially the Ogre race that have around three hundred personals. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2851"><span>The ones with impressive fighting capabilities among them are all young lads who were born from the village that sought help from me initially. They seem to have been blessed with evolution due to their admiration for Benimaru and the others.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2852"><span>It’s really quite surprising.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2853"><span>Some of them joined in voluntarily, among them joined as named fighter already. Their strength can rival that of Lower Majin, which make them quite reliable fighters.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2854"><span>The wild, unintelligent ogre has already reached Rank B before they joined. And now they are all equipped well and have learnt skills.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2855"><span>No way they aren’t strong.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2856"><span>These people formed Benimaru’s personal bodyguards, named 「Kurenai」</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Red Flame Group" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_2857"><span>This is a combat group with individual strength up to Rank A-.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2858"><span>And now let’s see the constituents of the vanguards led by Benimaru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2859"><span>There are roughly four thousands hobgoblins who have all undergone intriguing evolution.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2860"><span>They’ve gained 「Flame Control」and 「Heat Change Resistance」, therefore turning into elemental fire.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2861"><span>A rather surprising change.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2862"><span>Their individual rank is B, the same as the special attack force that focuses on strong attack power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2863"><span>And since all of these hobgoblins have green skins, all of their names are related to green.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2864"><span>I can’t imagine anyone to name them with these names, I really hope he’d had a better vision for the future.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2865"><span>《Answer.

So annoying!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2868"><span>It’s really because I didn’t think that much in the past.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2869"><span>The evolution of </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;is truly amazing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2870"><span>And since the members are all named after the colour green, the corp’s name is also named the Green Corps.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2871"><span>Life is all about being simplistic~</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2872"><span>Since it was Benimaru’s subordinates, I wanted to use red as their but green is profound in its own way. The members all have fire attacks unlike the color of their skins.

The captains additionally the Extra Skill 「Earth Manipulation」 that enables them to manipulate soil at will.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2877"><span>These are the new skills Geld mentioned before. They seem to be very useful in the mass-production of trenches. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2878"><span>And everyone also gained Extra Skill 「Full-Body Fortification」that makes the corp structure to focus on defense capabilities. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2879"><span>Furthermore, they’ve inherited most of my resistance. Besides 「Physical Attack Resistance」, they also gained 「Pain/Corrosion/Electricity/Paralysis Resistance」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2880"><span>The complete version of the shield that I gifted to <span data-term="Cabal" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> once, the Charybdis Scale Shield has been crafted to achieve special grade in terms of quality and possess defense capability against Magic. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2881"><span>In other words, they can now resist both physical and magical attacks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2882"><span>I also genuinely considered helping them gain poison resistance with Shion’s cooking….

Garm has finished processing the final product so Kurobe could replicate them in large quantities. I really appreciate these professional craftsmen.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2884"><span>Now we are able to turn them into a strong corp with individual rank reaching B. If all of its members can special grade equipments, they would easily surpass the standards of a normal army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2885"><span>They can be said to be an overpowered corp of defensive force. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2886"><span>It has five thousand members in total.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2887"><span>And with more and more volunteers joining, the number continues to grow.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2888"><span>They would handle construction projects in daily lives and turn into a strong legion if encounter any emergency.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2889"><span>Who are capable of resisting all sorts of attack that can be said to be the legion of Iron Wall.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2890"><span>——The Yellow Corps, would be the official name of this legion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2891"><span>Behind them are the some hundred dragonoids led by Gabiru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2892"><span>The Dragonoids already possesses very high racial attributes. And it is natural that they are up to Rank A.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2893"><span>With my blessings, the blood of dragon has been awakened more thoroughly. They’ve gained the intrinsic skill of 「Dragon Warrior Conversion」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2894"><span>They also get to choose either 「Black Flame Fog」or 「Black Lightning Fog」, and thus gained an additional range attack ability.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2895"><span>Gabiru is able to use both skills, very impressive!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2896"><span>And so I’m only not sure about what 「Dragon Warrior Conversion」is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2897"><span>《Answer.

But I trust Gabiru and the rest would work hard on their own to figure out the skills themselves. There’s no point in gaining power without hardwork. Or at least that’s how I see it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2901"><span>Eh, so what about me?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2902"><span>I have the ultimate skill 「<span data-term="Wisdom King Raphael" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」. I’ll be fine against any challenge with the aid of Raphael.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2903"><span>Raphael is my power, so in some sense, it is the equivalent of me working very hard. That’s why it’s perfectly reasonable to say I’ve not slacked one bit in terms of effort.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2904"><span>And that would be it. I hope Gabiru-kun and his partners could learn to use that skill well before the next crisis strike! Even though it’s a bit irresponsible on my part, I still hope they would work hard on it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2905"><span>Just saying, but what a waste it is for these subordinates to serve Gabiru..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2906"><span>They are all able to fly, making their fog attack from the sky hard to defend against.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2907"><span>Their racial attributes granted tham many innate resistances.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2908"><span>They were born with hardened scale that’s hard as steel and equips chest piece crafted with magical steel. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2909"><span>Weaker attack, whether with sword or magic won’t be able to pierce through it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2910"><span>They have an overwhelming advantage already given their flying capability and now they also get the body of defense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2911"><span>They are the assault squad possessing the trinity of speed, attack and defense. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2912"><span>So I’ve officially named them 「Hiryuu」</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Kanji translates to “Flying Dragon Group”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_2913"><span>They only have around hundred members, yet they are the strongest troop in our nation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2914"><span>The ones standing in the last row are the newly appointed troops.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2915"><span>These troops are my personal bodyguards.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2916"><span>And the one leading them is Shion. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_2917"><span>Structurally, it consists around a hundred members who were all previously resurrected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2918"><span>Some of them used to be children and they were able to age quickly to their adolescence.

Since Clayman’s target is the citizens of the Beast Kingdom, active retreats would definitely be effective, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2972"><span>Benimaru responds so with a smile that bears cunningness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2973"><span>Hmm, I also think it’s a good method. There is no need for them to clash head on and results in casualty.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_2974"><span>「Yes. I’ve discussed with Benimaru-san.

It seems I’ve successfully sent everyone away.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3018"><span>By the way, I got super scared initiating this for the first time last night.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3019"><span>After all, it shone such a bright light at midnight. It got me all spooked worrying it might have been spotted by Clayman’s army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3020"><span>After which I used smoke screening magic to cover up the light of the magic circle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3021"><span>Everything has a chance to fail, so I should never get careless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3022"><span>This time there is no need to hide the light, so I get to witness the spectacle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3023"><span>「Sasuga Rimuru-sama, what a beautiful spell!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3024"><span>「Indeed, its sight alone had me mesmerized!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3025"><span>Diablo begins to praise me with Shion, unwilling to miss out, starting to flatter me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3026"><span>Diablo seems to like magic a lot.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3027"><span>Perhaps we will discuss more about magic after the dust is settled with the issue at hand.

And also have them spread the news in all the villages to let the rumor spread out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3044"><span>The reason behind is very obvious, to let Clayman get hold of it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3045"><span>I really hope this news reach him soon, I thought so as I sent them out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3046"><span>Diablo told me: 「Don’t worry, I’ll be right back.」How low are you looking down on <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom? That actually caused me to worry about him. But I’ll leave it to him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3047"><span>Everyone would encounter failure at some point, it won’t be late to consider things when it happens.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3048"><span>After that, Gazel also returned to Dwargon. His ministers seem to have be furious so he went back in panic……Something must have gone wrong with his body double. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3049"><span>You could imagine that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3050"><span>I swear not to follow his footstep. So I need to plan everything perfectly</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3051"><span>With that thought circling in my mind, I saw Gazel off.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3052"><span>Another day passed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3053"><span>According to the message sent by Benimaru, they were successfully teleported to their destination.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3054"><span>However, this doesn’t mean everything would be smooth-sailing onward.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3055"><span>The thirty-thousand men army as well as the refugee were very restricted in terms of movement. Even if they are all strong beastmen unlike humans and the arrival time to the destination won’t be prolonged for long, still….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3056"><span>No need to worry, I’ve already planned out solutions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3057"><span>「Just like that, I’ve prepared the area for reception, so we can teleport the non-combatants back to the town in Tempest Federation. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3058"><span>I pat on Benimaru’s shoulder as I finish my sentence.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3059"><span>「Oh yeah….. You can do that….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3060"><span>Benimaru gives a look that says 「Why didn’t I realize that earlier」 and sighs.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3061"><span>No no no, this type of teleportation spell would consume a lot of my magicules. And the more people there are the more magicules it costs.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3062"><span>I didn’t have much strength left after teleporting the twenty thousand people yesterday. I can’t spam the spell too much, so it hasn't been a waste of time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3063"><span>Besides, this spell has some brand new elements that may topple common senses. I would definitely come up with ways to actively exploit this in the battlefield. Furthermore considering that there is probably very few people who can cast this type of large scale magic, we thus will turn the table around and have the advantage.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3064"><span>Anyhow, after sending everyone off yesterday, Rigurdo has since finished preparing the location for the refugee to spend the night. So I only intend to teleport them back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3065"><span>That’s how it is, to teleport everyone back as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3066"><span>They are also coping quite well. Those who are teleported back got used to it very quickly. No one showed any sign of distress, that’s impressive.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3067"><span>I told Rigurdo to lead everyone here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3068"><span>And I can continue to work on a certain something left over from yesterday.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3069"><span>I hope I could get this done on time with the Walpurgis Banquet and pray there wouldn’t be any emergency.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3070"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3071"><span>Everything has been smooth-sailing since and the day of Walpurgis Banquet has finally arrived.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3072"><span>I finished the work at hand before lunch and enter the final stage after noon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3073"><span>I finally got a breath as I seem to have caught up in time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3074"><span>「Rimuru, this is….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3075"><span>「How about it, isn’t it amazing?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3076"><span>「You are a genius!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3077"><span>Who are you by the way…… to put my question aside, I don’t have time with her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3078"><span>I need to rest myself well for the night.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3079"><span>That’s why, Ramiris, I’m gonna ignore your silly talk.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3080"><span>As such, I finished my lunch and entered the final stage of work.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3081"><span>I put the finalized product in my 「Stomach」 and head to the Dryad residence where Treyni-san lives. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3082"><span>Veldora also wanted to follow, but I told him to endure it for now. Although it’s unlikely, I left him there in case the town goes under attack.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3083"><span>Right now, the town of Tempest Federation is under the protection of Veldora’s 「Barrier」. It can also prevent Clayman’s eavesdrop, but it will be problematic if the barrier is removed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3084"><span>I told him to bring him out next time, and I, Ramiris and Treyni-san set out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3085"><span>I feel kind of sorry for him, however, I did tell Beretta to stay with Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3086"><span>He definitely would be handled like a servant, so I also feel sorry for Beretta. I’ve got to compensate him next time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3087"><span>Like that, we activated 「Dimension Manipulation」 and changed location.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3088"><span>As I arrive at the residence, I see the insect </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;Apito and Zegion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3089"><span>When I first rescued Apito, it was around fifty centimeters long. Now it has grown healthily to fifty centimeters. It makes me happy seeing it is able to grow up healthily.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3090"><span>The other one, Zegion, has grown to around seventy centimeters. It seems to have grown quite strong now that the lower </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;won’t even dare to mess with it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3091"><span>It seems that no </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;around here could beat Zegion, its strength is rather mysterious. I once told it to not be stubborn in battle, so he shouldn’t have fought any uncertain battle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3092"><span>Zegion is aware of his limitation unlike Gobuta or Gabiru who gets cocky everytime they improve. Zegion is a very reliable individual.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3093"><span>Apito happily approached us after discovering me and gifted me some hone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3094"><span>Thanks, this is an amazing medicine! Knowing so, I gotta take a bite fast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3095"><span>Honey is the perfect solution to smooth tiredness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3096"><span>As expected of the super rare and effective medicine that would cure anything illness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3097"><span>「R-Rimuru, wait up——no, Rimuru-san? I have something to ask you…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3098"><span>Ramiris starts to ask me with an anxious tone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3099"><span>「What’s wrong?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3100"><span>「T-that insect, wouldn’t it be a legion bee...right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3101"><span>「No idea, I don’t know.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3102"><span>「No idea.. I mean, are you seriously——!」 </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3103"><span>Ramiris is greatly shocked by it, so what if it is a legion bee?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3104"><span>「Rimuru-sama, as that sama has mentioned, I am the highest ranked breed among the Legion Bees, the Queen Bee. If you so desire, shall I summon my subordinates?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3105"><span>Oh oh, that sounds cool. But there’s no need for that right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3106"><span>「You can summon them when this residence is in danger. If you want to find your more of your companions, you can discuss that with Treyni-san and then summon.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3107"><span>「There is no need. Then I won’t summon them now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3108"><span>Apito flaps its wing and left happily with a “Buzzzzz” sound.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3109"><span>That buzz sound sounds both beautiful and cruel, and seem to be able to cut people in half with just its sound. Could it be that the Legion Bees are some type of dangerous </span><span>monster</span><span>?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3110"><span>——N-no way, right? Apito has been collecting honey for me, how can it be dangerous?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3111"><span>Besides there is Zegion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3112"><span>Zegion bows to me in silence and follows Apito away.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3113"><span>It really has some celebrity like style, resembling a lot to an insect king.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3114"><span>It may even grow stronger and evolve. I’ll invite him to be my subordinate by that time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3115"><span>I turn back to see Ramiris all speechless with Treyni-san comforting her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3116"><span>「You were right, it says it’s a Legion bee. And it seems to be a queen as well!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3117"><span>I try to talk to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3118"><span>「I heard it too! Seriously, you…….Uhh, never mind. Your ability seems to have no bound. Speaking of that, the other one also seems…no, there’s no way…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3119"><span>Etc, she begins to say some bizarre things. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3120"><span>It’s annoying trying to get in her head, plus there’s no time, so i won’t put this on my mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3121"><span>Whatever Ramiris says is probably not important, probably.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3122"><span>We’ve reached our destination.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3123"><span>Below the core of Treyni-san——The Giant Spirit Tree.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3124"><span>I take out the completed work from my 「Stomach」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3125"><span>As for what it is, it’s actually a dark orb.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3126"><span>There is no light reflecting on it nor is there any shining from it. However, this object carries certain power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3127"><span>Its usage would be…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3128"><span>Treyni-san——to be more accurate, Dryads, are the offspring of fairies. They are spiritual life form that gained their bodies by merging with trees. This created their physical bodies that are made up of magicule, which allows their astral body to possess and leave at will.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3129"><span>But no matter how they do it, their core remains within the forest, that is the Great Spirit Tree.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3130"><span>It would seem that the location of Walpurgis Banquet is set in a special dimension where Treyni-san may be rejected from entering. Considering that,I decided to operate a big surgery to free her core from its restrain.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3131"><span>Unlike Beretta, who doesn’t possess a body in the physical world, Treyni-san has one. That’s why in order for her to possess onto a new body, I need to transfer the core of her current body to the new one.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3132"><span>With a new core that is, I’ve got that part covered.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3133"><span>I am able to produce 「Holy Magic Core」</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;The name here is “Holy Demonic Core”, so basically mixing properties of both elements of holy and demonic" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;under special conditions and with the necessary ingredients. The orb I just took out is the vessel for the「Holy Magic Core」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3134"><span>To explain these, it is like extracting the magicule stone from a </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;and getting rid of the magicules in it. It is very hard to turn it into one without any attribute, I failed several times before success. And I spent the day before collecting the necessary ingredients for creating this vessel.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3135"><span>In order to create 「Holy Magic Core」, I need to balance the holy aura and monster aura within the vessel. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3136"><span>If it’s for Beretta, you only need to take the same amount of both before reversing their properties.

I think it suits you very well. How did you come across it?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3311"><span>She guessed that Milim would want her to ask more, so she did.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3312"><span>Milim, on the other, hand starts to beat around the bush: 「Do you want to know? Now what should I do——I guess I can tell you….Hmm——what to do, what to do——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3313"><span>Annoying. Such an act is even irritating to Frey who’s been used to her actions for all these years of interactions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3314"><span>「Ah, Milim. Aren’t we “Friends”? So it should be fine to tell me, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3315"><span>Milim’s eyes shines hearing Frey’s words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3316"><span>「That’s right! Indeed, indeed. We are friends! Alright, I’ll tell you! As a matter of fact——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3317"><span>She seemed happy hearing Frey’s words. Milim then started to tell Frey all about the </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;town happily.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3318"><span>Frey kept on listening to her unstopping bragging and was forced to admire different outfits of hers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3319"><span>Frey couldn’t hide her confusion since she has never seen Milim been in such a happy state.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3320"><span>But with that being said, Frey determined it was time to carry out her promise with Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3321"><span>「Right, Milim. As a “Friend”, I would like to gift you something. Are you willing to take it?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3322"><span>After which, Frey signalled her maid.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3323"><span>The maid brought an object to them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3324"><span>It was a beautiful shining pendant with a purple fabric as a base. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3325"><span>The pendant has a beautiful orb engraved onto it. It’s most certainly top-ranked goods, the type that even outsiders could tell it costs a fortune.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3326"><span>「Hmm? Isn’t this a pendant? Can I take it? But I won’t give you my knuckles even if I take this from you!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3327"><span>Frey responded with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3328"><span>「No problem, Milim. This thing shall symbolize our friendship. Since it’s a gift from “Friend’, you don’t have to be courteous with me. I’d be happy if you are willing to wear it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3329"><span>Frey hurries her with a kind smile, and Milim nods while smiling.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3330"><span>「Then just wait and see!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3331"><span>After which, Milim puts it on her with a smile on her face.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3332"><span>《Forbidden curse 「Demon Lord Domination」...... Conjured successfully.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3333"><span>At that moment, the expression on Milim’s face faded instantly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3334"><span>There was nothing else in her eyes, the light within them that symbolizes consciousness has faded away.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3335"><span>The pendant has released its magic and the forbidden curse has corrupted Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3336"><span>This pendant was the secret jewel given to </span><span>Frey</span><span>&nbsp;by Clayman——The orb of domination. As for why she let Milim put on the pendant, it was because this was the deal she made with Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3337"><span>Alight, I’ve done my part of the bargain. Then my duty is now done, what would happen to Milim——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3338"><span>Frey begins to observe Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3339"><span>She looks like a human doll with masquerade on, just standing there without any emotion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3340"><span>For a moment, there were weak signs of struggle. Frey seemed to have crossed her eyes with Milim’s blue eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3341"><span>For that instant, Frey senses something was amiss.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3342"><span>Could it be——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3343"><span>Right, that means…. That’s what it was, right, Milim——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3344"><span>The dragon knuckles slipped through Milim’s joints and fell.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3345"><span>Frey loosened her breath seeing this.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3346"><span>「It’s done Clayman. Will this do?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3347"><span>There was nothing in the shades of the room. Frey talked naturally towards a specific place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3348"><span>There on the spot emerged a shadow, it was Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3349"><span>「Hohoho. Thanks for the trouble, Frey. Looks like now I’ve gained the strongest puppet! Gohahahaha——! This is what happens when you look down on me as some newbie Demon Lord. How embarrassing you look now, Milim!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3350"><span>Clayman lets out his laughter and begins to hit Milim hard with his hands.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3351"><span>Milim’s tender cheek begins to swell and her lips are spl.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3352"><span>Without the multiple 「Barrier」to defend herself, even Milim would be injured.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3353"><span>This pluses the opponent being Clayman, a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3354"><span>Of course she would bleed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3355"><span>Clayman, with a light smile on his face, decides to continue his attack, however Frey responded coldly: 「I’d suggest you refrain yourself.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3356"><span>This is no comfortable scene to look at, besides——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3357"><span>「Huh! Don’t you think that this curse is some cheap shot that would be deactivated with a couple of hits. This is a forbidden curse with a massive amount of my magic inserted. Aren’t you annoyed too that she’s always acting all smug? That’s why you assisted me in the first place, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3358"><span>「No. I did it to simply carry out our promise.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3359"><span>「Don’t act all high and mighty now. You are welcome. This guy is just a puppet now, a very endurable one, as long as I repair it before breaking it completely.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3360"><span>Clayman’s eyes showed signs of madness as he gives Milim a kick to send her flying away. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3361"><span>Frey looks at Clayman’s actions with cold eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3362"><span>What an ugly man. So this is your nature——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3363"><span>As such, Frey has seen through this man named Clayman. From now on, she decides to trust her instinct and take actions on her own.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3364"><span>「I mean, Clayman. You may not be aware but Milim has a self-defense mechanism. I once heard it from Milim that it is called 『Frenzy Berserk』. It would lead her to an uncontrolled state. You can go ahead and get yourself killed by it, just leave me out of it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3365"><span>With Frey’s reminder, Clayman finally regained calmness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3366"><span>He smacks his lip with discontent.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3367"><span>「*smacks lip* Ze, what’s wrong with this demon lord… Anyway, if I play her right, I’ll get more of a voice during my speech. Frey, you are my accomplice. So you’d better work for me like a doll. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3368"><span>「Are? Aren’t we supposed to be on equal term?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3369"><span>「You idiot! I made this plan. You are already my pawn. Or perhaps, you want to take a brawl with Milim?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3370"><span>「——Are you threatening me?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3371"><span>「Gohahahah! Whichever way you like to see it. If you don’t want to die, you’d better stay on my good side.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3372"><span>To impose someone with both threats and compassion</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;This is a Japanese idiom, 恩威並行 or 恩威並び行われる" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>, that would be an appropriate phrase to describe Clayman’s arrogant speech.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3373"><span>Indeed, the plan was made by Clayman, plus information from unknown sources.After all Milim can’t quite resist the word “Friend”.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3374"><span>Frey is merely following her deal. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3375"><span>But the reason why she committed to it was because she has faith in certain things——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3376"><span>「...I understand.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3377"><span>「That’s right. Don’t even think about betraying me. If you’d like to hear my request, I’ll allow you to continue as &nbsp;『Ruler of the sky』. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3378"><span>She is at the point of no return.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3379"><span>As such, Frey has fallen as Clayman’s accomplice——or his puppet in reality.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3380"><span>——These are the events that took place several weeks before the day of destruction.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3381"><span>………………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3382"><span>…………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3383"><span>……</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3384"><span>Having withdrawn from the memory of that time, Frey sighs quietly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3385"><span>Clayman has full control over Milim. With such violent power to back himself up, he’s able to put high pressure on Frey as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3386"><span>Right now, Frey follows Clayman’s order and is forced to be his accomplice. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3387"><span>This must have been her own doing——She mocks herself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3388"><span>She was stupid enough to have trusted Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3389"><span>But, on the other hand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3390"><span>Clayman is a cunning Demon Lord that can’t be underestimated.

How have you been? I’m glad you’ve responded to my invitation. I should thank you for that.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3444"><span>That is a wonderfully alluring voice.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3445"><span>His crimson red eyes has sparkled gold stars within; His slightly curly hair looks scarlet red like burning flame, its redness is thicker than the color of blood.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3446"><span>He’s about the same height as Leon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3447"><span>As opposed to Leon’s feminine beauty, Guy’s beauty comes from a place of pride and lonesomeness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3448"><span>Such eerily bizarre beauty exudes the aura of an overlord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3449"><span>He speaks to Leon and starts to move down from his high throne to Leon’s face.

It's a rather intriguing scenery that bears a devilish charm.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3462"><span>Guy could switch his gender at will, and both men and women can invoke his lust.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3463"><span>That is him——her——This is the Demon Lord Guy Crimson. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3464"><span>The owner of this castle, the strongest, most ancient Demon Lord——The overlord of this forever frozen continent, who rules in the name of 「Lord of Darkness」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3465"><span>Guy didn’t tend to Leon and walk in front by himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3466"><span>Leon naturally follows behind him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3467"><span>Before the two could exit the hall, no one present dares to make a single noise.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3468"><span>Since that is not permitted.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3469"><span>Everyone bows their heads low and await quietly before their master and the guest to leave.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3470"><span>After confirming Leon has left, Misery and Rain raise up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3471"><span>They thus say:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3472"><span>「Dismiss.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3473"><span>Rain herself also gives order to several subordinates. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3474"><span>Misery and Rain thus leave to prepare tea for the guest.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3475"><span>They have the highest position among the demons in the castle, and their role however, happen to be taking care of their master, Demon Lord Guy Crimson’s daily chores. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3476"><span>There’s not any work more important than theirs in this castle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3477"><span>——Before their master loses his temper, they’d better hurry up with their work.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3478"><span>………………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3479"><span>…………</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3480"><span>……</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3481"><span>Leon followed Guy to the top of the frost balcony. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3482"><span>Although the location is open to outside, not a single flake of snow is allowed to enter.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3483"><span>It has been made into a comfortable space after accomodation. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3484"><span>Guy isn’t affected by the environment at all.

Leon thinks to himself while he sits down with Guy’s invitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3487"><span>The chair is made of ice, yet the there is no sense of chilliness felt from it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3488"><span>Leon though isn’t surprised at all. He instead inquires:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3489"><span>「So, why did you call me here?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3490"><span>He falls back to his chair as the ice chair catches him gently.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3491"><span>The same as usual.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3492"><span>Somehow a ice table appears out of nowhere, and Rain begins to serve tea to them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3493"><span>Misery quitely awaits outside of the balcony entrance.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3494"><span>They won’t at all interfere with the conversation between their master and his guest. Not a single word is permitted to be spoken.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3495"><span>There is no equal relationship here.

They are nothing but tools in front of demon lord such as Guy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3498"><span>That’s how strong Guy is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3499"><span>This is why even if Leon launches an attack on Guy, they will not intervene on their own.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3500"><span>Guy is the absolute ruler and it would be a great disrespect to even worry about Guy’s safety.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3501"><span>That’s why they are being treated like air.

Very well, perhaps I’ll fill you in then——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3507"><span>Guy shows a joyful smile and said so, thus begins his explanation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3508"><span>「——The one proposing the meeting this time is Clayman, no one special.

It can only mean—— 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3509"><span>「There’s something strange about <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s death. Is that where you are trying to get?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3510"><span>「Ehh, so you do know about it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3511"><span>Guy’s mood got a lot worse having been guessed what he’s trying to say. But Leon didn’t seem to care and continues with his words:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3512"><span>「Clayman really went above the line this time. He’s always been causing trouble for me without leaving any trace, but this time I can’t just sit and take it. Apart from the whereabout of <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it’ll be trouble if Milim moves out.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3513"><span>He says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3514"><span>Hearing so, Guy nods happily.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3515"><span>「Hmm, that’s exactly my thought. It may be a game to Milim just like before, but if the balance among Demon Lords are to be broken, it won’t be child’s play anymore. I’ll certainly have to do more work. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3516"><span>Guy regained his good mood, followed by Leon who asks the most pressing question: </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3517"><span>「By the way, Guy. Do you think Milim have been manipulated by Clayman?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3518"><span>The question is asked, but Guy’s response shows his lack of care towards the issue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3519"><span>「It won’t matter much to worry over Milim’s business. Smart people like me will never understand what an idiot is thinking. That is one of my few weakness.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3520"><span>He shrugs as he finishes and throws a smile him a smile. Then he turns the topic back on the original question.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3521"><span>「Look how concerned you look now. Leon, does this mean you are interested in taking part in the Banquet, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3522"><span>There is no use trying to probe the thoughts of one another, so Leon decides to reply honestly:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3523"><span>「Yeah, I was planning to. Although I hate to spend time around others, I guess I’ll have to participate this time.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3524"><span>「Oh? That’s great. And I was planning to spend the night with you (on bottom) then—— 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3525"><span>「I told you I don’t do it with man. And even if it’s a woman, I won’t do it with ones I don’t like. Plus I don’t get stand to gain anything sleeping with you....」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3526"><span>「Ehhh, don’t be so hasty now. If you really mean it, I can turn myself into a woman…….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3527"><span>As soon as Leon finishes, Guy begins to harass Leon all seductive looking. But Leon has expected that and gave him a perfect counter</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3528"><span>The two often play this game of offense and defense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3529"><span>「Right, Leon. Ramiris seldom expresses her opinion, so how much do you know about the person called “Rimuru”?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3530"><span>Since Leon won’t bite, Guy changes to another topic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3531"><span>This is also related to the topic at hand. There has been new demon lord after Leon, and the rest of the demon lords seem to be interested in this topic as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3532"><span>「From Clayman’s testimony, he seemed to have crowned himself the title Demon Lord without our approval. I personally think that this Rimuru guy can be a Demon Lord if he is powerful enough.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3533"><span>「Oh, so you think he’s qualified. Ramiris also came to stir the pot. I’m rather intrigued by this whole ordeal since it was sufficient to get her interest. I definitely can have some fun with this Rimuru. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3534"><span>Clayman was the one initiating the Banquet, and with Ramiris’ request, the person involved Rimuru would also join.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3535"><span>So they can safely deduce that Ramiris has a say to Clayman’s action this time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3536"><span>「——Ramiris, well. I’m no good against that elf. Everytime we meet she makes fun of me.I kinda want to strangle her to death for a few times….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3537"><span>But even so, since Ramiris has already spoken, Leon could only nod in agreement. He still feels some moral responsibility towards her, so he has to comply. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3538"><span>「Ahahaha. Come on now. If you kill Ramiris, I’ll become your enemy then.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3539"><span>「I thought as much. But it’s me saying. Plus I stand no chance against you anyway.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3540"><span>That’s true.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3541"><span>Leon only dislikes Ramiris for making fun of him, he doesn’t really mean any harm to her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3542"><span>Besides, Leon stands no chance winning against Guy. That part is true too. Despite both of them are all demon lords, their difference in power is heaven and earth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3543"><span>Guy’s power is almost from a different dimension compared to people like Leon and Misery.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3544"><span>「Hmm? How could that be? If it is you, you still have a one in a million chance to kill me, you know?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3545"><span>「No way. I only fight battles that I can win.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3546"><span>「Come on, don’t be so modest. Basically, there’re very few people who can hurt me. I may actually die in your hand, since you are a powerful guy, Leon. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3547"><span>「Heh, you don’t say. It’s because you are Milim are way too strong. Speaking of being unreasonably strong——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3548"><span>Leon recalls something while saying so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3549"><span>——He heard that 「Storm Dragon」Veldora has awakened. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3550"><span>That would be a first that Leon has surprised Guy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3551"><span>Suddenly, a voice cold as ice interrupts the two’s conversation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3552"><span>「Ara ara, now that is intriguing.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3553"><span>The owner of the voice is a beautiful female. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3554"><span>One with snow white skin like porcelain. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3555"><span>Her eyes that emits cold light is seductive and they are blue like the deep sea. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3556"><span>Her pearl-white hair droops down along her cheek and her light red lips look extremely eye-catching.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3557"><span>The woman walked forward and spoke without Guy’s permission.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3558"><span>She possesses a beautiful aura around her more shining than jewels. People call her 「Ice Empress」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3559"><span>Or perhaps——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3560"><span>She has a better known name, 「White Ice Dragon」 Velzado.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3561"><span>She is the one of the four remaining 「True Dragon」, a friend——and partner to the Demon Lord Guy Crimson.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3562"><span>In other words, she gets to sit on equal ground to Guy like Leon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3563"><span>「Oh, It’s Velzado. That being said, I almost forgot that there is a 『True Dragon』 here too.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3564"><span>Leon plays dumb and says.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3565"><span>「Ayy? Aren’t you cold as always? But, I’m pretty happy you decided to show up.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3566"><span>「Is that so? I also get to have a eyes’ full of you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3567"><span>Leon and Velzado exchanges some polite greets.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3568"><span>Boths’ are pretenses.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3569"><span>「Huh. You two are always like this, just can’t get along with each other.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3570"><span>Guy’s rather irritated while saying so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3571"><span>With that being said though, Guy doesn’t plan to help mitigate their relation at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3572"><span>If it’s usual, they would continue to exchange those fake-sounding courtesy, but——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3573"><span>「——right, so as you were saying…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3574"><span>This time, Velzado took the initiative in changing the topic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3575"><span>「Leon-sama, did you just say that my “younger brother” has awaken?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3576"><span>Her blue eyes shine as she asks, meaning to see if Leon’s shocking news is true or not. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3577"><span>「Is that true, Leon?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3578"><span>「His presence disappears around two years ago, and I thought he was gone for good.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3579"><span>If Veldora is revived, the overwhelming magicule outburst will most certainly cause drastic change to climate of the land for them to notice. However, there was no sign of such a thing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3580"><span>That’s why both Guy and Velzado are surprised.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3581"><span>「There’s no way around it. The source came from the spies I sent to the western states. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3582"><span>「Oh…..? If that’s true, why have that evil dragon been so quiet? Has he weakened so much that he can’t even resupply his own magicule on his own?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3583"><span>「On top of that, who could have broken the seal on that child? I thought he doesn’t possess the power to break it by himself——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3584"><span>Veldora was sealed by a Chosen Hero</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Differentiate Chosen Hero (勇者) and Hero (英雄). In English, this two words are interchangeable and would be justified to use “hero” for both in most cases. However, in the Slime series, “Chosen Hero” is a title like “Demon Lord”, entailing the owner of the title to be the protector of mankind. A hero on the other hand can be anyone with remarkable achievements such as “Hero Youmu”. There are only handful of Chosen Heroes in slime so I’ll use this to differentiate them from other “Hero”." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3585"><span>In Veldoza’s view, it was the appropriate punishment for her reckless brother. So she has intentionally left the seal as it was. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3586"><span>If he reflects himself well and finally decides to be a doll. Velzado would have given him a helping hand before he gets completely eliminated. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3587"><span>When Veldora first disappeared from the world, she was rather confused. Since the time of his destruction seems too early compared to the time Velzado has predicted. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3588"><span>「From the report of the spy, Clayman’s conspiracy seems to have been the main cause. He forced the western state to take actions, the great kingdom of <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to be particular. He found people to instigate them to invade and eliminate the Jura Forest Alliance built by Rimuru. As it turns out, the <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army was completely decimated. And now Rimuru comes out and calls himself a demon lord. &nbsp;」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3589"><span>「You know your stuff well, Leon.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3590"><span>「Of course. Unlike you, I used to be human. Apart from that, I confirmed that Veldora was indeed resting near the frontline of the battle. It is rumored that the truth of the matter is that Veldora, almost near his demise was able to awake after absorbing the large amount of blood tainted on the battlefield. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3591"><span>Rimuru was able to escape from danger after <span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army was involved in this whole ordeal and was eliminated completely. Leon adds on top of his explanation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3592"><span>「So that was the case. Then was the breaking of seal just a coincidence? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3593"><span>「Don’t know. I wasn’t informed on that matter.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3594"><span>That’s true too, Velzado nods in response.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3595"><span>Leon’s correct, there’s no way to judge that simply from espionage. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3596"><span>The Chosen Hero’s unique skill 「Infinite Prison」 was able to lock the targeted object into an imaginary space. It isn’t weak enough to have it revoked from the affected individual trapped inside. But even if that’s the case, the presence of Veldora has yet to influence the world.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3597"><span>「Perhaps there’s some flaws with Chosen Hero’s seal…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3598"><span>That would make more sense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3599"><span>Velzado thinks so, yet Leon expresses something unexpected to her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3600"><span>「That’s possible. But allow me to propose a theory. What if someone created a subspace that absorbed both veldora and the seal?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3601"><span>The theory interests with Guy as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3602"><span>「Interesting! If that’s the case, this unknown individual could then unlock the Chosen Hero’s seal. That sel seems to have a special tie with the Chosen Hero and cannot be undone using normal skills. It may be solvable if we are the one dealing with it, in other words, this mysterious person has power to rival us.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3603"><span>Guy says so with great pleasure.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3604"><span>「But regardless, it’s just a possibility.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3605"><span>「So you think that mysterious individual is “Rimuru”, right, Leon?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3606"><span>「——That’s right.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3607"><span>「I see. If that’s the case, I do need to meet him.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3608"><span>And Guy thought Leon’s difference in attitude in attending the meeting is a rare sight of a lifetime. But if this is the case, that would certainly make more sense. Guy finally realizes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3609"><span>Clayman is being reckless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3610"><span>Milim has been acting weird.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3611"><span>And Rimuru proclaims himself Demon Lord alongside with Veldora losing his seal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3612"><span>If we assume all of these events are all connected…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3613"><span>This Walpurgis Banquet has indeed become very interesting. An intoxicating smile emerges on Guy’s face as he thinks so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3614"><span>But suddenly something came up on his mind that concerns him, Guy starts to mumble:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3615"><span>「But speaking of that, why has Veldora become so quiet?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3616"><span>Velzado makes the following response.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3617"><span>「——He seems to have become weak. The reaction is extremely weak, hardly as powerful as before.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3618"><span>Velzado is also a 「True Dragon」, so Veldora’s presence hasn’t been so weak that she can’t find with some efforts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3619"><span>It would make the most sense if it due to him becoming weaker….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3620"><span>「But, it’s rather disappointing that he hasn’t gone on a rampage by now. If it’s that child’s personality, chaos is his way of life.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3621"><span>Velzado also doesn’t get why that was the case.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3622"><span>「Anyhow, it doesn't matter. I’m not really interested in Veldora. If you guys want to get him on board, then be my guest.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3623"><span>Leon says so without a care and decides to stand up from his seat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3624"><span>Unlike Velzado who are the same race as Veldora, or Guy who is worrying about what to about him, this is all none of Leon’s business. As long as Veldora stays away from Leon’s territory, he won’t actively care about what Veldora does.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3625"><span>That is how difficult it is to deal with the evil dragon Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3626"><span>「Are you leaving already?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3627"><span>「Yeah, didn’t you call me for these?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3628"><span>「Ehh, just wait a little longer, don’t be in such a rush? Right, have you got any closer to your “specific summoning”?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3629"><span>In order to prevent Leon from leaving, Guy asks him about the result of his experiments.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3630"><span>It is after all, experiments Leon spent all his life investing. So Guy is also quite interested in the result.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3631"><span>「......well, about that, I haven’t made much progress. I’ve changed my method to random summoning but it always ended up in failure. It’s also attracting too much attention. I had intentionally theorized “incomplete summoning” and leaked the news to the western states. But then the Freedom Association began to intervene. The current method is hardly efficient considering the probabilities, and since there may be more people come and try to intervene. I am considering to try an alternative in the future. &nbsp;」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3632"><span>Honestly, Leon has little interest for the Walpurgis Banquet or the new Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3633"><span>He simply wants to eliminate any possible threat that may intervene his research early. That is all he cared. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3634"><span>「You said intervention?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3635"><span>「Yeah. They saved a bunch of kids who were going to die anyway——before I could receive the them.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3636"><span>「I see. So they were taken away by force before you got the results. Then, these recuerser would likely intervene in the future too.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3637"><span>「That’s probably the case. That guy seems to be also annoyed by the summoning of children around the countries, so he may even pressure these countries. Given the circumstance, I won’t continue my experiment. If I am to continue, I may get exposed of being behind the scene one day.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3638"><span>「Hmm, why don’t you just eliminate the nuisance?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3639"><span>It should be a chore if it’s you right? Guy sends the signal through his eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3640"><span>But, Leon instead sighs to Guy’s words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3641"><span>「The nuisance individual happens to be the “Rimuru” I just mentioned.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3642"><span>「Nani? Could this really be just coincidence?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3643"><span>「Isn’t that interesting? That’s why I wish to see him as well.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3644"><span>Leon nods looking all serious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3645"><span>With that being said, had Ramiris not come and stir the pot, he may have overlooked the issue…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3646"><span>「Is that so, now I’m even more interested in him. Perhaps Milim thought the same way like me. That girl may be silly, but her instinct is quite keen.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3647"><span>「Perhaps. Anyway, there’s gonna be hell of a show during tonight’s Banquet.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3648"><span>「Hehe, that’s right.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3649"><span>Upon saying so, the two smiles at each other.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3650"><span>Velzado observes the two on the side with a gentle look in her blue eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3651"><span>After that they continued to chat with joy for a while before Guy changed the subject:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3652"><span>「Speaking of which, I’ve been curious about something. Who is the supplier of your intelligences all this time?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3653"><span>「He apparently came from the Eastern Empire. I’ve got no clue about the detail. He’s a self-proclaimed merchant.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3654"><span>In order to summon 「Otherworlder」, it requires a large amount of magicule, specific conditions and rituals. There are many complicated factors involved.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3655"><span>The more sufficient one prepares with these factors in mind, the longer interval it will be for one to prepare a second summoning.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3656"><span>That is why Leon has made a deal with that merchant to have him conduct the summoning in his place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3657"><span>「So, is this merchant trust-worthy?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3658"><span>「Trust? I have no use for that, I’m simply manipulating him for now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3659"><span>「Is that so? Do what you like, I’ve got no objection. But don’t get careless with it! I won’t allow you to die without my permission.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3660"><span>「Hehehe, are you worrying about me? How rare, Guy. Don’t worry. I won’t just die without achieving my goal.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3661"><span>「Here we go again…. Is that thing really this important?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3662"><span>「Yeah it is. To me, it’s the most important thing in the world.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3663"><span>「Is that so? That makes me jealous.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3664"><span>「Spare the sweet talk. I’ll keep your advice in mind. Then, I’ll see you tonight.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3665"><span>With that being said, Leon leaves the castle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3666"><span>This time Guy did not try to stop him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3667"><span>There are crystals of light</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Not sure what this is exactly, apparently it refers the remains of some beams of light as Leon leaves." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;left at the scene as Leon exits with 「Dimensional Transportation」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3668"><span>Two pairs of eyes observe as he departed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3669"><span>「He’s always in such a rush. Well, that’s Leon for you….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3670"><span>Guy gives off a wry smile while saying so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3671"><span>「But Leon has always been cautious. Yet this time his plans are flawed with exploits. He doesn't seem to know the identity of his assistor. Should we help him to find it out?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3672"><span>Velzado asks in a cold tone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3673"><span>「No need for that.

It is a skill specialized in controlling one’s power output.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3812"><span>His power will not go out of control no matter how much strength he puts into it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3813"><span>The secret lies within 「Prediction Analysis」, an ability which can completely analyze the flow of one’s strength and remove inefficiencies from it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3814"><span>Not only is it a great skill for personal combat, it is also useful in leading army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3815"><span>By treating the army’s movements as a flow of power, it can act as something similar to a predicting skill to determine the outcome of a situation.

The overall strength of the army, consequently, is also increased by about thirty percent. The army is on par with the enemies in terms of number, and with the addition of superior soldiers, there is no reason why we would lose. With the adjustment of other skills, our chance of victory is even higher than before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3821"><span>——All because Benimaru is in possession of such a powerful ability now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3822"><span>It would seem that our army has secured the victory as soon as the battle starts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3823"><span>That’s why he came up with a new attack plan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3824"><span>「——It’s just like this, we want to directly invade the enemy base. Souei is also tempted to try it out. Since we’re all here, we should take down the suspected Clayman’s castle in the fog bank as well.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3825"><span>Benimaru sure lives up to his reputation, What great confidence it is coming from him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3826"><span>「But wouldn’t that be too dangerous? The fight has just begun and victory is still not guaranteed….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3827"><span>「No problem. I’ve got it covered.

What’s wrong, Shuna?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3832"><span>Just like me, we both got a bit spooked.

Doesn’t that Demon Lord Clayman possess dangerous power to manipulate people?

If you really insist on sending them, I want to participate in the battle as well!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3836"><span>Oi oi oi! I thought that Shuna is the well-behaved, quiet type, so why is &nbsp;she making these kinds of demands now?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3837"><span>But my surprise was ignored as Benimaru continued to argue with Shuna.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3838"><span>Brothers can never win in an argument against their sisters——That is what a friend from my last life once told me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3839"><span>Benimaru is not as confident sounding as before, he can’t win the argument and got pinned down by Shuna with her arguments.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3840"><span>Then——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3841"><span>「That’s how it is, Rimuru-sama, please grant me permission to participate in the battle!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3842"><span>Shuna proposes with smile all over her face.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3843"><span>Hmm——even if you say so…… </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3844"><span>I don’t want to send Shuna to such a dangerous place either, but she does have a point. It would indeed be problematic if Souei and the rest got manipulated.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3845"><span>If that’s the case then should we not be trying to attack like this in the first place? However, it will certainly be the best opportunity to take the castle and prevent the enemy army from retreating back to their base. Indeed, the time that Clayman is absent for Walpurgis Banquet is our fated one and only chance.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3846"><span>But, it should be okay as long as I prevent Clayman from escaping.

This means I can collect information regarding the rest of the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3872"><span>Many Demon Lords seemed to have fought against Veldora due to him causing havoc around the world.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3873"><span>Around two thousand years ago, he once destroyed the city of vampire. He was pursued by the pissed off vampires. And its story seems to be quite interesting….. It seems that one of them was a slim and beautiful female vampire whose power is far beyond the rest of her race. These vampires later disappear without a trace, and even Veldora doesn’t seem to know of their whereabout.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3874"><span>「What’s her name now…...was it Ru..Lulus? No, or it should be Milus, right? (D: The name is still wrong btw) Anyhow, though I didn’t give it my all, she’s still not some simpleton to have been able to play a round with me, so you’ve got to be careful!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3875"><span>Veldora says that vampire doesn’t have a sense of humor, but, he’s probably the one at fault.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3876"><span>Of course she would get pissed seeing her own country getting destroyed and burning to ashes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3877"><span>Anyone would get pissed by it, even I would have lashed out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3878"><span>But that’s a long time ago, so I’m not sure about that now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3879"><span>「Oh, about that, now a man called Valentine has become the Demon Lord!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3880"><span>Ramiris shouts, who has been listening to Veldora recalling ancient tales.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3881"><span>It seems the exchange of power took place around fifteen thousands years ago. Hopefully the hatred against Veldora held by the vampire race has died off.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3882"><span>The Titan race Demon Lord also seemed to be a strong opponent against Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3883"><span>They’ve fought several times without a definitive winner.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3884"><span>No wonder why Veldora has his name memorized, he sounds like a super duper extrememo bananaz fighter (D: Anymore adjective, Gavin?). If he was able to fight against Veldora, it means he has already possesses power to rival a 「True Dragon」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3885"><span>That is very high leveled even for Demon Lord standards.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3886"><span>Lastly it’s the Demon race.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3887"><span>He seems to have beaten up the demons several times. But even with their bodies destroyed, they would resurrect after a period of time. They seem to be a group of very interesting opponents.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3888"><span>And they even grew stronger over time, which gave Veldora a fun play thing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3889"><span>However, he didn’t seem to have fought against the king of the demon race.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3890"><span>His castle is rumored to be located on the permanently frozen land of the northern continent. The place is too cold to habitable, which is why Veldora never visited.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3891"><span>Veldora glossed over this part saying: 「Anyhow, that type of wasteland is not worth my visit! Gahahahaha!」 as he laughs.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3892"><span>Something must have happened, but no matter how I inquire, he just won’t tell me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3893"><span>But there really isn’t a need to go out of your way to visit that kind of place, so I won’t follow it up</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3894"><span>「That’s right, because Guy is very strong.

That makes up ten in total.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3910"><span>Veldora has provoked some Demon Lords in the past, so I have to be careful in how I interact with them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3911"><span>By the way, the Demon Lords seem to be more powerful than I imagined.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3912"><span>It’s not fair to use a brat like Ramiris as a standard.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3913"><span>It’s probably more appropriate to have Milim as the standard. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_3914"><span>Even with my evolution now, I still wouldn’t have much chance against Milim in battle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3915"><span>I’ve spared against her several times by now, but in none of our matches did MIlim show her true power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3916"><span>Insufficient information.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3917"><span>I can stand a chance if Milim is participating in a training with me, but I’d better not get over myself not knowing how she is when she gets serious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3918"><span>But, it is still unbelievable that Milim would agree to wage a crusade on me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3919"><span>There must be someone behind this…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3920"><span>Milim shouldn’t be so naive as to allow herself be manipulated like this. She isn’t communicate with that many people in the first place, moreover, her personality doesn’t seem like the kind to betray others.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3921"><span>All I can think of it’s that Milim has done this because of some unknown reason.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3922"><span>But, it’s no use thinking about this now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3923"><span>I’ll decide after I meet her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3924"><span>As we continued to chat, I sudden feel a distortion in the space dimension before me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3925"><span>It would seem our guide arrived.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3926"><span>A bizarre door appears before my eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3927"><span>The door looks extremely extravagant as if someone is trying to show off intentionally.

In order to evolve further, certain things are necessary……. In the case of Diablo, it is me giving him a 「Name」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3937"><span>With name acquired, Diablo was able to break through the limit of Demon race and evolved from a Greater Demon General to a Demon Noble.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_3938"><span>「Kufufufufu.

Even when the enemies are all veterans under the cunning Demon Lord Clayman…….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4032"><span>The more surprising fact is that his attack plan has taken the precautions to bring the enemies into captivity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4033"><span>Given how war works in this world, it is much simpler to kill the enemies rather than pursuing and capturing them. The commander won’t care for any surrenders when he can just use a large radius magical attack to wipe them all out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4034"><span>The captives are not captured because they happen to survive, instead they are captured as forced labor. This idea has never been seen in practice before. However, Benimaru and the rest seem to think this to be common sense and put it into practice.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4035"><span>This makes the Beastketeers feel extremely fearful.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4036"><span>It would mean——Majins under Rimuru don’t think they would be defeated at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4037"><span>They must have enter the battlefield with the confidence that their army would win no matter what.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4038"><span>「However, it would be based on the condition that everything goes smoothly according to our attack plan.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4039"><span>Benimaru smiles and answers while the Beastketeers both respects and fear him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4040"><span>And soon, the fight broke out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4041"><span>「Souei, engage according to the plan.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4042"><span>「Understood, Benimaru-sama.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4043"><span>Soon after this brief conversation, the first casualty appeared within Clayman’s army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4044"><span>It seems to be a named Majin who’s leading several hundred other Majins. His died instantly at the scene as his magical core was pierced by Souka who suddenly emerged.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4045"><span>The other four subordinates of Souei also simultaneously took the heads of the other captains under Clayman’s army. Following Benimaru’s instructions, they’ve only assassinated opponents that they are confident enough to win against.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4046"><span>They followed through on Benimaru’s instructed actions and achieved a one hundred percent precision.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4047"><span>Since the command chains of Clayman’s army is now shattered to pieces, the officers’ order won’t be able to reach the soldiers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4048"><span>As such——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4049"><span>「It’s a trap!

We have to retreat for now to reorganize our troop!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4052"><span>But they discovered it too late.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4053"><span>Unlike human army, the </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;army often relies on personal performance, which is why a captain is needed. Now without the captions, Clayman’s army has plunged into chaos.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4054"><span>「Geld, you may begin.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4055"><span>「Understood!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4056"><span>With Benimaru’s order, Geld begins to dispatch his commands.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4057"><span>「Prepare to engage!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4058"><span>「「「Yes sir!」」」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4059"><span>The next instant, the ground suddenly collapses onto itself, burying many soldiers from Clayman’s army. This is because of the activation of earth manipulating skills. The seemingly natural and flat plain is in fact a temporary ground that was set up using skills with many traps hidden within. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4060"><span>The only ones who successfully escaped are the flying </span><span>monster</span><span>s. However these individuals with flying abilities couldn’t escape either as they are soon taken down by the Bird-Type Beastmen troops and the「Hiryuu」 led by Gabiru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4061"><span>Now let’s check on the ones who triggered the traps.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4062"><span>Rimuru’s army has prepared large cave with quicksand</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;This is not exactly quicksand, the term here is “liquefied soil”, a phenomenon where the soil loses strength and stiffness, often seen during earthquake." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;like soil at the bottom. This is non-lethal but would render anyone sinked into it unable to move below their waist. But with that being said, this is an army of </span><span>monster</span><span>s after all. Some people managed to escape using magic and other special abilities.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4063"><span>As they struggle the strong kick aside the weak making them fall down to the bottom. The remainder now gather around the edges of the cave.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4064"><span>However, this is an important part of the plan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4065"><span>Rimuru’s army has intentionally allowed them up to make examples of them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4066"><span>When the stronger ones in the army are killed without being able to defend themselves, reality of the situation would lay out the in front of the others. The weaker Majins would witness this and lose their morale. The survivors would understand the difference in power between the enemy and themselves, losing their last bit of strength to struggle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4067"><span>These nature of these traps are a stage set-up in order to successfully capture captives.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4068"><span>Ten minutes passed after the fight began and the situation is one-sided. The enemy is unable to reverse the situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4069"><span>「T-to have gone to this extent…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4070"><span>Below them, Clayman’s army with more than ten-thousand people are split off to chunks with countless fallen into traps. The Yellow Corps led by Geld are responsible for fortifying the edges of the caves. The members of the corp spread out in evenly around the traps to take care of any Majin that attempted climbed up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4071"><span>The ones who are cut off can’t fight against the many enemies above. Although the difference in power may be compensated by number and equipments.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4072"><span>But the more powerful Majins have been taken out one by one at the hands of the Beastmen warriors and members of the 「Kurenai」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4073"><span>It is even more unfortunate that most of Clayman’s army has attacked the plain with an open view. Even the remaining troops with around a thousand men awaiting order (cannot participate) won’t be sufficient to reverse the situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4074"><span>「We are guaranteed to win.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4075"><span>「S-sasuga…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4076"><span>Benimaru says naturally while <span data-term="Alvis" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> expresses praise from her heart.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4077"><span>「Heh, of course we will win.

Moreover, since we are winning, aren’t the enemies all fleeing?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4098"><span>「Ha! Our army is indeed winning. But just to be cautious to prevent the situation from being reversed, we’ve got to suppressed the forces on the back.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4099"><span>「I see, understood!

This scene often plays out in life.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4103"><span>Suphia smiles upon seeing such a scene. Her fighting spirits gradually grow high as she faces towards the enemy in front.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4104"><span>Midley has positioned his force in the safe zone behind the back</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4105"><span>They aren’t exactly a military force, but instead they became part of the support team at the back. It would be more accurate to call them the medical squad that is operating away from the battlefield.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4106"><span>They didn’t volunteer to enter the battlefield, but the notion of being looked down by others would make Midley too ashamed to see Milim again.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4107"><span>If that’s the case, even MIlim-sama would be looked down upon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4108"><span>Midley felt anxious about it and propose that they join the frontline as well. Yet Yamza rejected his proposal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4109"><span>It’s obvious that he does not care for Midley and his party, instead, he simply doesn’t wish to share his victory with anyone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4110"><span>Surely the conquest this time would be successful.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4111"><span>The enemy is only one third of Yamza’s army, a band of loose troops at that. There is no way they can launch a counter-attack while trying to protect the retreating refugees.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4112"><span>It doesn’t feel honorable to be fighting this type of opponents….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4113"><span>Midley changed his mind &nbsp;these few days went by.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4114"><span>However, the situation has took an unexpected turn.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4115"><span>「Midley-sama, this is really bad…….

So Demon Lord Clayman’s subordinates are that weak….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4117"><span>「No no no, it’s not like that! The enemies have outsmarted us with tactics!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4118"><span>「What! You idiot, if the enemy resorted to tactics, all we have to do it’s to beat them with our true power! The only reason why you are saying these weak things is because you are still too inexperienced, Hermes!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4119"><span>「I’ve said already! It’s a different case if we are talking about a duel, but when it is a wide-scale battle with armies, the tactics will determine the outcome of the battle! This include how to trick and outsmart the enemies. Our opponents have won this time. They’ve been hiding their strength until key moments and have prepared traps.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4120"><span>「Huh, no one needs you to explain that, anyone who’s seen the battle would know!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4121"><span>Midley replies so while giving a snort of contempt.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4122"><span>He is no good with brainwork. While in contrast, Hermes a little clever, that’s why he often says things Midley finds hard to understand. Midley is quite upset about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4123"><span>But, consider how things have developed——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4124"><span>He is on no grounds to argue back. Even Midley knows Hermes is right.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4125"><span>The sight in front of them is the best proof of that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4126"><span>「More importantly, Midley-sama——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4127"><span>「I know. Those people are closing in on us and they are strong. Even though I don’t want to fight, we are on the battlefield after all.

He soon discovers the people hidden some distance away from the battlefield. Then he jumps in front of them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4135"><span>They are the man with the angry jester mask and the girl with the tearing jester mask.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4136"><span>This bizarre duo is —— 「Angry Clown (Angry Pierrot)」 Footman, 「Tearing Clown (Teardrop)」 Tear.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4137"><span>They are members of the Moderate Jester Association who are surveillancing the battlefield at Clayman’s request.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4138"><span>「Hey, thanks for taking care me before.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4139"><span>Phobio suppresses his anger and speaks up calmly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4140"><span>「What’s this? Isn’t this Phobio-sama!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4141"><span>Behind the angry jester masks, a pair of evil eyes are glowing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4142"><span>「It’s Demon-Lord-wannabe Phobio-sama, lost-to-Milim Phobio-sama! Thanks for your help back then! 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4143"><span>The girl wearing tearing jester mask mocks at Phobio, looking down on him hard while greeting him while spinning and singing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4144"><span>「Hey, it’s great that you both remember me. It would be really sad if you don’t even know why you’ll die at my hands!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4145"><span>「Eheheh? What are you angry at?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4146"><span>「How strange. What is this baka angry at? That angry emotion smells very tasty, but it isn’t enough reason to kill us.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4147"><span>「Right, right!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4148"><span>「Cut the nonsense! I may be an idiot for being tricked by others, but an idiot has an idiot’s way. I don’t need a reason to get my revenge!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4149"><span>It’s a matter of dignity. Phobio unleashes his sharp claws.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4150"><span>Those claws are so dark as to shine, and are also sharp and ferocious like wolfs’ teeth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4151"><span>However, Tear and Footman didn’t seem to react even seeing his claws.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4152"><span>「Oh~Do you want to fight us? But you are so weak, better not get ahead of yourself!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4153"><span>「He——hehehe. I’m dying here, Tear. Phobio-sama come here specially to joke around, trying make us laugh.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4154"><span>The two goes on with their chat, but that didn’t lead Phobio to lose his cool.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4155"><span>He failed once because he was too easily angered. He’s done more self reflection on the matter more than anyone and with much regrets.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4156"><span>So he begins his action at once as if announcing that greeting time is over.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4157"><span>He &nbsp;breaks into a run and closes in on the enemies at high speed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4158"><span>「——Oh!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4159"><span>「Ze!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4160"><span>Footman and Tear changes their attitudes now knowing words won’t irritate him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4161"><span>Besides——There has been an intervention.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4162"><span>As the space begins to warp, a man shaped like a pig walks in from mid-air.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4163"><span>「Long time no see, Footman. Do you remember me?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4164"><span>「Oh? Oh my? What an honor it is to have the orc general arrive here. Wow, you’ve really grown handsome!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4165"><span>Footman speaks with mockery, yet his expression is not as relaxed as his words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4166"><span>In contrast to how he looks, Footman is good at mind games.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4167"><span>But Geld has seen through his true personality.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4168"><span>When his troops destroyed Benimaru and his companions’ hometown——Tribe of Ogre, the one who accompanied them was Footman. Geld knew then already that he is not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4169"><span>Footman is unlike any other normal Majin, Geld thinks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4170"><span>Plus that Tear is also present as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4171"><span>She’s around Footman’s level. Since her true strength is unknown, this opponent cannot be underestimated .</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4172"><span>Even if the Beastketeer from Beast King Warrior Army,「Black Panther Tooth」 Phobio, has very strong ability, he would still have a hard time dealing with both Footman and Tear alone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4173"><span>Hehe, as expected of Benimaru-san, these people are worthy of being my prey.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4174"><span>As he thinks that, Geld is also extremely eager.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4175"><span>Benimaru learnt of the situation from above and ordered him to assist Phobio. Geld was originally frowning since the order required him to give up his commanding post on the battlefield, but only now did he realizes how accurate Benimaru’s prediction was.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4176"><span>The outcome on that battlefield is already settled, even Geld’s adjutant could handle things there. But in order to take on the duo from Moderating Jester Association, it would be a challenging task that only the veterans under Rimuru could handle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4177"><span>「Allow me to assist you, Phobio-dono.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4178"><span>「Oh oh, Geld-san. Thanks for the help!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4179"><span>Phobio has also calmly judged the difference in strength between him and his opponents, that is likely why he didn’t refuse Geld’s proposition. He’d rather put down his ego knowing what his limits are and choose &nbsp;the easiest path to win against his opponents.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4180"><span>As such, in the dark side of the small hill next to the battlefield, the two parties would soon engage in their battle——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4181"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4182"><span>Upon receiving reports coming from the battlefields, Yamza has lost his footing.

He has been tricked all over the place and exhausted as he swings around his spear.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4644"><span>Midley has been the two’s opponents all this time. He doesn’t seem tired at all, rather he looks very energetic. These two are a piece of cake compared to sparring with Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4645"><span>And Midley is also the first to notice the situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4646"><span>「Everyone, I approve you all of using healing magic!

Come on, get everyone up right now!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4647"><span>He no longer looks as calm as he shouts out furiously.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4648"><span>「This is bad Midley-sama! From the reaction it seems to be quite the monstrosity.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4649"><span>「I know! That is probably the Charybdis that Mililm-sama just defeated recently. No, or is it its remains?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4650"><span>「It looks like so…… But it doesn’t seem quite stable, even without our interference, it will probably disappear in about a day…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4651"><span>「No, this is the battlefield. It may have some unforeseen development if we are not cautious. We’d better not feed anything to a monster like that.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4652"><span>Midley and Hermes who’s been suddenly healed have entered their own worlds and converses all over the place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4653"><span>Right now, the priests on the ground </span><span>begin</span><span>&nbsp;to cast healing magic, not only on themselves, but also helping to heal Gabiru’s subordinates from 「Hiryuu」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4654"><span>「Do you mean Charybdis? That monster that possessed baka Phobio! Didn’t Demon Lord Milim destroy it already?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4655"><span>「Indeed, Charybdis has already been eliminated by Milim-sama…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4656"><span>Suphia and Gabiru also join the discussion. They don’t think it’s the right time to be stubborn about winning or losing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4657"><span>「Calm down everyone. That isn’t the real deal, more like the fragments of its power. And it seems to have used Yamza as substitute for its 『Core』....」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4658"><span>Midley activates his 「Dragon Eye」 and begins to analyze the nature of the thing to explain to everyone. It is not as effective as Milim’s 「Dragon Eye」, but it is still a great skill with the abilities of 「Vision」 and 「Analysis」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4659"><span>Hermes is not just sitting around either, he’s guarding the surrounding in case of emergency.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4660"><span>「That should be it. I was planning to kill that bastard Yamza, but his soul has been eaten clean. With how things have developed, all we can do is try to reduce casualty and wait for it to die out by itself.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4661"><span>He concludes calmly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4662"><span>「Have you guys heard what I said? I permit everyone to gear up to prepare for battle. But don’t get greedy. We are just buying time to come up with a solution against it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4663"><span>「Let us help as well. We are much more skilled in high speed flying compared to last time. We won’t get injured as long as we watch the scale attack.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4664"><span>Midley and Gabiru are like old friends. The two decides to collaborate with much tacit bonds. The mad Charybdis has one habit of chasing things that move. Gabiru’s party can fly and is the best bait for it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4665"><span>Suphia is also contemplating, her brain is running much faster than usual. She decides to do whatever she can and immediately takes actions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4666"><span>「Alright, in order to prevent it from consuming any ground troops, I’ll assist everyone to retreat——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4667"><span>But she couldn’t finish her sentence before things took a quick turn.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4668"><span>It is when Benimaru happened to incinerate Charybdis.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4669"><span>「Wh…..What…..! That guy didn’t even flinch while carrying out such spectacle!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4670"><span>「——What the hell? Is that a Demon Lord? It would make sense if it’s MIlim-sama, but how can a single Majin be capable of that? What a monster…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4671"><span>Only two people saw it first-hand, Midley and Hermes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4672"><span>Suphia, Gabiru also noticed the difference, but they are aware of the situation. All they knew was that the evil aura of the Charybdis dissipated instantly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4673"><span>「OI, what happened? Could you tell me as well!?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4674"><span>「Hmm. I was hoping you two would help explain to us.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4675"><span>「About that, I want to do it as well….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4676"><span>「But it seems unnecessary.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4677"><span>Hermes and Midley couldn’t begin to explain before the space before <span data-term="Suphia" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Gabiru begins to twist and till. A Majin with red hair, akin to burning fire appears before them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4678"><span>It’s Benimaru with his tachi on his shoulder.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4679"><span>Benimaru has come here to deal with the last dangerous individual on the battlefield——Midley.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4680"><span>「Hey, it seems our men have been taken under your care.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4681"><span>Benimaru arrives to stare intensely at Midley, but he soon realizes things were amiss. There are traces of fights at the scene, yet there are no injured. The tension that was just about to break out now ceases to exist.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4682"><span>「Wait a second, Benimaru-sama! These people are Milim-sama’s subordinates. The Priest Warrior from the Worshippers of Dragon.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4683"><span>「What, Milim-sama’s subordinates? That means——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4684"><span>「Our wounds are healed by their healing magic too!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4685"><span>「........ I see. I suppose I’ve thought too much. You’ve really raised my alert high since you are the toughest opponent to deal with on this battlefield.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4686"><span>「WHAHAHAHA, you wasn’t thinking it wrong. Our troop did fight yours. And it’s also true that we’ve healed your wounds, but that is for the coming battle against the bigger trouble. Right now there is no longer this necessity.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4687"><span>「——I see. Then what should we do next? Do you wish to fight us?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4688"><span>「About that, what to do now…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4689"><span>「We don’t actually want to fight Milim-sama’s subordinates either.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4690"><span>「Hmm, that’s right. Even though I want to have a spar with you, but it’s not to antagonize you. But instead to see who’s stronger in terms of strength.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4691"><span>「So that’s how it is, I understand your sentiments.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4692"><span>Midley and Benimaru both smiles as they finish their words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4693"><span>「Eh, HOLD ON——! This isn’t appropriate!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4694"><span>「Right, Benimaru-sama! If you harmed Milim-sama’s subordinates, there is no guarantee how much hell she would rain on us!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4695"><span>「That’s right, Midley-sama! Rimuru-sama and Milim-sama are friends, it would lead to a catastrophe!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4696"><span>Hermes and Gabiru moves out to stop the two, while <span data-term="Suphia" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who was trying to interject has to shut up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4697"><span>「I know. Besides, if we really get serious in the fight, I’ll most likely lose.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4698"><span>Benimaru decides to step up with the addition of 「I don’t plan to fight without the chance to win.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4699"><span>「WHAHAHAHA, nice saying. But if you are able to kill that Charybdis, even someone as strong as me wouldn’t be absolutely sure in defending against your attack.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4700"><span>Midley follows it up with his laughter, with those words said, he seems confident in preventing benimaru from using the skills he used to win against Charybdis. It would definitely render the fight into a life-or-death brawl rather than a relaxing spar.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4701"><span>It would be too strange to spar on this battlefield, and besides, the incentive to fight against each other has long gone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4702"><span>On top of that, none of the side has the intention of doing the fight.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4703"><span>Just like that, at this location——The battle that took place at the ruins of the Orc Kingdom Ocby concludes with the overwhelming victory of the united army.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4704"><span>Apart from this, there is another battlefield out there, there also——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4705"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4706"><span>The time is midnight twelve o’clock. Shuna, Souei and Hakurou begin their operation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4707"><span>Across the wetland masked by thick fog, there lies the Clayman’s headquarter ahead. They intend to go there as they secretly intrude the wetland.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4708"><span>There are many suspicious swamps in the wetland with sound of biogas popping off. These biogas seems to be the cause of the fogs, adding a sense of creepiness to its surrounding.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4709"><span>As soon as they intrude into the wetland, a thick layer of mist begins to emerge in front their eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4710"><span>「This is not good. My 『Magic Perception』 has been affected by the fog.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4711"><span>「Indeed. This is the reason why I’ve given up my investigation. My visions here are greatly limited and I could only rely on my five senses to collect intels. On the contrary, the enemies seem to be collecting intelligence using the fog.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4712"><span>「So that’s how it is, in other words, the situation is highly against us.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4713"><span>「Yes. Hakurou-sama should be fine and I could also use skill 『Stealth』 to conceal my presence. However, Shuna-sama would——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4714"><span>As Souei said, Hakurou could use his esoteric invisibility technique 「Haziness」 to completely hide his presence. Souei can also achieve perfect stealth that causing one unable to detect him even if he’s right next to them. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4715"><span>「I’ll be fine as well.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4716"><span>Shuna is faced with the biggest challenge, but Souei’s concerns seem to be unwarranted. Shuna also erases her traces and conceals her perfectly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4717"><span>「Oh, so it works just like my 『Haziness』. It seems to be a combined skill of 『Illusion Magic』 and 『Witchery』. As expected of Shuna-sama.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4718"><span>Hakurou is correct, that is the unique skill invented by Shuna. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4719"><span>Although unable to rival Rimuru, Shuna can create unique magic through her unique skill 「Creator」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4720"><span>「It seems that the issue has been resolved. But do still be cautious, as you can’t use 『Telepathy Net』 as long as you remain in the sea of fog. The vision is not clear and communication is difficult, so you guys must be careful with every step you take</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;This is an idiom 一歩一歩をかためて進む" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>. Also, here’s something for you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4721"><span>In this sea of fog, even with Souei’s 「Clone」 to connect the them, they can’t communicate through 「Telepathy Net」. So Souei wants Hakurou and Shuna to hold on to 「Sticky Steel Web」 as method of emergency contact.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4722"><span>Through the vibration of the web, they can make some bare communication with each other. However, once the web is broken they will lose the method to contact, so they must be cautious with its usage. Shuna and Hakurou nod and carefully wrap the web around their wrists.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4723"><span>That concludes the preparation work.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4724"><span>「Let’s head out.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4725"><span>Shuna launches the journey as the three begin to move out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4726"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4727"><span>「——This is bad, we seem to have walked into a trap.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4728"><span>With only a few minutes set out, Shuna stops to say.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4729"><span>「A trap?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4730"><span>「I’ve also getting a mixed feel from the surrounding, almost as if there are presences of enemies——What’s that!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4731"><span>Souei couldn’t finish his sentence when he senses an unknown and overwhelming aura suddenly surrounds him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4732"><span>「I can’t believe this…… They’ve got many people, how could I have not sensed it, where have they been hiding?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4733"><span>「No, Hakurou! The enemies have not shown, but we have been lured to this location!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4734"><span>「Is that so, it must be this fog. Not only did this fog caused us to lose direction, it also hid our enemies’ presence and lured us into the center of this encirclement of trap….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4735"><span>「So that is how it was, this is the reason why I’ve been feeling strange from the start.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4736"><span>「Indeed, Souei, Hakurou. This fog has triggered 『Dimensional Interference』. No matter where the enemies attack us from, it will always lead them back to a certain location—— 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4737"><span>Halfway through Shuna’s explanation, someone has already rushed out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4738"><span>Souei and Hakurou are maintaining their guards against the concealed </span><span>monster</span><span>s near their surrounding and at the same time, displays a battle posture against the person that suddenly appeared.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4739"><span>Shuna also remains silent as she looks at the person.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4740"><span>A skeleton wearing white clergy coat——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4741"><span>That is the person who appeared before Shuna’s party.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4742"><span>「Such strong mana…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4743"><span>Shuna whispers with cold sweat on her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4744"><span>She thought and panicked for a moment thinking that it was Clayman himself, but he quickly rejected that idea.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4745"><span>It’s already past midnight twelve o’clock, Clayman has long set out for the Walpurgis Banquet. If that’s the case, the logical deduction would be that this is one of the member of Clayman’s close lieutenants, a member of the 「Five Fingers」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4746"><span>Right now this individual not only can rival the strength of the Beastketeers, his power is closing in to that of Demon Lord. That is how much magicules this Majin possesses.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4747"><span>What’s also unbelievable to Shuna is why such a person would want to work under others.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4748"><span>And Shuna then recalls a thing that <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mentioned to her. The member of Clayman’s 「Five Fingers」 who is responsible for defending the castle is——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4749"><span>「——I see, you must be Adalman. The ruler of this land——The Undead King who leads many undead </span><span>monster</span><span>s.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4750"><span>Hakurou, through his 「Eyes of Heaven」</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;This is more akin to “Eyes of Sky”, the heaven here has no religious sense." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;also reached the same conclusion just as Shuna described.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4751"><span>Adalman’s immense and ominous power is far greater than what <span data-term="Myuran" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> described. This is the Undead King who can rival a Demon Lord, he is the protector of this land.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4752"><span>Souei wouldn’t doubt Shuna and Hakurou’s, reaching the intended conclusion as it is meant to be reached. He concentrate his killing intent quietly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4753"><span>Whoever this foe is, I’ll kill him——That’s the logic of Souei’s action.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4754"><span>At that moment, Souei prepares for action.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4755"><span>「Indeed, I am Adalman. Guardian of this land and servant to the order of the great Demon Lord Clayman-sama. Lowly intruders, prepare to die. If you follow my order, I shall grant you all a painless death.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4756"><span>Undead King——Adalman proclaims.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4757"><span>That is an order from a king. Those words indicate that he is not considering enemies such as Shuna as an equal to him. But it is reasonable to be terrified at the hugh possession of magicules Adalman holds.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4758"><span>It would seem that due to the presence of his seemingly infinite magicules, tens of thousands of undead </span><span>monster</span><span>s begin to emerge from the surrounding.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4759"><span>Godagodagodagoda, giligiligiligili *spooky skeleton sounds* they begin to make sharp noises as they surround Shuna’s party.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4760"><span>「So it’s true, we’ve been completely surrounded by the enemies. This fog is combined with 『Coordination Barrier』, we can’t use 『Dimensional Transportation』 to escape. All means of communication have been interfered, we can only break out of the encirclement by defeating Adalman.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4761"><span>Shuna informs them without hesitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4762"><span>Basically, Hakurou and Souei would never just take Adalman’s suggestion without a fight. Hearing Shuna’s suggestion, the two strike out together without a discussion. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4763"><span>「No time to waste, let’s take down the enemy general.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4764"><span>「I agree. One it is struck by my techniques, even the dead can’t escape their fate.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4765"><span>The two make such response as they close in on Adalman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4766"><span>Seeing the two striking towards him, Adalman gives off a disdaining smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4767"><span>「Hehehe, a bunch of arrogant fools. How silly of me to have wished to offer you my mercy. Since you won’t even be grateful to my proposition, I shall let you taste the consequences and regret your decision.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4768"><span>Adalman swings his giant hand as if he still has much strength to spare.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4769"><span>Immediately afterward, something astounding occurs. Hakurou’s knife closing in on the enemy was stopped by a knight in front of Adalman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4770"><span>Hakurou deeply believed that that strike would have taken his enemy’s life. He backs off while being shocked.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4771"><span>That knight is a Rank A- </span><span>monster</span><span>, Undead Knight.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4772"><span>However, that strike has had Hakurou discovered something amiss. Even if it’s a powerful </span><span>monster</span><span>, a single Undead Knight won’t be able to stop Hakurou’s knife.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4773"><span>「You are no common foe. Very well, I shall use my real skills to spar with you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4774"><span>Hakurou was right.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4775"><span>He has realized the strength of this Undead Knight.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4776"><span>It is not skills derived from the bodily strength of </span><span>monster</span><span>, but from human skills gained through the hardship of training.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4777"><span>Then, it won’t be the simple type to be seen through by 「Eyes of Heaven」. That’s why Hakurou has devoted himself to duel his Undead Knight.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4778"><span>「............」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4779"><span>The Undead Knight remains silent. He can’t talk with hie temporary body made up of dead corpse.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4780"><span>However, you can see the blue white flame shaking in its hollow eye sacks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4781"><span>That is undoubtedly the light of will.

Grant me thy holy power and listen to my wishes——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4947"><span>With the outburst of emotion, Adalman begins to chant.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4948"><span>Indeed. It is because my resolve is not thorough enough. My companions who admire me were turned into undead </span><span>monster</span><span>s and I couldn’t just leave them behind….. It was I who was naive. 「Undead Magic」 and 「Elemental-based Magic」 couldn’t purify undead </span><span>monster</span><span>s. But if I continue to pray in hope of casting 「Holy Magic」, it may actually…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4949"><span>If anything, the reason why Adalman was trapped and bonded by this land was due to his companions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4950"><span>They died on this land and became the cursed dead. Adalman couldn’t let him behind. This thought alone has bonded him with this terrain.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4951"><span>Now Adalman finally realizes how wrong he was.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4952"><span>He raises his two skeleton hands and draws out complicated spell patterns while reciting prayer to god.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4953"><span>These are curse spells, the proof being the complicated geometric shapes that emerged before Adalman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4954"><span>Shuna, right? I don’t hate you. Moreover, you’ve helped me to clear up my mind. I very much appreciate that. However, I can’t just commit suicide. So I’m sorry that you’ll have to come along with me to death——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4955"><span>Adalman apologizes to Shuna in his heart.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4956"><span>There are still many levels of highly imposing forces of Demon Lord Kazaream that bonds Adalman. That’s why even suicide is not allowed. But with that being said, it’s a different case to be killed by the remaining shock wave of the attack launched at the enemies.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4957"><span>He plans to kill Shuna as well as himself. In this way, his companions that have been affected by him could finally be set free…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4958"><span>As of now, many layers of magical circles gradually unfold around Shuna and Adalman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4959"><span>「——I call forth the destruction of all beings! 『Disintegration』!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4960"><span>「I was waiting for that! 『Overdrive』!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4961"><span>As soon as Adalman cast his spell, Shuna utilized her unique skill 「Analyzer」 to carry out「Law Manipulation」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4962"><span>It resulted in the spirit particles gathered by Adalman to no longer be in his grasp and begins to go out of control.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4963"><span>「W-What? Your magicule possession is less than one tenth of me, yet you could overwrite my magic——!!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4964"><span>Magicule and Spiritual particles all operate based on magic. In terms of overdrive magic, there is no other explanation but that Shuna’s magic ability is above that of Adalman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4965"><span>In Adalman’s view, Shuna has not been a worthy opponent at all. Now he realizes again that he has misjudged.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4966"><span>「Very impressive. To reward you, I shall severe you cursed bond with this land!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4967"><span>SHuna didn’t listen to him till the end as overflowing light begins to consume Adalman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4968"><span>Shuna has exploited Adulman’s magic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4969"><span>When confronted with Adalman who is a much competent use of Holy Magic than her, he holds sufficient power to purify this entire land. Shuna didn’t expect him to release the most powerful Holy Magic spell, but thankfully she knew the origin of that magic and overwrite it with ease.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4970"><span>On this land, where that shine of light is omnipresent, it consumed all undead </span><span>monster</span><span>s including Adalman and purifies them…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4971"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_4972"><span>Hakurou and Souei come before Shuna.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4973"><span>「Oh well, I was trying to get a result early, but that Undead Knight is surprisingly skillful. Shuna-sama has saved my life.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4974"><span>Adalman was defeated and the land was purified. The Undead Knight devolved to a skeleton swordsman and was rendered incapable of moving. It would seem that the Undead Knight is under the order of Adalman to cease combating.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4975"><span>Upon seeing his look, Hakurou knew that his duel has concluded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4976"><span>It is a shame that he wasn’t able to come to a result against an opponent, long awaited by him, who would require Hakurou to fight with his real abilities. But right now protecting Shuna is the more important thing. Hakurou knew the priority of things and immediately went back before Shuna.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4977"><span>「No, I’m lucky that Hakurou is here. If it’s me, I won’t be able to defeat the Undead Knight. Souei as well, your opponent was an Undead Dragon yet you were able to win some time. Had that dragon been causing rampaged all over the place, we would not have been able to win this battle.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4978"><span>「No, I couldn’t strike it down. I am deeply ashamed.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4979"><span>Just as Souei said, the Undead Dragon was a strong enemy. Its wounds would recover immediately if they are not deep enough. Once you come in contact with its Youki, your mind would also be contaminated.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4980"><span>Souei was only able to retreat with several 「Clones」 operated at the same time. He should be praised however that he was able to stall the Undead Dragon that he has no way of beating.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4981"><span>That Undead Dragon was also defeated after Adalman’s fall. It maintained its shape through Adalman’s magicule, and was no longer able to maintain its body afterward.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4982"><span>Souei personally couldn’t accept the result, but surviving alone is a victory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4983"><span>With the being said…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4984"><span>The three look at each other awkwardly and sigh together.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4985"><span>「Speaking of which, if that Adalman fought us seriously from the start, we would have been killed. I was so mad that I may have overdone things.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4986"><span>In fact, Adalman didn’t intentionally hold back or play any dirty tricks. If he truly intended to Kill Shuna and the rest, there must be other available methods.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4987"><span>Shuna saw through it and began he self-reflection.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4988"><span>「That’s right, we may have become boastful after gaining power.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4989"><span>「Indeed. Rimuru-sama’s worries were warranted as he said that the situation of the battlefield may alter in an instant. I should have collected more intelligences.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4990"><span>The three speak up and reflect for their arrogance.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4991"><span>But regardless, they were able to triumph.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4992"><span>Clayman’s headquarter has lost its key defending members.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4993"><span>But, things are not done yet. Shuna and the rest still have work to do.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4994"><span>They must take down Clayman’s castle and completely paralyze it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4995"><span>The majority of people remaining in the castle are non-combatants who aren’t loyal to Clayman. These are sensible people who were hired by money and they don’t intend to resist.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4996"><span>The rest are mainly forced into bonds with Clayman due to all sorts of reasons. Shuna not only persuaded them, she also helped to release them for their curses. Only a while later were they able to take over the castle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4997"><span>The Majins within the castle no longer posts a threat, Shuna’s party then begin to explore.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4998"><span>They’ve confirmed that Demon Lord <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not detained here. But the rest still wish to find evidence to get their hands on Clayman’s weakness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_4999"><span>As they are halfway through——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5000"><span>Shuna and the rest were exploring around as someone approaches to speak with them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5001"><span>「——please hold your step.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5002"><span>「Hmm? How is he still alive? Should we finish him?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5003"><span>「Hold up, Hakurou. This person no longer wishes to fight us.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5004"><span>The one came to talk was Adalman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5005"><span>Hakurou, who doesn’t dare to let down his guard was unsheathing his knife as Shuna stopped him calmly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5006"><span>「Shunan-sama——Please allow us to call you so. Thanks to your magic, we were able to leave this land, receive purification and survive. I believe this is fate in working, so we have one request to as of you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5007"><span>With a skeleton swordsman, Adalman, now an undead who has lost more than half of his power and kneeled and says.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5008"><span>「——What is it?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5009"><span>Shuna asks out of suspicion. It seems they have run into trouble again.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5010"><span>「Yes, much appreciated. In fact I want to see the one who Shuna-sama has place her faith in. I’ve lost my faith and my power will never reverse back to that of my prime. I no longer believe in the god Ruminas. That’s why I now look for a new god to server.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5011"><span>「「「..............」」」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5012"><span>Shuna and the rest were shocked and speechless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5013"><span>「Sh-should I call him god? I respect Rimuru-sama, but not to the point of serving as a god!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5014"><span>Shuna makes her bare response, but Adalman doesn’t mind. It won’t pose a problem to him so he continues to recommend himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5015"><span>「His name is Rimuru-sama, is it? What a splendid name, perfect for my new god. We may be fragile Undead </span><span>monster</span><span>s, but we’ll still be of use in some way. Shuna-sama, could you introduce and recommend us to Rimuru-sama.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5016"><span>Unconditional, undoubting faith seems very different from respect for someone——Shuna was going to explain towards that end but gave up the thought seeing it may turn too troublesome.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5017"><span>It’s alright. When he sees Rimuru-sama’s true identity, he may quit at the sight of the challenge.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5018"><span>Upon recalling how Rimuru’s cute and soft look he usually displays, Shuna comes to that conclusion and decides to let things flow as it goes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5019"><span>Adalman also seems very stubborn about his opinion. So persuading him would take too much time, it’d be better to just let him do what he wants.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5020"><span>As such, Adalman and the thousands of survivors that are the undead </span><span>monster</span><span>s under his rule——If anything, have all been dead——are now under Shuman’s command. The conquering of Clayman’s castle thus concludes here.</span></p><a id="line_5021" class="line"></a><h2 class="text-center strong line" id="line_5022"><span>Chapter 5</span></h2><p class="text-center line" id="line_5023"><span>Walpurgis Banquet </span></p><hr class="line" id="line_5024"><p class="line" id="line_5025"><span>There is a luxurious door in front of us.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5026"><span>Once through, we arrive at the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5027"><span>There is a huge roundtable in there with twelve chairs spaced out with equal intervals.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5028"><span>There is a total of ten Demon Lords with only <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> missing at the moment. That means there will be two more chairs even if I take one.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5029"><span>Misery leads me to my seat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5030"><span>It seems that we will be seated according to the chronological order of becoming a Demon Lord. So I will sit on the furthest side, namely the back seat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5031"><span>I make no objection and decide to check out my surroundings as it is a rare opportunity for me to observe all the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5032"><span>Speaking of which, there are only two people present at the moment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5033"><span>One of which is Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5034"><span>She appears to have the most seniority and gets to sit in the top seat. She has been swinging her feet happily for some time..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5035"><span>It’s no different from a kid, so I’ll ignore her for now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5036"><span>From my point of view, on Ramiris’ right sits a seductive red-haired man who is on the opposite side of me——He is indeed a man, yet, his appearance is eerily charming. The handsome specimen just sits there casually.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5037"><span>Both of his eyes are closed but he probably isn’t asleep.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5038"><span>You can easily tell that this guy is far from simple.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5039"><span>I activate 「Analysis」 yet his stats don’t seem to be out of place. But my instinct tells me that this person is abnormal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5040"><span>He has similar magicule count as <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, just on a different wavelength.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5041"><span>In other words, you could mistaken him to really be green and can’t even know &nbsp;control his aura with that amount of magicules.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5042"><span>But, he can’t fool my eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5043"><span>I guess, if it is the analysis skill of 「Great Sage」 that is put into this situation would probably be deceived all over the place. That is how he has cleverly disguised his information.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5044"><span>He is misleading opponents to misjudge his strength by showing them false information. This is a contest even before the actual fight breaks out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5045"><span>Now that I recall, I’ve got a mind-reading skill just like Dwarf King Gazel.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5046"><span>My 「Great Sage」 is probably just like those skills, that other people would not be able to know its true capability without I actively lay out my cards and inform them of the skill. It would be a different case if the opponent has「Mind Reading」 ability that can read one’s deep subconscious. One would probably only come to the realization of such skill after being manipulated and exploited. But unless one fails to resist, it shouldn’t have an effect at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5047"><span>That’s why it is important to conceal skills at times.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5048"><span>It may act as a bluff when the opponents learn about your skill.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5049"><span>If you really have it yet intentionally try to hide it, it will raise people’s suspicion anyway.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5050"><span>That’s what this handsome (beautiful) man is doing right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5051"><span>He has deceived others’ 「Analysis」 to raises their suspicion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5052"><span>I personally believe there is a necessity to hide my power. That means to completely suppress my aura in order to prevent giving any information to the enemies, I think that would be the meaningful move.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5053"><span>On the contrary, what this guy is doing, he can instead reads the analyzer’s power. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_5054"><span>To filter his opponents.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5055"><span>First he would see if the opponent has the ability to extract intel. To put aside those incapable of the skill, once he encounters someone who is capable of doing so, he can observe the opponents’ reaction just like that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5056"><span>If the opponent would even fear of his illusive disguise, he won’t even put the opponent on his mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5057"><span>If he encounters someone who realizes he is faking, he will send the message that his power is so immeasurable that his opponents won’t dare antagonize him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5058"><span>And putting that aside for a moment, even with the false message he sends out, he displays a similar magicule possession as <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5059"><span>His real power is completely incalculable. Since now I understand what he’s playing, I’d better stay away from any trouble with him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5060"><span>The person clearly on a different level with me——The man known as「Guy」. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_5061"><span>Soon after my observation of Guy, another powerful man walks into the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5062"><span>He is alone without any company.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5063"><span>His presence by itself is imposing enough. That man must be the Demon Lord Dagruel the Titan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5064"><span>He takes the seat one chair next to the right of Guy without hesitation, lowering down to his seat &nbsp;with much majesty. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_5065"><span>In other words, does that empty seat (in between) belong to Milim? </span></p><p class="line" id="line_5066"><span>I look towards Dagruel.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5067"><span>Although Guy is already very tall himself, Dagruel somehow seems even much bigger than him. Unexpectedly, his luxurious chair is able to adjust according to the man’s size and is able to fit for Dagruel. It would seem everything in this room is some type of extravagant magical device.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5068"><span>This Demon Lord was once the arch rival of Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5069"><span>His imposing looks are truly impressive, enough to admit that he is a worthy opponent of a &nbsp;「True Dragon」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5070"><span>Speaking of this Demon Lord Dagruel, his magicule level is through the roof.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5071"><span>It’s unknown when comparing him to Veldora, that who would have the edge in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5072"><span>I can tell he has almost immeasurable amount of magicules, but I won’t be able to give it an accurate reading unless seeing him in combat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5073"><span>However, quality is more important than quantity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5074"><span>No need to get so scared just because he has a bit more magicules.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5075"><span>It’s more important when it comes to how you utilize your strength most effectively. Combat depends on the quality of one’s skill.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5076"><span>This Demon Lord Dagruel seems quite skillful, so I should be on guard with him anyhow…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5077"><span>After observing Dagruel, another Demon Lord shows up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5078"><span>It’s a handsome, fit man in sumptuous clothes. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_5079"><span>Although he’s not as tall as Dagruel, he’s still above average. His facial features are stern and delicate.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5080"><span>His short curly blonde hair has a wild quality to it that reflects his energetic and aggressive personality.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5081"><span>To make a more straightforward metaphor, this man with his dazzling appearance looks a bit like a movie star.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5082"><span>Somehow I get the impression that he must be good at charming people.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5083"><span>The two fangs sticking out of his mouth are most eye-catching.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5084"><span>He must be a Vampire——meaning, this man is the Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5085"><span>Valentine sits down on Ramiris’ left.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5086"><span>Judging by the sequencing seats, this Demon Lord probably has the same level of seniority as Dagruel, both being ancient Demon Lords. It is said that the Vampire Demon Lord has been replaced before, it may just be that he has taken the place of his predecessor after that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5087"><span>Never mind, there’s no use keeping my mind on the order of seats.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5088"><span>Compared to that, something else has caught my eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5089"><span>That is Valentine’s servants.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5090"><span>The first one looks like an elderly male butler.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5091"><span>He must be some sort of master as he is not making a single movement like a statue.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5092"><span>He has a similar logic to me as to surpass all of his Youki in order to prevent being revealed of his true strength.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5093"><span>The second one is even more interesting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5094"><span>A very attractive and beautiful young girl with shining long silver hair.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5095"><span>Her skin is pure and shining while her gold-silver pupils give off a devilish glow of blue and red. She has a kind of seductive beauty, as if she’s halted her growth the very moment she was transiting from a girl to a woman has immortalized it forever.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5096"><span>She wears a dress similar to a maid outfit. Maids are all combat classes——By that theory, it quite likely that the girl is very strong…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5097"><span>That’s why I’m surprised that such powerful individuals are merely subordinates to another.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5098"><span>Another point worth mentioning is that this beautiful girl’s Youki is so immense that it is almost spilling out, which she’s actively allowing it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5099"><span>Hmm, wait a second?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5100"><span>As I cross eyes with that girl, something feels strange, yet I can’t describe it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5101"><span>Perhaps I am worrying too much, considering that the Youki leaking from her just randomly changes attributes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5102"><span>《Answer. 「Analysis」 result as following, Target’s magicule storage is much higher than Demon Lord Valentine.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5103"><span>Ah, of course.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5104"><span>I have no way to assess the total magicules of this girl, but only know that she’s got more than her master Demon Lord Valentine.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5105"><span>Her method of concealment is extremely clever and people unlike me, who don’t have an ultimate skill would not be able to see through.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5106"><span>Even with that being said, she has no intention of hiding it as well. Like Guy, she probably wants to see whether the rest would notice.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5107"><span>——If that’s the case, could this girl be the Demon Lord herself?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5108"><span>It’s possible that she is the retired ex-Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5109"><span>Her true identity would be the female vampire 「Milus」 that even Veldora recognizes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5110"><span>It is rumored that the last change in leadership was one thousand, five hundred years ago and the Demon Lords who know the details are less than a few.

I want to shout out, but hold back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5117"><span>Could this be the legendary syndrome of「My head hurts already and it’s getting intensified </span><span>send help</span><span>」?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5118"><span>If I am to seek salvation in mind, should I perhaps think in line of 「My life is complete by enraging and getting killed by this type of beauty」?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5119"><span>——No, I don’t want that type of salvation after all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5120"><span>I hope my relationship with Veldora won’t get exposed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5121"><span>If it does happen to be exposed, I hope I won’t be cleaning up his mess (D: “wiping his ass” is the original sentence) for him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5122"><span>I pray to myself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5123"><span>Afterward, some time has passed since I got into this situation before the fifth person enters.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5124"><span>He enters alone with drowsy, sleepy eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5125"><span>There are two swords sheathed at his belt and that’s all his equipment. How convenient.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5126"><span>Then, he opens his eyes to momentarily reveal their beautiful light blue colour. His dark purple hair looks dark in the room, with silver strands mixed within.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5127"><span>He looks rather young, almost like a high school student. He is quite handsome, but his sleepy eyes and lazy gestures reduce the appeal of his pretty face..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5128"><span>That guy wanders towards Ramiris and stops to greet her with his hand slightly raised.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5129"><span>「Morning——you are still tiny as ever.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5130"><span>「Do you want to pick a fight? How cocky have you got, Dino the noob?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5131"><span>The fifth one is Dino. I recall him to be the same kind of person as Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5132"><span>They aren’t really arguing, but more like a routine quarrel.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5133"><span>「Silly, you know I’ll win anyway, why would I look for you to fight.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5134"><span>「Oh——I see you’ve gotten tired of living. Today I’m feeling super good you know!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5135"><span>「No way. You look like you’ve shrunk. Have you grown smaller since the last time we met?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5136"><span>「I can’t help it! I’ve been reincarnating lately!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5137"><span>Ramiris once said that it would take a couple hundred years before she could grow up. After asking for details, I was informed that she was only reincarnated about fifty years ago.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5138"><span>With her saying that, Dino seems to realize.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5139"><span>「Oh, that’s why you look like this. Sounds pretty convenient. But, will the memories be carried over?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5140"><span>「Of course it will. But, my spirit will devolve because of my body. But it doesn’t matter since I’m the strongest. That’s why I need to let loose at times like this!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5141"><span>「Guy, Ramiris seems to want to say something.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5142"><span>「Baka! Are you an idiot! I know what to say to the right person! I’ve never even thought of beating down Guy in one punch! (one pun~)」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5143"><span>Seeing Dino trying to talk to the red-haired man, Ramiris immediately stops him. She begins to find excuses with her voice lowered to mumble her complaint.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5144"><span>She’s only good at words, and is super quick to change her stance.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5145"><span>And that red-hair dude, sounds like he is indeed Guy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5146"><span>He must be dangerous given how panicked Ramiris looks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5147"><span>Secretly, I take note that 「Guy is dangerous」. I once avoided danger with this type of miniscule diligence, so I can’t underestimate its usage.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5148"><span>In order to avoid provoking Guy, Ramiris and the rest only dare to whisper their conversation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5149"><span>The content seems to be related to Ramiris’ servants——Beretta and Treyni-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5150"><span>Ramiris is showing off big time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5151"><span>「Ehh? Why didn’t you come by yourself, how come you brought servants this time? Won’t I look uncool coming alone ?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5152"><span>「Huh huh, yep. Now I can get back from those Demon Lords who call me a shrimp and say I’m all alone without any love! Especially you! I’ll let you know how useless you are against these two!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5153"><span>「Right then, wanna try to let them fight against me? Would it be alright if I break them?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5154"><span>「Ah? You’d better not! If you break them, I’ll go tell Guy and let him punish you with his iron fists!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5155"><span>Part of that line sounds like a bluff.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5156"><span>Ramiris is just going to call for help without any shame.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5157"><span>「——I mean these two, they probably can put up a good fight, right? They look really strong now that I look more closely!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5158"><span>With Dino’s remark, Beretta and Treyni-san both nod quietly in agreement.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5159"><span>*Sigh* what a waste to give these subordinates to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5160"><span>「Right? Right! That’s true, that means I speak with greater authority now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5161"><span>Dino’s words greatly please her as Ramiris shows her dominance by raising her flat chat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5162"><span>But it was me who helped making them two. Never mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5163"><span>Beretta and Treyni-san remain silent.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5164"><span>They are both very competent servants.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5165"><span>Similarly, behind me, Shion is silent too——and sleeping. I hope she would learn something from those two.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5166"><span>Dino goes on to his own seat after the greeting, face slacked. His seat is next to Valentine. He seems like an ancient Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5167"><span>He ignores Valentine beside him and more surprisingly, starts to sleep on the table right away.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5168"><span>Valentine probably finds him extremely rude, but greetings between Demon Lords may be the actual anomaly here. Although Dino was running his mouth to tease Ramiris, his greeting to her may indeed be just an exception.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5169"><span>Dino seems very unmotivated.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5170"><span>It gives off the vibe of “Simply coming is enough”.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5171"><span>He doesn’t care about the atmosphere of the meeting, simply playing the part &nbsp;of a sloth. In a sense he is a contrarian of his own.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5172"><span>His disregard for everything in turn, reflects his potent strength that enables such actions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5173"><span>……. I’ll just consider that to be the case.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5174"><span>This guy also seems to have a blockade against analysis, his real power remains unknown.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5175"><span>I want to analyze him but instead he stares back with his eyes slightly lifted. He is indeed keeping his guard up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5176"><span>His interaction with Ramiris just before reflected his arrogant personality, so this guy can’t be underestimated after all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5177"><span>But, Dino did seem like he’s treating Ramiris well. If possible, I don’t want to antagonize him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5178"><span>Next, the Harpy Queen enters the meeting room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5179"><span>MIlim once mentioned her to me, she must be Demon Lord Frey.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5180"><span>Her aura (sex appeal) is overflowing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5181"><span>Her pair of breasts seem to have quite the air resistance, won’t she feel inconvenient during flights?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5182"><span>Oh no, I accidently went astray. I’m just a bit moved by how impactful her entry is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5183"><span>Speaking of Frey, she looks towards me from Milim's empty seat, and her eyes fall on me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5184"><span>The way she squinting at people is also so sexy….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5185"><span>Ahhhhhh, this is truly…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5186"><span>As she passes by me, her body fragrance also smells so good.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5187"><span>These thoughts keep swirling through &nbsp;my head, however, I sense a dangerous aura at my back. Obviously Shion is getting pissed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5188"><span>She’s found out that I was almost seduced, as expected of Shion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5189"><span>It would be a bad idea to make Shion get any angrier. I switch back to normal observation mode immediately.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5190"><span>Her magicules are nothing special. If I have to be honest, it’s even smaller than that of Shion and Benimaru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5191"><span>On that note, Shion’s magicule count is catching up to Valentine, so her magicules aren’t little at all. But its quality is the key. It would be too superficial to judge by its quantity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5192"><span>The qualities of the two are hard to be distinguish by their breast sizes——Eh, that doesn’t seem to be relevant. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_5193"><span>I suppose she must have a lot of hidden skills. She has a certain dangerous aura surrounding her, so it’s not too far-fetched.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5194"><span>That’s about all the information I can extract from Frey, but there’s one point worth pointing out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5195"><span>That is the servants around her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5196"><span>One of whom is a busty beauty who can rival Frey.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5197"><span>She still seems somewhat childish but her figure is still top notch.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5198"><span>The other person is a tough guy possessing similar magicule levels to Frey. It is likely a male Harpy given the giant eagle wings on his back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5199"><span>He’s quite small compared to Dagruel, but he is just as fit as Valentine.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5200"><span>His face is covered by a lion mask, rendering me unable to analyze him. But….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5201"><span>Lion?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5202"><span>《Answer. According to the deduction of 「Analysis」——》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5203"><span>There’s no way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5204"><span>This person is on a completely different wavelength than <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. There’s no way that’s him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5205"><span>Even if 「<span data-term="Wisdom King Raphael" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」 won’t tell me, I can deduce this easily.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5206"><span>《...............》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5207"><span>If he is indeed the missing <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he definitely wouldn’t resort to such a disguise full of flaws to the Walpurgis Banquet. He would have been more careful and cautious.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5208"><span>Someone once said that there will be three people in the world who looks similar to oneself</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;This is a Japanese saying “世の中、自分に似た人間が三人居る” (In this world, there are three persons who’re similar to you).

Frey’s servant must be someone else.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5209"><span>After observing Frey’s group, I suddenly have the illusion that freezing wind is blowing into the room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5210"><span>I look towards that direction and witness the entry of a blonde beauty.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5211"><span>It is a beauty blessed with endorsement of gods.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5212"><span>Such a beauty walks straight towards me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5213"><span>「——Are you Rimuru?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5214"><span>「That’s right——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5215"><span>That’s right, and who are you——I intend to ask back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5216"><span>I don’t know this type of gorgeous beauty. But upon thinking so, I suddenly figure out his true identity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5217"><span>There are four more Demon Lords. With one of them being the missing <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we only have Clayman and MIlim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5218"><span>Then it is Leon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5219"><span>I remember Leon has blonde hair——so called 「Platinum Demon」, the beautiful blonde Demon Lord…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5220"><span>「——So, are you Leon? Why would you want to have a word with me?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5221"><span>「Yes, I am Leon. I didn’t come to you for anything in particular. It is just that I feel a sense of nostalgia seeing your face.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5222"><span>He is indeed Leon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5223"><span>What a beautiful man, it may mislead people easily to think that he’s a beautiful woman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5224"><span>If it’s me from the past, I would definitely shout in heart 「WHAT THE HELL! (IT’S A TRAP!)</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;The actual line here is somewhere along the line of “go explode”.

In other words, Leon——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5229"><span>「Leon, Shizue-san has already passed away.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5230"><span>He didn’t come to me for anything in particular, simply being reminiscent of Shizue-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5231"><span>「I know. Of course she would die. Simply because she refused to accept Ifrit and didn’t want to become a Majin.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5232"><span>Leon says it lighted-heartedly as if it was only natural.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5233"><span>「She once asked me to punch you in the face. Please allow me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5234"><span>The line slips out of my mouth without my thinking. I wasn’t trying to look for trouble but Leon’s attitude is irritating.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5235"><span>I say it clear and straight. But, Leon is not moved by it at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5236"><span>「I refuse. I’ve given Shizue a chance to choose for her own life. She didn’t want to become a Majin and wanted to live as a human. I even gifted her Ifrit when we parted, so there’s no reason for you to punch me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5237"><span>That’s surprising.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5238"><span>And I would have thought he’d get mad and call me rude. Yet he responds to me calmly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5239"><span>Besides from that——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5240"><span>「——However, I’m also a little bit interested in you. If you want to complain to me, my treat. Or you can refuse if you think it’s a trap. But it doesn’t matter either way.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5241"><span>He says so himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5242"><span>It feels as though he’s saying “Don’t come if you are scared”, so I could only accept.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5243"><span>「Alright, I’ll accept. Remember to send an invitation.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5244"><span>I go silent after my response.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5245"><span>Leon nods his head slightly but with an annoyed twitch at how troublesome he thinks it would be.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5246"><span>「Right, I’ll do just that. But first, you have to return in one piece.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5247"><span>He wraps up coldly and takes the seat on my left.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5248"><span>He’s not going to talk to me anymore.That’s probably the end of that conversation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5249"><span>It would be enough progress on the matter for now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5250"><span>I’ve relayed Shizue-san’s words and I now know one more thing: Leon is not trying to make me an enemy. If he has considered me an enemy, why would he agree to send an invitation?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5251"><span>The problem lies on what happens after that. Anyhow, I need to focus on dealing the enemy that is Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5252"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5253"><span>It’s been an hour since the time I first entered the meeting.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5254"><span>Time passed on just like that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5255"><span>The order of leading the Demon Lords into the meeting room seems to be based on their experience. I was a guest so I happened to have the privilege to travel with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5256"><span>However, there’s also someone like Leon who came in by his own strength, that doesn't seem to be a written rule.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5257"><span>Now all there is left are Clayman and Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5258"><span>Just when the Banquet was about to start, a thought flashed through my mind——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5259"><span>「Rimuru-sama, is it convenient for me to borrow some time of yours to report our progress? 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5260"><span>It’s Benimaru, he’s communicating through 「Telepathy Net」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5261"><span>The meeting seems to be in a different dimension, so how did 「Telepathy Net」 come through——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5262"><span>《Answer. You’ve established connection with </span><span>monster</span><span>s under your rule with 「Soul Corridor」. You can communicate through it.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5263"><span>——So that’s how it worked.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5264"><span>It seems that during my blessing, 「Soul Corridor」 was connected as well. It feels weaker than the one I use to contact Veldora, but it seems to work fine with communication.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5265"><span>I begin to listen to Benimaru’s report.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5266"><span>It’s been less than an hour since the war started, yet it’s already over. It sounds like it has been going exactly as planned.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5267"><span>Our army has many injured but zero casualties. As for Clayman’s army, there is more than a thousand deaths. There are over three thousand injured as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5268"><span>It’s a surprisingly low death toll, but in this world, as long as one is alive, there is a chance of restoring them to their original state. So it’s reasonable many weren’t killed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5269"><span>In any case, we achieved complete victory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5270"><span>And we caught prisoners, hooray!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5271"><span>The commanding officer of the enemies seems to have turned into Charybdis somehow, but was incinerated by Benimaru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5272"><span>I am a bit out of loop with what he’s saying.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5273"><span>Since I can’t understand, I’ll just skip it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5274"><span>Although it is best that I skip it, but….. How did he kill Charybdis when it has 「Magic Interference」?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5275"><span>《Answer. His unique skill 「Great General」 can compile multiple techniques and skills to perfectly control 「Black Flame Prison」.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5276"><span>So that’s the case.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5277"><span>In short, his manipulation technique was superior than 「Magic Interference」 and was able to directly input massive amounts of heat. It may sound easy but it requires quite the level of skill.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5278"><span>Benimaru seems to have grown stronger than I’ve anticipated. Very impressive!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5279"><span>What we didn’t anticipate however, was the Worshipers of Dragon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5280"><span>They are worthy as Milim’s believers and seems to be an absurdly powerful battle group.

I told you that I have evidence.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5479"><span>I interrupt Clayman and take out a couple of crystal balls from my pocket.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5480"><span>The crystal ball is then transferred to the center of the round table and activates its magical effect one by one.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5481"><span>Every crystal ball carries a video recording.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5482"><span>There is footage of the fights between my subordinates and Orc Lord through Gelmud’s point of view.

If it’s true that Veldora has been revived, why would he bother to trouble himself by doing all this?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5521"><span>「T-that’s because…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5522"><span>The question came from an unexpected place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5523"><span>Dagruel speaks up and questions Clayman with much majesty.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5524"><span>Clayman is troubled for a while and decides to go all out with his response.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5525"><span>「Alright, then allow me to explain.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5526"><span>Then Clayman begins to explain, exaggerating and overstating it once more, using body language to convey it</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5527"><span>If one is to collect human souls, one will awake to become a True Demon Lord——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5528"><span>He seems to have hidden this matter in hope of preventing the other Demon Lords to get the benefits of it first. Now that Dagruel has asked, he has to open up and state things clearly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5529"><span>「——This reckless, lowly slime was lucky enough to evolve to the Demon Lord Breed. Then he went over the line to have human society investigate the truth. After which he presumptuously caused a war between human and </span><span>monster</span><span>. And orchestrated a massacre using Veldora who has been sealed and allowed it to rampage out in the world. Our reputation as Demon Lord will plummet as a result. That’s why I think we must eliminate him, what do you all think?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5530"><span>With his emphasised body language, Clayman attempts to persuade the other Demon Lords of his case. .</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5531"><span>But——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5532"><span>「So what, you would need evidence for that. Can you even give us that? You’re daydreaming if you think that would work.

Don’t you look down on me, you slime, bluffing just because you have the power of the evil dragon! Likes of you could never become a Demon Lord.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5536"><span>「It’s irrelevant whether or not I am a slime. Besides Veldora is my friend. But I have not come here to listen to your nonsense. You should just give up and &nbsp;just admit that those clowns followed </span><span>your </span><span>instructions in reviving the Charybdis. The Majin called Phobio in those footages can testify that he’s been encouraged by that clown “Footman”! Moreover, your subordinate just caused a havoc after transforming into Charybdis. This is all clear evidence. Call me a bluff if you want, but you can go to hell, thinking that.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5537"><span>I kick off the chair next to me to get up and contend against Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5538"><span>I put forward my hand casually put it where my hand is about to touch at the round table. The gigantic round table disappears instantly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5539"><span>There is nothing surprising about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5540"><span>It’s simply consumed by my 「Gluttonous King Beezlebuth」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5541"><span>Now I’ve cleared out a large space.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5542"><span>The kicked chair &nbsp;flys on behind Clayman and collides against the wall loudly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5543"><span>The Demon Lords don’t seem to be moved by it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5544"><span>The only one scared is Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5545"><span>「Everyone, how can you tolerate such violent behaviour from this guy!? He’s even ignoring our authority. We should punish him together!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5546"><span>Together he says.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5547"><span>As expected, this guy is real scum.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5548"><span>I stand up entirely and move towards the center of the empty round space surrounded by chairs.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5549"><span>「Right, I’ve mentioned before, I don’t care whether I become Demon Lord or not. I just want to create a country satisfactory for myself. I need human help in that aspect, that’s why I’ve decided to protect the humans. If anyone dares to intrude, whether they be humans, Demon Lords or the Saints Church, they are all my enemies. For instance, you, Clayman.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5550"><span>I take a even more avid approach compared to Clayman and announce my ideal in front of the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5551"><span>「WHAT——!!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5552"><span>「As for violent behaviour, you said, did you plan to attend the Walpurgis Banquet while trying to mind control others?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5553"><span>I fix my eyes on Clayman and ask.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5554"><span>He must think I didn’t notice. He was quite arrogant, thinking he could cast a psychic attack on me halfway through his speech.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5555"><span>He probably wanted to control me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5556"><span>However, it won’t work.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5557"><span>Simply because 「<span data-term="Wisdom King Raphael" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」 is always protecting me. Attacks like that will always be nullified instantly</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5558"><span>But with that being said, I now have a justified approach.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5559"><span>I could argue that, in a sense, Clayman was the one who striked first.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5560"><span>If any other Demon Lords dare to confront me on this, I’ll see what to do with them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5561"><span>I make up my mind to resort to violence.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5562"><span>But after I said so with much resolve.

You don’t see me eye to eye, so shouldn’t it be a problem between us?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5568"><span>「That’s right, Clayman. You are a Demon Lord as well. Then go and defeat this Majin by yourself. And you——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5569"><span>Guy tells Clayman to shut up and looks towards me while saying:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5570"><span>「Do you want to be a Demon Lord?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5571"><span>「Yes. Since I’ve already taken the position as the leader of the Jura Great Forest Alliance. The humans have seen me as a Demon Lord for a long time now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5572"><span>They won’t care about the story, all they will care about is that I’ve collaborated with the evil dragon in taking over the forest.

If you can beat Clayman here and now, we’ll approve your becoming a Demon Lord.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5574"><span>Guy announces to me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5575"><span>If I can defeat Clayman, we can settle everything nicely.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5576"><span>That’s just what I want.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5577"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5578"><span>Clayman quickly regains his composure and begins to laugh.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5579"><span>「Gogogo, my goodness. I plotted all this so I won’t get my hands dirty, yet things got even more complicated than I expected. How unwise I was.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5580"><span>Clayman says so while laughing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5581"><span>Is he accepting the reality?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5582"><span>Clayman he laughs at me coldly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5583"><span>Then——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5584"><span>「It’s time for you to shine, Milim.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5585"><span>He says so calmly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5586"><span>The atmosphere immediately becomes much, much more tense; even the Demon Lords become nervous along with it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5587"><span>Although some of them retain their same, casual expression and posture.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5588"><span>My eyes also fall on Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5589"><span>He has kept shown his hand——Milim is under his control.

Guy, do you have an objection?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5595"><span>「Not at all, Clayman. If Milim is willingly helping you, then I won’t interfere.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5596"><span>This is no good.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5597"><span>Clayman alone is fine, but Milim is very strong.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5598"><span>Guy agrees without thinking, it would seem that I have to confront Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5599"><span>If my opponent is Milim, I won’t be able to beat her with my current power level.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5600"><span>Besides I want to find a way to save her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5601"><span>No, I must save her!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5602"><span>Right now, Milim, who seems to be frozen, seems to be holding her fist tight, looking no difference from a doll and raises her hands to do a victory pose…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5603"><span>——No, that was just an instant, maybe I’ve been mistaken.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5604"><span>Seriously, what a poor thing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5605"><span>I’m gonna save you soon, Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5606"><span>I swear to myself in heart.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5607"><span>「Right then.

It would be bullying for me to fight you myself.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5610"><span>Clayman’s expression seems frozen by my words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5611"><span>He’s probably mad as he begins to dissipate black Youki.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5612"><span>As expected from a Demon Lord. There is plenty of pressure in the air.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5613"><span>But, it feels pretty average.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5614"><span>If that’s the case, Clayman will probably show some openings because of his anger and anxiety.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5615"><span>Shion is going to fight in my place, she’s good at exploiting those traits.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5616"><span>I signal with my eyes towards Shion and she takes action immediately.

Clayman has been provoked by my words, now take your chance!——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5623"><span>I sent out such signal to her, but I didn’t tell her to beat the enemy to a pulp in an instant.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5624"><span>Then what’s the point of me exposing enemies’ openings……?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5625"><span>*Sigh*, but what can you do when the man is already beaten.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5626"><span>Clayman was launched flying due to the impact of the hits and fell in front of me.

He is surprisingly durable.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5629"><span>The thick black Youki that wrapped around him suddenly thickens and heals all of his wounds instantly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5630"><span>That’s much stronger regenerative ability compared to Orc Lord. But he is a Demon Lord, so abilities such as this should be normal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5631"><span>Clayman seems to be targeting Shion as enemy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5632"><span>Alright, things are going according to plan.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5633"><span>「As you wish, I’ll kill you all.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5634"><span>By Clayman’s order, the fox that ran to his feet begins to grow bigger.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5635"><span>《Warning.

I’m on Rimuru’s side and want to let my Beretta join the fight!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5679"><span>Ramiris begins to demand Guy not knowing her place, but Guy’s response is very cold.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5680"><span>「No.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5681"><span>He is not buying it at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5682"><span>「Why?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5683"><span>「Huh? This is a battle between Demon Lords. How could you let a mere servant join the fight. Besides, isn’t it a fight between that slime and Clayman? Why is that &nbsp;any of your business?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5684"><span>「Don’t be so mean! Milim has also joined the battle.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5685"><span>「Yeah, but that is fine.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5686"><span>「What is that supposed to mean? Why won’t you allow me then?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5687"><span>Annoying as hell——Guy thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5688"><span>Ramiris was a always an annoying fairy, and once she decides to be noisy she just won’t stop.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5689"><span>To this day Ramiris has never brought servants to the meeting. That’s why Guy thought there must be some hidden motives why Ramiris has brought servants this time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5690"><span>MIlim also seems to be planning something, it will only makes things more chaotic if Ramiris decides to join the battle. In order to prevent this from happening, Guy has intentionally separated the battle zone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5691"><span>「Aren’t you annoying, Milim is probably planning something on her own.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5692"><span>「You say it as if I’ve not come up with any genius plan!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5693"><span>「Is it not that the case? Moreover——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5694"><span>As he says so, Guy looks towards one of Ramiris’ servants, Beretta.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5695"><span>「——Who’s your servant loyal to? The other one’s protecting you with all her heart, but this one really isn’t. He’s loyal to you on the surface, but is he completely loyal to you? Are you really fine with dealing with this type of unknown retainer?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5696"><span>Guy can tell.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5697"><span>Beretta is loyal to someone else besides Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5698"><span>Ramiris is an important friend of Guy’s. That’s why he can’t tolerate that her servant isn’t completely loyal to his master.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5699"><span>「You are indeed right, I am comparing my master to someone else.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5700"><span>Beretta is not troubled hearing Guy’s words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5701"><span>His summoner is Rimuru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5702"><span>And his creator is Rimuru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5703"><span>Yet he also has another master, which is Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5704"><span>This Demon Lord is very optimistic, reckless everywhere she goes, curious like an infant and extremely timid. Beretta has grown a liking towards her and her personality.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5705"><span>That’s why he doesn’t feel worn out by his job of being toyed around by her all day.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5706"><span>Rimuru wants him to protect Ramiris. He is also glad that he himself is able to serve Ramiris. So he doesn’t feel conflicted.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5707"><span>But there is one point.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5708"><span>Beretta still wishes to repay Rimuru’s kindness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5709"><span>It is Rimuru who introduced him to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5710"><span>He was once of the Demon race. Rimuru was able to give him a new life and new duty——He wants to repay such kindness.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5711"><span>Apart from that——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5712"><span>「Similar to my wish, Ramiris-sama also wants to save that Lord——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5713"><span>Beretta asserts without restraint towards Guy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5714"><span>「Oh? You are not afraid of me and dare to talk straight to me. Interesting. Ramiris, is this guy speaking the truth?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5715"><span>Guy asks, but he realises it’s unnecessary as soon as he sees her expression.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5716"><span>「Hmm! Of course it’s true! That’s why Beretta, go in my place and save Rimuru!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5717"><span>「Ehh——So this guy will carry out your wish. You’ve recruited quite the servant, Ramiris. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5718"><span>「No, I didn’t recruit him, I am his companion. Beretta, Treyni and Rimuru, too! And many, many, many more!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5719"><span>Ramiris says so with a joyful smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5720"><span>「Never mind, I’ll allow this.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5721"><span>Guy doesn’t know what Ramiris is trying to get out of this, but as long as she’s happy it’s fine. He does not object.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5722"><span>He puts forward his hand looking impatiently and opens a hole in the barrier.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5723"><span>「——Many thanks, Primordial Red (Rouge).」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5724"><span>「Hmm. Spare me the title. I’ll allow you to call me Guy. But from now on, you can only recognize Ramiris as your master, do you understand?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5725"><span>Allowing him to call his name——To Guy, this means he has recognized Beretta’s strength.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5726"><span>And right now, Guy wants Beretta to choose a master. If he doesn’t, Guy plans to end him right there.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5727"><span>But Beretta agrees without hesitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5728"><span>「Then, Guy. I shall pledge my loyalty towards Ramiris. For that reason, please allow me help Rimuru-sama out this once.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5729"><span>Guy is a bit surprised.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5730"><span>To the Demon race, their master must be strong enough. Yet Beretta doesn’t seem to be interested in strength.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5731"><span>What an odd ideal. In other words, he is an outcast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5732"><span>「Is that all?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5733"><span>「Yes. Rimuru-sama has servants stronger than me to serve him.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5734"><span>So that’s the case, Guy thinks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5735"><span>But he also begins to doubt. Beretta has openly admitted that someone is stronger than him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5736"><span>「Besides, I really enjoy research. Everyday spent with Ramiris-sama researching is like a dream——Oh, apologies. Rimuru-sama also wishes for me to serve Ramiris-sama. There is no need for you to worry.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5737"><span>Hearing Beretta, Guy suddenly recalls a certain Demon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5738"><span>To pursue things that one desires and those only, that is the alternative definition for outcasts.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5739"><span>From his type alone, it won’t be anything strange to have given birth to a Demon with the personality similar to Beretta——But everyone knows that particular Demon do not create vessels often.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5740"><span>No, very few people know about him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5741"><span>「I have a question. Which branch (faction) are you from——?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5742"><span>Beretta turns his face up behind his mask, and a smile becomes visible.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5743"><span>「——I am just a humble nobody, a Greater Demon. But, Demons from the same branch as mine are very rare.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5744"><span>Rare system——Then it can be confirmed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5745"><span>Now Beretta’s hair color has faded to silver, but its original color was probably…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5746"><span>「I see. That’s why you are not afraid of me. Your kind of Demon always do what your heart desires and put your personal feelings first. Does that mean you admit someone is stronger than you?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5747"><span>Guy glances towards the battling Shion and Ranga and turns back to look at Beretta.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5748"><span>Shion and Ranga are indeed strong. But, Beretta is definitely not weaker.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5749"><span>「I feel much honor receiving your praise, but my abilities are nothing to be mentioned. With that Lord serving Rimuru-sama, I won’t have another chance to show my skills.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5750"><span>「Hmm, I see. I understand how you feel. Go on.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5751"><span>The hole on the barrier is large enough for one person to pass.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5752"><span>「Then excuse me for my leaving.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5753"><span>Beretta bows elegantly before proceeding without hesitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5754"><span>Guy smiles as he sees him off.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5755"><span>He has sensed what’s weird.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5756"><span>He knows the one Beretta is talking about.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5757"><span>——Is that so? You are on the move too, Primordial Black (Noir)!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5758"><span>His old friend that parted way with him eons ago.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5759"><span>This newcomer has even recruited character like that. This slime battling Milim has suddenly become very intriguing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5760"><span>The outcast serves the outcast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5761"><span>His name seems to be Rimuru. I’ll remember it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5762"><span>With such thoughts, Guy observes the fight with delight. The result of which seems very obvious to him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5763"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5764"><span>This is bad.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5765"><span>If you ask me which part of this is bad, it would be Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5766"><span>Combating her is really strenuous, to the point that I’ve even had to let go of my anger towards Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5767"><span>She hasn’t applied any combat style that Phobio hasn’t seen yet (referring to vol 3 event), so she probably hasn’t gone all out yet…… But she is so overpowered to the point of unreasonable.

One of which has been summoned by Gobuta so now he can’t call for more reinforcements.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5775"><span>But that should be sufficient.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5776"><span>Nine-Head Beast has incredibly high amount of magicule storage, but it seems to be lacking in combat experience.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5777"><span>Ranga still have the upper hand when fighting it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5778"><span>With that being said, the two </span><span>monster</span><span>s summoned by Nine-Head Beast are surprisingly difficult to deal with.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5779"><span>They are White Ape and Moon Rabbit</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Both animals are commonly seen in myths and classic literature in Japanese and Chinese cultures.." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;according to results of my 「Analysis」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5780"><span>The two are capable of conducting collaborated counter-attack with plenty high intelligence. It’s very challenging to deal with. The Moon Rabbit is able to manipulate gravity to pressure the battle zone while the White Ape is flying all over the place while hitting down hard. The Nine-Head Beast on the other hand is responsible for delivering the fatal blow to enemies.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5781"><span>This combat strategy is almost invincible.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5782"><span>But Ranga has seen through their tactic and disrupted the cooperative approach employed by the enemies.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5783"><span>He could have used a more powerful attack to achieve victory, but he’s afraid to affect Shion in that way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5784"><span>He is with the upper hand indeed, but he is able to deliver the final blow.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5785"><span>As for Shion——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5786"><span>She is holding up with brute force.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5787"><span>The black-cape is a delicate magic doll. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_5788"><span>And honestly, it looks stronger than Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5789"><span>「Hehehehahahaha, how do you like my finest work Piorra? Isn’t it dazzling?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5790"><span>Clayman is extremely confident, but not without his reason.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5791"><span>The doll is undoubtedly powerful.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5792"><span>However, if you ask me whether it looks dazzling (pretty) or not, the answer it’s no.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5793"><span>Because it is equipped with weapons all over its body.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5794"><span>Every item is a special grade weapon as well as its armor. Yet with too many of them stuck onto it, there isn’t any sense of aesthetic at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5795"><span>Fire, lightning, ice, heavy weight, resonance, as well as other attacks seem to be constantly poured out by it without an end.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5796"><span>But Shion doesn’t seem to mind these attacks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_5797"><span>Any enemy she encounters would have to deal with the troubling skill of 「Super Regeneration」.

I turn around to look at the last person, Shion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6000"><span>Right there, the result is about to be revealed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6001"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6002"><span>Clayman is breathing heavily as he stares at Shion hatefully.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6003"><span>It would seem he has learnt how strong Shion is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6004"><span>It would be an understatement to say Clayman seems to have been been getting draws from fighting Shion. That’s because Shion has the incredible trump card of 「Super Regeneration」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6005"><span>Their powers are on par yet Shion has the upper hand in terms of endurance. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6006"><span>The exchanges between the two seem to be equally matched, but Clayman already seemed tired as I was battling Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6007"><span>Shion would probably win even without my help.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6008"><span>Right now Clayman must be anxious seeing Shion has the advantage.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6009"><span>「Is that all you got? Aren’t you too weak to call yourself a Demon Lord?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6010"><span>Shion sure is ruthless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6011"><span>She’s totalling despising Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6012"><span>「B-bastard, unforgivable! Go, Dancing Mannequin!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6013"><span>As he finishes, Clayman releases five mannequins. They immediately turn into Majins and throw themselves towards Shion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6014"><span>Every one of them is a Greater Majin.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6015"><span>Clayman has infused the souls of Majins he has collected with the mannequins in preparation of their immediate manipulation. They are his hidden combat forces.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6016"><span>It’s no time for him to reserve his forces, so he pulls out all his aces in a go.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6017"><span>These forces are more than enough to defeat normal Majin.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6018"><span>However——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6019"><span>Shion pulls out her beloved odachi and slashes the five Majins in one hit.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6020"><span>「How boring. You’ve really got nothing interesting.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6021"><span>She says so towards Clayman looking chilled as ever.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6022"><span>She sustained the battle without a scratch.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6023"><span>Shion actually has more style of a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6024"><span>On the contrary, Clayman begins to shiver and shouts with the expression of having been greatly shamed:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6025"><span>「Q-quit joking around, you bastard! It’s too early for you to get cocky! My Dancing Mannequins will restore themselves soon and attack you. Now we are doing things seriously!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6026"><span>He is not being sour about losing, but there is really that kind of effect in play.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6027"><span>Shion waits for it without a care, yet the Mannequins have no sign of getting up.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6028"><span>There is of course a reason for it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6029"><span>「H-how can this…… Why aren’t they revived?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6030"><span>Clayman mumbles to himself with anxiety in his eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6031"><span>His proud combat force has not gotten back to their feet, causing him to be confused.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6032"><span>Since that’s the case, I shall explain things for him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6033"><span>「Uhh——how troublesome, but I’ll tell you. Shion’s odachi can consume souls. Did you forget to apply defensive spells for the physical and spiritual resistance of your mannequins? If you are that crude in craftsmanship, of course they would get trashed in one slash.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6034"><span>There’s no point in hiding at this point.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6035"><span>I was planning to eat Clayman anyway, so I’ll tell what he wants to know.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6036"><span>「T-this knife possesses spiritual attack!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6037"><span>「That’s nothing rare, even the humans are using them.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6038"><span>「I-impossible! That’s a rare power even among special-grade equipments!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6039"><span>「Yeah——right. They are knives made by my people anyway.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6040"><span>I’ve improved Shion’s odachi greatly on basis of Hinata’s sword. Now it can attack spiritual body.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6041"><span>It isn’t really consuming souls, but the knife is able to cause damage to spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6042"><span>Depending on the power applied in her attack, those without resistive power would instantly die, nor does it have the limitation of seven hits. That’s why there is no way to confirm whether the enemies are killed or not, but it won’t be much of an issue considering Shion doesn’t know how to hold back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6043"><span>Besides, it is a combined heavy attack causing both physical and spiritual damages, so you won’t even need seven hits to ensure the kill.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6044"><span>「Oh, is that so? Then it would be 『Hercules’ Edge · Ex』 </span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Ex here is “改”, in Japanese it means revised. Commonly seen in rpgs" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6045"><span>You didn’t know…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6046"><span>Didn’t I clarified when briefing with you? Never mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6047"><span>Shion really is too lazy to memorize such difficult mechanisms, so it was the right call to have improved its function.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6048"><span>「Go, gogogo, is that so? You are using the power of that knife to fight me. Then I should claim that annoying knife as well into my collection! Consume it, Superb Demon Lord Domination!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6049"><span>Clayman seems to have misunderstood something.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6050"><span>Creepy beams of black light begin to shoot out of Clayman’s hands and they wrap around Shion’s body from bottom to top.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6051"><span>Shion is doing nothing in response.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6052"><span>Ehh, you could have dodged that and then finish him off……. Fine then, it doesn’t seem necessary.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6053"><span>Clayman might have thought that Shion was too slow to react. He looks rather pleased at this sight.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6054"><span>「Gogogogogo. You should be happy, this is the ultimate curse spell that can even control Demon Lords! It is quite the waste to use it against Majin like you, but it doesn’t matter. I’ll have to reorganize the Five Fingers anyway. Come be my subordinate and be of use to me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6055"><span>He is completely mistaken judging by his words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6056"><span>How pathetic, Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6057"><span>Shion is not rendered unable to move, it’s simply that she doesn’t want to move.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6058"><span>Clayman has boasted this skill to the roof yet it has had no effect. But perhaps you guys (readers) don’t know why that’s the case either.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6059"><span>Shion has obtained the skill 「Perfect Memory」 that can store her memory in her astral body——In simpler terms, it is a special skill that can save memory even when the brain is damaged.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6060"><span>As long as one retains his conscious soul and memory, he can be revived even when his body is completely damaged. She has become a special species. It won’t be too much to call her a semi-spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6061"><span>In other words, she can think with her soul.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6062"><span>That means she has complete immunity against all mind control effects.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6063"><span>Opponents against Shion have can’t do anything with domination spells.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6064"><span>「Oi, what are you trying to do with this? I don’t even feel a thing, do I have to wait a little longer?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6065"><span>Shion asks impatiently as she has been wrapped around like a cacoon by the black silk. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6066"><span>I’ve had this thought long ago……. You should really change your pro-wrestler mindset.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6067"><span>Why would you intentionally fall into enemies’ trap in real battles…….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6068"><span>Whether it is Shion, or <span data-term="Suphia" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or even Milim, I can’t understand this mindset of a battle frenzy. Stop it, get some help.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6069"><span>「<span data-term="Wisdom King Raphael" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」 explains that Shion is not affected by the skill, so it is unnecessary to be cautious against Clayman’s secret technique.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6070"><span>「H-how could this be…….. Why is my Superb Demon Lord Denomination not working? Impossible, there is no such thing! That is the ultimate curse spell that can control even Demon lords!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6071"><span>It is the spell that controlled the Nine-Head Beast. Indeed, it seems to be able to easily dominate Calamity-level beings, but shouldn’t it be useless against Disaster-level Demon Lords?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6072"><span>This Clayman is too overconfident with his power.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6073"><span>Shion then, probably bored of waiting, blows away the black cocoon in an instant with her Youki.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6074"><span>「How very boring. You don’t deserve to be a Demon Lord when relying on such petit trickery.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6075"><span>Shion says so with much disdain in her tone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6076"><span>Seeing this, Clayman falls into panic. He freezes on the spot.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6077"><span>——No, that’s not true.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6078"><span>Shion’s words seem to have touch Clayman’s nerve.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6079"><span>「Gogogo, Gohahahaha——! How dare you say I don’t deserve to be Demon Lord? Unforgivable, trash! I’ll make you regret this, regret having forced me to use my real power.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6080"><span>He begins to shake his shoulder and laughs out without any care. His laughter sounds desolate.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6081"><span>He then begins to take off all his classy clothes, exposing his upper body. Clayman has secretly carried many gadgets and items, but he doesn’t seem interested in using them and scattered them all over the place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6082"><span>Just as I thought that things are about to end, it turns out Clayman has kept a hand (four actually) up his sleeve.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6083"><span>After exposing his upper body, two pairs of hands grow out of his back. Those hands look slim and long and are wrapped in black exoskeletons.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6084"><span>That’s who he truly is——It is a completely different figure from his previous disguise, one that reeks an aura of insanity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6085"><span>「Yes, of course. Yes, Demon Lord. I am Demon Lord. That’s why I care about how I fight. I send my enemies to their graves with elegance and grace. But that’s enough. Enough. This feeling, I’ve forgotten for too long……. I’ll crash you with my hands!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6086"><span>He roars with rage and reveals his true nature.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6087"><span>Clayman is holding something, something precious looking.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6088"><span>It is a mask, a clown mask with the carving of a smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6089"><span>He puts it on without hesitation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6090"><span>「Oh? Now you seem a bit more intrigued. You are beginning to impress me. I am Demon Lord Rimuru-sama’s personal secretary Shion. Allow me to be your opponent!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6091"><span>Shion looks delighted and announces her name to Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6092"><span>Clayman also——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6093"><span>「Demon Lord——No, I am 『The Laughing Clown (Crazy Pierrot)』</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;The original title “喜狂の道化” translate more to “Ecstatic Clown”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;Clayman. I’ll kill you, Majin Shion!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6094"><span>He responds by announcing his title</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6095"><span>That’s how they begin their fight at the same time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6096"><span>*</span><span>**</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6097"><span>Clayman with his true self revealed is very strong.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6098"><span>As expected from a Demon Lord, he is approaching Shion with a strong mana. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6099"><span>His natural pair of hands are controlling those ominous black silk beams.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6100"><span>The upper pair of hands on his back hold an axe and a mace while the lower half holds a sword and a shield.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6101"><span>He is trying to give Shion a hard time with manipulation of both magical and physical attacks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6102"><span>However, Shion is stronger.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6103"><span>She waves her odachi named 「Hercules’ Edge · Ex」 to deflect Clayman’s sword and smash through his shield.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6104"><span>Her straight swing from up to down also destroyed the defending axe and mace.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6105"><span>All of these wild strength originates from Shion’s unique skill</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;The original term “固有技” should translate to unique skill, though wiki says it’s a battle skill" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;「Demonification」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6106"><span>As for her almost cheating effect of weapon destruction, it is probably due to「Decisive Result」 and 「Optimal Action」 from (her skill) 「Chef」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6107"><span>In other words, Clayman is no match against Shion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6108"><span>Even with his true strength, Clayman is still beaten to a pulp by Shion.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6109"><span>The two pairs of iron wrists crossed behind his back are defending against Shion’s fists, yet those four hands have been broken. Shion was also able to score a punch right on Clayman’s stomach.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6110"><span>「WOOOOOOOHHHHHHH…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6111"><span>Clayman seems to be in great pain as he begins to foam from his mouth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6112"><span>The result is set.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6113"><span>I may sound like I’m favouring my subordinate, but Shion has become super strong. She came back from death and obtained far greater strength than before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6114"><span>「GAPUUUUUUUUUU——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6115"><span>Shion gives Clayman another kick. He begins to spin on the ground with a depressed expression.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6116"><span>His mask is broken to reveal his bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6117"><span>「.......Im…..Impo…...ssible…...I-I don’t believe. I…...me…….Demon Lord Clayman is….!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6118"><span>He finally realizes the difference in strength with his opponent and couldn’t accept such reality. Clayman seems out of his mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6119"><span>「Rimuru-sama, can I take his life?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6120"><span>Shion asks me now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6121"><span>About that, though I still have some questions to ask, but I’ve guessed about most of his answers. The only thing left is the identity of the man behind the scene, would he answer honestly though?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6122"><span>「D-damnit! Milim, what the hell is Milim doing? That type of trash, go ahead and defeat——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6123"><span>Clayman seems to know his death is imminent and shout in panic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6124"><span>However, the Milim in his words has been suppressed by Veldora. Suspecting at this point, Clayman looks at Veldora with eyes of witnessing unbelieving scenery…….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6125"><span>「W-who are you……..? W-What is this? What is with the incredible power——!!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6126"><span>It seems that he has discovered that Veldora is no ordinary Majin.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6127"><span>「Although he may look human, he is actually Veldora. Didn’t I just say we are friends?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6128"><span>Clayman is speechless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6129"><span>He seems to be denying, but upon seeing how the opponent was able to put up a fight against Milim, he is forced to accept reality.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6130"><span>Veldora has been fighting Milim until now with elegant fighting styles. In between there seem to be shouts of familiar technique names. Milim seems to be reacting quite surprisingly to them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6131"><span>It’s making me question——whether she is really being manipulated?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6132"><span>《...............》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6133"><span>I have some doubts regarding Milim’s reaction, but never mind, I’ll leave her alone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6134"><span>Veldora seems to be having fun fighting in human form for the first time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6135"><span>It is right then, Clayman gave up seeking help from Milim. In the midst of Chaos, he changes his plan to flee to the edge of the battlezone and begins to shout to the outside.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6136"><span>「F-Frey! Frey, what are you doing? We are on the same boat here, come and help me!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6137"><span>Clayman begs for help with he can yet Frey’s reaction is extremely cold.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6138"><span>「Ara, pardon me now, Clayman. I can’t enter this 『Barrier』 without Guy’s permission. What a shame.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6139"><span>Just like that, she gives such fake response.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6140"><span>Clayman smacks his lip unpleasantly and turns his head towards Milim again.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6141"><span>His eyes twitch frequently as the last bit of sanity within him ceases to exist——he has gone completely mad. It would seem Clayman has come up with some bad idea again. With a crazy smile on his face, his eyes fall on Milim once more.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6142"><span>「Goha-GOHAHAHAHA! Milim, oh Milim! Hear my command and activate 『Frenzy Berserk』 ! Go and kill all of these people!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6143"><span>He spills out such frantic words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6144"><span>Clayman is no longer caring about his image, he only wishes to live.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6145"><span>Oh shit, now we are done.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6146"><span>I can’t just sit around and watch anymore. I need to join the battle.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6147"><span>Yet it is then I heard some unbelievable words coming into my ears.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6148"><span>「Why would I do that? Rimuru and them are all my friends!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6149"><span>I turn back in shock and see Milim smirking and chilling there.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6150"><span>「Milim! Wait, aren’t you being controlled……?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6151"><span>「WHA——HAHAHA! You seem to have been fooled all this time, Rimuru! How could I be controlled by Clayman?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6152"><span>N-NANI?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6153"><span>《...............》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6154"><span>For some reason, 「<span data-term="Wisdom King Raphael" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>」 started to sound quite angry from just now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6155"><span>But I’ll ignore it for now, Milim is the focus here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6156"><span>「So, are you not controlled by Clayman?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6157"><span>Eh——What in the world is going on? I unconsciously tried to double check. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6158"><span>But, Milim only gives me a proud smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6159"><span>I am not the only person who’s confused.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6160"><span>One of the Demon Lord also said in surprise: 「Eh?

But, Frey said…… Oh, so Frey was in it too. Even you betrayed me——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6196"><span>Now that he has cleared up the story, Clayman stares his eyes at Frey like a madman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6197"><span>But, Frey doesn’t seem to care one bit.</span></p><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image2.png" title="" height="840" width="610" class="line" id="line_6198"><p class="line" id="line_6199"><span>Considering the situation, rather to say she’s betrayed Clayman, it’s more like she…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6200"><span>「Ara?

Now there won’t be any Demon Lord trying to defend him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6222"><span>The 「Barrier」 separating the battlezone has been deactivated. Frey walks towards us and then turns straight towards Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6223"><span>「I trusted that you won’t be manipulated, but I was still quite nervous, MIlim. But, you have followed through our “promise”, thank you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6224"><span>「WHAHAHA! Of course I will since we are friends. Right, Frey, have you kept good care of that thing and brought it here?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6225"><span>「I did, are you referring to this? Speaking of which, you are even immune towards the dominating orb, you are truly strong….. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6226"><span>The two continued to exchange as Frey takes out something from her pocket to hand to Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6227"><span>It’s the Dragon Knuckle I gifted her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6228"><span>Milim seems delighted and takes the thing as she couldn’t wait to put them on.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6229"><span>And a smile blooms on her face.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6230"><span>Milim and Frey’s interactions have all been observed by the Demon Lords. After seeing all these, they’ve finally been brought updated to the situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6231"><span>「So that was all an act.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6232"><span>「I-I saw through it from the start!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6233"><span>「That’s how I guessed things should be.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6234"><span>「So that’s how it was…..」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6235"><span>As such, I overheard many conversations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6236"><span>I shouldn’t be the only one who was fooled by Milim, yet in the end everyone acts as if they’ve known long ago.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6237"><span>Just then, I heard a moan in pain near my foot.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6238"><span>「——F-from when? How long have you deceived me……?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6239"><span>It’s Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6240"><span>It would seem he’s still struggling to grasp his last breath. He couldn’t believe this. It was unacceptable to him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6241"><span>Milim reveals the cruel truth to Clayman on the ground.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6242"><span>「Hmm, I worked really hard! I made a “promise” with Frey to pretend being tricked. And I put on the wristband to mislead you into thinking you’ve controlled me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6243"><span>「.....Q-quit joking around….. That was the Dominating Orb infused with all of my mana…..highest level…...most powerful domination curse spell…..! And how could you——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6244"><span>「Hmm! I could resist most of those magics. I deactivated most of my barriers and force myself with my own will to give up resisting….. I know you are cautious enough to not believe the curse spell has worked until you see it with you eyes. I was able to make it through in that way!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6245"><span>「W-What did you….say? You….you let others intentionally cast a curse on you. And even with my highest level magic item…… my ultimate technique that can even dominate Demon Lords…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6246"><span>「Is that so? But, it would be impossible to dominate me!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6247"><span>MIlim raises her chest and brags looking all proud.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6248"><span>「Seriously, you made me really worried. By the way, your acting was so poor with how you held your fist in the victory pose with smile on your face.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6249"><span>「You can’t blame me for that. I was really happy seeing Rimuru being angry for me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6250"><span>Frey shrugs seeing Milim like this. Then she recalls something and says:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6251"><span>「Yeah, I was so nervous when Clayman beat Milim initially. If Milim had not endured, my home would definitely be destroyed. Your forbearance skill is top notch. That is commendable.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6252"><span>She exposes this regarding the whole incident.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6253"><span>So Clayman has beaten Milim more than once. He has hit her more before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6254"><span>I can’t believe such person even exist, is he trying to commit suicide?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6255"><span>「Hmm! Because I am already an adult. An adult who knows how to tolerate!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6256"><span>She emphasizes on the word adult, but she’s still just a kid.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6257"><span>「No way. Never mind, I won’t go after you for it. Besides, did you really endure it just for our agreement? What was your real intention?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6258"><span>「Hmm? Nothing really. I just recalled the weird things Clayman said before. He wanted to make Rimuru into an enemy of the humans and plan a war between human and </span><span>monster</span><span>. It won’t be fun to let him succeed, that’s why I had to interfere!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6259"><span>「Oh, I didn’t expect that you would stand out like this for once….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6260"><span>「WHAHAHAHA! That’s right! I am already an adult!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6261"><span>「Right right right. I’ll take your words for it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6262"><span>So that’s how it was…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6263"><span>Milim’s sharp instinct has made her notice the people behind that manipulates Clayman. Did she pretend to be manipulated in order to find out the real identity of that person?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6264"><span>She seems to also have made some sort of a deal with Frey, I suppose I’ll let the whole deal of fooling me pass.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6265"><span>From this I can conclude that Milim has never once been brainwashed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6266"><span>Not that the effect has been deactivated midway through, it has never worked in the first place.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6267"><span>All of these have been an act. It’s all because Milim was too good at her performance, we can crown her the best actress.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6268"><span>And she even went to the extent of secretly eating pepper in private to maintain her emotionless expression. She has fooled everyone with her natural expression while enduring the horrible taste (of pepper). </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6269"><span>Veldora has seen through her with one glance and played along Milim. He says that he wanted to get familiar with his new body, so he had some fun fighting with Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6270"><span>Veldora seems to have surprisingly high adaptability.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6271"><span>Have you not noticed all these this whole time, Raphael-san?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6272"><span>《..............》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6273"><span>Ah, yes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6274"><span>Now that I think about it, it’s been trying to say something all this time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6275"><span>Raphael-san said that there was no result, now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6276"><span>Since she was never under the control of any spell.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6277"><span>I misunderstood.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6278"><span>I need to listen more carefully to other people’s explanation in the future. I’d better form another habit of listening other people’s words till they finish.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6279"><span>I reflect secretly on the incident.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6280"><span>Then <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> comes and stands before Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6281"><span>「Right, Milim, is it alright for me to ask you something?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6282"><span>「Hmm? Sure, ask away!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6283"><span>Milim answers with a smile.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6284"><span>She is in a good mood with her Dragon Knuckles back.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6285"><span>「It’s not a big deal but I want to confirm something……. Were you really not controlled? Does that mean that you were having fun trolling me as well?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6286"><span>Karion is putting up a smile as veins pop on his forehead.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6287"><span>Hmm, of course he would mind that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6288"><span>「Woo! A-about that…….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6289"><span>「Ahh, don’t be so nervous. It’s okay. It was because I was too weak. But, you did trash my country, was that your idea as well?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6290"><span>Karion didn’t even try to hide his anger and asks Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6291"><span>For an instant, Milim panicked, but——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6292"><span>「Huh! <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, does such insignificant business really matter?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6293"><span>She got mad at him instead.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6294"><span>Seeing this, you know for sure it is Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6295"><span>「Insignificant my ass! Seriously, if you had slipped your hands, I would have died!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6296"><span>「Heh, annoying, you are so annoying! That’s because I was acting too——no, because I was acting so hard to trick Clayman ? That’s why it was all Clayman’s fault!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6297"><span>「Oi oi oi, don’t push all the blame to Clayman now……. Enough. You won’t listen anyway if I complain to you…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6298"><span>I feel much sympathy for <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6299"><span>Seeing <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s manly face now shed with tears, I have the impulse to go comfort him.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6300"><span>I was tricked too, so I can understand how he feels.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6301"><span>「Don’t be sad, <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. The Beastketeers and the rest are all fine and was able to aveng you. They all worked very hard this time. So things are not all bad.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6302"><span>「Oh oh, Rimuru. Sorry I had to trouble you to comfort me.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6303"><span>「Oh, don’t worry. Besides, you can always rebuild your castle. In order to rebuild it, I’ve taken captives of Clayman’s subordinates and will let those Majins do the work for you guys.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6304"><span>「Ah? Oi oi oi, is it true…….?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6305"><span>「Of course it is. We also won’t hold back any of our technical support. And assistance is only natural. That’s why, let us work together to build a more prestigious, more comfortable kingdom!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6306"><span>We have time on our side. I’ve also got a bunch of money from Clayman. I was thinking to use it for future trading, right now it would be a good strategy to give out a few favours.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6307"><span>I was also thinking to build a good relationship through this operation with our neighbouring Beastmen. Allow me to use this opportunity well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6308"><span>「WHA——HAHAHA! That’s wonderful, <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I have also contributed to it!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6309"><span>How did Milim contribute to it at all?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6310"><span>If anything, her contribution is to have wiped out the entire place clean without bricks and stone so the construction work could be conducted more easily.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6311"><span>「My apologies for the trouble, but we are saved! Rimuru——I should call you Rimuru-san. I swear that us Beast Kingdom will maintain a friendly relationship with your country forever, and we will provide you with any assistance!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6312"><span>Karion was surprised and spoke with gratitude on his face. Then he turns back to Milim and warned her along:「I hope you could reflect about all this.」 Milim seems to sense that things have been resolved with fluention and has turned back to her old self.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6313"><span>Should I can her a realist? Never mind, that’s more like Milim anyway.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6314"><span>Anyhow, <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has regained his spirit, so I’ll let things slide.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6315"><span>Besides, it would seem there are more people who are surprised by my words. The Demon Lords surrounding us are also surprised at my speech.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6316"><span>「I can’t believe there is something like this in life. You let those Majins live, aren’t you just too naive…… But it’s an interesting thought nonetheless.

You have been arrogant against the weak and those who can’t resist. I don’t think you are qualified as a Demon Lord. I didn’t interfere because Milim has endured this whole time….. But even I am a little pissed.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6321"><span>Frey lashes out at him coldly and says so. It means she doesn’t plan on saving Clayman, the equivalent of giving him the death sentence.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6322"><span>「That’s right. Even though this is the natural rule of the survival of the fittest, but Clayman, you really crossed the line this time. I’ve got a lot of complaints now that my country has been destroyed.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6323"><span>Karion as well, he is angry at the fact that his country has been bombarded.

I thought I took every step with caution……. Yet I was played by Milim. You guys gave me the seat of Demon Lord because of trust, yet I could only make it to today…….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6338"><span>When he ignored his friends’ advice, he was already destined to end up in this fate.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6339"><span>Such thoughts keep revolving in Clayman’s head.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6340"><span>——Clayman, you are not as strong as us, don’t you go act all stubborn on your own!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6341"><span>——He——Hehehe. Tear is right. Come and find us if you need help.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6342"><span>Ah ah, Tear. Ah ah, Footman. Yeah. I forgot to…....</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6343"><span>He has always placed his dignity with too much importance and never wanted to rely on his companions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6344"><span>No, he has always relied on his companions, yet he threw that idea behind his head at such crucial point of time. That was really uncalled for.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6345"><span>I wanted to become strong just like you guys. Shouldn’t it be natural to be stubborn and strike for it? Because I am a member of the Moderate Clown Troupe after all…….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6346"><span>Indeed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6347"><span>Clayman hopes to receive recognition from his companions.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6348"><span>He hopes they would recognize his power, that’s why he didn’t involve the Moderate Clown Troupe to his schemes. It was truly Clayman’s miscalculation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6349"><span>But, it is all too late…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6350"><span>——He recalls the first time he met “That Lord”.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6351"><span>「Hey, are you Clayman?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6352"><span>「Who are you? How dare you call my name like that, do you have a death wish?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6353"><span>「Oi oi oi, you don’t have to raise your guard like that. I got here because of someone’s recommendation.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6354"><span>「Recommendation?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6355"><span>「Yeah. The one recommending was your boss, Demon Lord Kazaream.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6356"><span>「What did you say?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6357"><span>Clayman was planning to kill this young man, yet he has called out a memorable name——Kazaream. That’s when Clayman began to have interest in hearing the young man to speak.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6358"><span>Then he learnt something.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6359"><span>He learnt his ambition and his abilities.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6360"><span>「——That’s how it is. I must control this world. Come and assist me in doing so, Clayman?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6361"><span>「He-hehahahaha. Interesting, is this perhaps a request?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6362"><span>「Yes. A request for the 『Moderate Clown Troupe』.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6363"><span>「And the reward?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6364"><span>「To revive Demon Lord Kazaream, how about it?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6365"><span>This reward is more than he could ask for, so there was no reason to turn it down.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6366"><span>He knew what the young man is capable of and recognized the plan to be feasible. There was nothing to doubt.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6367"><span>Clayman made up his mind then to take on the contract.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6368"><span>「I know you will take it. Let us collaborate in taking this world into our pocket. When the time comes, we can all live in this world happily ever after!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6369"><span>Seeing “That Lord” wishing to turn the world into a game to enjoy its fun, Clayman believes such idea may come true one day.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6370"><span>They must overcome layers of obstacles. But it is precisely because of that this task seemed so fun.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6371"><span>He thought so originally, yet now his misstep has costed the entire plan to foil.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6372"><span>It was rare already that the reward has been paid——Demon Lord Kazaream was successfully revived…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6373"><span>My carelessness has led things to this point today. Then, I won’t even have ground to excuse myself…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6374"><span>Kazaream went through all the trouble to be revived, yet Clayman couldn’t even find a chance to congratulate him now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6375"><span>This is all his own doing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6376"><span>He was ordered to stay put, yet Clayman has acted on his own and ignored the order.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6377"><span>At last, he thought of that man’s words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6378"><span>The wise words from Clayman’s respected and beloved Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6379"><span>——Clayman. You and I are a lot like each other, so it’s fine to set me as your model, but never ever inherit my shortcomings as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6380"><span>He should have thought about that long ago. That was the motto he deemed as truth.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6381"><span>Ah ah……. Kazaream-sama….. I’m sorry. I’ve forgotten your advice and made the fatal misstep…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6382"><span>Indeed, Clayman has taken the wrong move and made the worst choices.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6383"><span>Just like Demon Lord Kazaream, he has lost to a new Demon Lord, inherited his trait of doing stupid things.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6384"><span>That is karma.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6385"><span>It is the miscalculation that Clayman hated the most.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6386"><span>I couldn’t even save the army you borrowed me, I’ve lost them because of my miscalculation…… I can’t die, not just yet. I won’t forgive myself to die without any legacy like this…...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6387"><span>As things have progressed, he at least needs to spread out the intelligences he gathered from his enemies. This has prompted an idea to rise in the heart of the desperate and almost given up Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6388"><span>——You the Undead Elf created through my body, but I’ve done the most work on your head. Unlike Footman and Tear, you are not suitable for combat. However, you are the only one who would take the role of strategizing and commanding the army. That’s why Clayman, you should be the Demon Lord——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6389"><span>He has let down Demon Lord Kazaream’s expectation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6390"><span>If he didn’t have enough power, he would only need to acquire it. Then, he would be on the same ground with Footman and Tear. No, he would surpass them in strength.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6391"><span>Once Clayman who’s quick in the head acquires power, he would excel more than them.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6392"><span>Right, that’s it. It doesn’t matter if I can’t awake to become True Demon Lord. That’s why, please grant me power. Grant me power……. Grant me the invincible power————!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6393"><span>《Confirmed. Transforming souls to magicule……...Successful.

What are you doing, mister??</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6682"><span>「What do you mean by that? I’m just a loyal maid to Demon Lord Valentine-sama.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6683"><span>Her voice is cold, cold as her expression——as Milus responds to Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6684"><span>「Hey, you can’t do that! Valentine’s been hiding her true identity, Veldora, you shouldn’t expose other people like that!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6685"><span>Eh, Milim-san? Aren’t you the one who’s exposing other people?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6686"><span>I was already skeptical about it before and it would seem my guess was correct.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6687"><span>The beautiful girl wearing maid suit, Milus, is the real Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6688"><span>Her sights alone now could kill. That is the type of stare Milus is giving Milim right now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6689"><span>「Ahh!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6690"><span>Milim seems to have realized and begins to awkwardly whisper, trying to muddle through.</span></p><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image23.png" title="" height="808" width="551" class="line" id="line_6691"><p class="line" id="line_6692"><span>You aren’t even whispering out any sounds. Plus, it’s no use for you to do something like that now. Milus doesn't seem to be the joking type, you probably can’t have her forgive you after doing something like that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6693"><span>Milus menacingly glares around her surrounding.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6694"><span>Her eyes tell that she wishes to kill everyone present to dispose of &nbsp;the witnesses.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6695"><span>She seems like the aggressive and dangerous type. But luckily Milus decides to give up the idea so as to not make her a public enemy here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6696"><span>「Gee, you blasted evil dragon, ruining my</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Ruminas is using “” which is how noble usually address themselves. Same for Roy Valentine" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;work every single time…… Also, did you even forget my real name? You sure are irritating. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6697"><span>Milus——no, Demon Lord Valentine says so with her intimidating aura unleashed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6698"><span>Veldora sure is casual, even remembering other people’s name wrong. That probably have provoked Valentine even more. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6699"><span>「Enough. You may call me Valentine.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6700"><span>Valentine announces so with much displeasure. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6701"><span>Immediately after, she releases an immense amount of magic and changes her appearance instantly. Her maid suit disappears, and instead it was replaced with a luxurious black gothic dress.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6702"><span>That’s magical dress change——The quick clothes change magic that MIlim is also good at.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6703"><span>And a girl with heavenly beauty appears before us.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6704"><span>Ah, of course. The real deal is indeed different.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6705"><span>The male Valentine is rather strong too, but the difference between the two is heaven and earth. The Demon Lord with both beauty and power thus enters the scene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6706"><span>「Roy, you can go back first.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6707"><span>Valentine displays the style of a king and orders the current Demon Lord Valentine after her dress change. It would seem that the Demon Lord valentine here is called Roy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6708"><span>「But, Valentine-sama——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6709"><span>「There’s no point in keep acting now after &nbsp;we’ve been exposed in front of so many people.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6710"><span>Valentine asserts so while staring at Veldora. Veldora is looking all awkward and mumbling &nbsp;「It’s not my fault, none of my business….」and tries to avoid eye contact with Valentine. These are barely excuses.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6711"><span>And the one who started all this, Milim, has it out of her mind completely now. To Milim, that’s likely just a past event. Her habit of doing whatever she wants really can’t be changed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6712"><span>But she probably knows better than anyone that Valentine, apart from her rage, has no intention to extend her complaints any further.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6713"><span>Now she’s changed her mood and gave some strict orders to Roy, who now is simply an underling:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6714"><span>「Besides, there’s something on my mind right now. That guy Clayman has laid eyes on you, and his vision was freezed for a second. This may have something to do with the pest that invaded our territory. Go back and inform everyone to stay on guard.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6715"><span>She says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6716"><span>According to her, it would seem then Clayman has been meddling in other people’s business all this time. No wonder he is disliked so much.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6717"><span>Perhaps he’s just trying to find out more about the unknown domain of Valentine, what a reckless guy. Such love for information collecting is playing with fire.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6718"><span>「——Understood.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6719"><span>After his response, Roy leaves alone to return to his country.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6720"><span>He didn’t disobey Valentine’s order. This means that Roy has little reluctance for the seat of Demon Lord and was indeed just a body-double.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6721"><span>This also shows the authority wielded by the real Valentine.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6722"><span>As such, Valentine returns to the her Demon Lord throne once more. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6723"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6724"><span>Now let’s restore everything to normal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6725"><span>I take out the round table from 「Stomach」and place it properly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6726"><span>It was the right call to absorb it to protect it from breaking. If we had broken out fighting without such preparation in the fighting area, it would definitely damage the table. It looks quite expensive so I have no intention to compensate for breaking it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6727"><span>The Demon Lords return to the round table while the two maids working for Guy begin to serve everyone with red tea.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6728"><span>Leon, slanting his eyes at the scene suddenly speaks:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6729"><span>「——ah, now I recall. The name Kazaream sounds awfully familiar. It was the Demon Lord that I killed.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6730"><span>I almost spit out the red tea I just drank.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6731"><span>How could Leon just suddenly say that in monotone without a single bit of emotion?!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6732"><span>「Do you know him, Leon?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6733"><span>How come YOU don’t know about him, Milim-san?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6734"><span>The rest of the Demon Lords have a similar reaction to hers.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6735"><span>Who’s that supposed to be? The majority think so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6736"><span>Even Ramiris has completely forgotten about him. Don’t you have any memory to those things? I want to tease her about that, but I digress out of pity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6737"><span>——So where did the name Kazaream come from?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6738"><span>《...... Answer. Clayman just called out to a number of people. One of the name was 「Kazaream」.》</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6739"><span>Oh yeah! Now I recall.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6740"><span>Which other name did he call out now… Just to clarify, I remember everything very clearly, please don’t treat me as the likes of Milim and Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6741"><span>「So what would be the relationship between this Kazaream and Clayman?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6742"><span>I attempted to ask and got an answer from <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6743"><span>「Kazaream was the 『Cursed King』. Milim, didn’t you and Kazaream recommend me to become a Demon Lord?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6744"><span>「Oh, it’s that guy. I remember there was a 『Cursed King』. Right, he’s the Demon Lord that Leon killed.」. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6745"><span>She can’t remember the name but still recalls the title. That’s somewhat acceptable I guess.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6746"><span>So that’s the only Demon Lord Leon has beaten. But in my view, she must have forgotten because it is unimportant….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6747"><span>「Yeah, I remember Kazaream was an Undead Elf</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;妖死族 デスマン (Death man) - SInce it’s explained that it’s a type of undead evolved from elves I would translate it to undead elf. (more information on the race in volume 10)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;just like Clayman. And it’s the mutated species of elves that evolved through their own efforts. I used to have some connection with him in private and heard that Clayman took over Kazaream’s territory. From that we can infer the two are connected secretly.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6748"><span>Karion reminiscents of the past and turns to tell me that. It seems <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thinks Kazaream is not as bad as Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6749"><span>Wow, right, wait a second? I almost skipped through that, but since Kazaream is also undead elf...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6750"><span>「Could it be that Kazaream is still alive? Did he pretend to be killed by Leon and in reality, have hidden himself somewhere else?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6751"><span>「Hmm, that guy is capable of that indeed. Kazaream, he’s a much more difficult guy to deal with than Clayman. He is a smart man.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6752"><span>Karion agrees to my view, so I think it’s likely the case.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6753"><span>「You say it as if I had intentionally let him slip. Unbelievable. He used to proclaim so arrogantly that he will assist me to become a Demon Lord one day as long as I serve under his reign. I didn’t even bother to refuse and simplu took his place by defeating. Whether he’s dead or alive now is none of my concern.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6754"><span>Leon says so without any shame.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6755"><span>I suppose Leon just wanted to show his strength instead of actually killing Kazaream. That’s why he doesn’t care about his status now.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6756"><span>「Oi oi oi, Leon. It must be because this kind of attitude of yours that Clayman hated you so much.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6757"><span>「Huh, I’m not interested.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6758"><span>Karioin decides to advise Leon but was met with a cold answer. But it probably would only trouble Leon more.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6759"><span>Speaking of which, I didn’t know Clayman was working against Leon as well, he sure had a lot of enemies. Is he really a smart guy? I become more and more skeptical. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6760"><span>But if that’s the case, I seem to have a rough idea of what Kazaream and Clayman’s plan is.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6761"><span>I heard that it’s been around two hundred years since Leon become a Demon Lord, and apart from helping <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Clayman becoming Demon Lord, Kazaream likely wanted to have more companions within the Demon Lord rank.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6762"><span>It is probably for that reason that Clayman carried out the plan to turn orc lord into a Demon Lord. It is to have more people to help out and have more of a presence during the Banquet.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6763"><span>This type of idea of creating big group of comrade seems to be quite scummy and isn’t appropriate for a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6764"><span>But it is indeed an effective plan, so I could understand..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6765"><span>「Among Clayman’s companions, there is an organization called 『The Moderate Clown Troupe』. They seem to receive assistance from humans and it’s likely the revived Kazaream has possessed onto some human.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6766"><span>I begin to explain my theory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6767"><span>Having been defeated by Leon, Kazaream’s body seemed to have been destroyed. This is why in order to revive himself, it must start with his astral body.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6768"><span>If that was the case, he would naturally want to possess onto other living being.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6769"><span>Besides, if he had revived in the resident area of other Demon Lords, he would have been discovered immediately. Kazaream, who has yet to be discovered till this day, must have hid somewhere other than the domains of Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6770"><span>「Maybe that’s the case. Leon’s attack could even destroy spiritual body. It’s rather commendable that Kazaream was even able to figure out a way to survive. Moreover, it would take several hundred years’ time for even us, the Demon race, to revive from our soul form. It’s definitely worse for Undead Elf. So it’s unlikely that he was able to revive himself with his own strength. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6771"><span>Guy surprisingly agrees to my view.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6772"><span>Unlike spiritual life form such as Demon race, the Undead relies on flesh. This is why the revival of his astral body requires a lot of time. It’s a miracle that he was even able to survive.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6773"><span>That is Guy’s explanation summarized.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6774"><span>In other words, it’s highly possible that someone has been assisting him</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6775"><span>But there isn’t any reliable source of information regarding these connections behind the scene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6776"><span>「Anyhow, we’ll leave it like this for now. Regardless, we must assume now that Kazaream has been revived. Stay on alert. Clayman has been killed, so I would think he will probably hate me a lot.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6777"><span>「WHAHAHAHA! Rimuru, you are quite strong, so don’t worry about it!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6778"><span>「Idiot! Don’t you know you will get defeated for being so careless!?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6779"><span>Milim suddenly replies as I spoke.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6780"><span>In a way I responded so to serve as a reminder for myself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6781"><span>Our grand victory today wiped out all of Clayman’s forces, so I’d think the enemies won’t take any action any time soon. But I can’t get careless now. It’s fine if they go after me alone, but right now I have companions to take care of.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6782"><span>I need to put more thoughts into defense in the future and draft some response strategies.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6783"><span>&nbsp;*** </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6784"><span>The short break ended with the meeting once again held.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6785"><span>Clayman who was previously the host of meeting has now been forcefully retired. So Guy took his place and host the meeting. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6786"><span>「Our topic of discussion today is the betrayal of <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the rise of the Rimuru guy over there. And all these issues have been resolved. <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> never betrayed us and Rimuru has shown power worthy of the role of Demon Lord. I think the meeting is done so far. But since it’s a rather rare occasion, does anyone have any suggestion to make?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6787"><span>Frey begins to speak, seemingly awaiting that line.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6788"><span>「Could you allow me to speak for a moment? Right now we are during the middle of our meeting, so I have a suggestion to make, or rather, a request to make, I suppose.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6789"><span>「Fair enough, have at you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6790"><span>Seeing Guy has approved, Frey nods and proceeds:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6791"><span>「From today onward, I’ve decided to follow Milim’s rule. Based on that, I would like to give out my seat as a Demon Lord.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6792"><span>Such it’s the big shocker she just tossed out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6793"><span>「Oi oi oi, why are you saying this all of a sudden?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6794"><span>「Wait, Frey! How come I never heard you mention about this?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6795"><span>「Indeed, I’ve kept silent. But, I’ve been thinking about it for sometime now.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6796"><span>Frey squeezes her eyes and drifts afar as she speaks.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6797"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6798"><span>Frey recalls to herself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6799"><span>She was talking to Milim then. Their conversation made Frey determine to have faith in Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6800"><span>「Let me ask you this, Frey. Would you like to be my friend?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6801"><span>「——Why do you ask that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6802"><span>「Because I made a friend like Rimuru! Friends are really amazing, they help each other out all the time.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6803"><span>「Well now, is that so? About that, Milim…… If you are willing to help me, I would like to be your friend then.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6804"><span>「Really! Then I will definitely agree to you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6805"><span>「Haha, that’s pleasing. However, I am rather cautious. So if you are willing to follow a “promise”, then I’ll trust you.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6806"><span>「Alright I know! Then we can be friends together!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6807"><span>Frey doesn’t trust Clayman, that’s why she chose to believe Milim. She gets to keep herself safe while pretending to have accepted Clayman’s advice.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6808"><span>If Milim didn’t follow the promise, had she actually been manipulated…….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6809"><span>Although she feels unease, Frey decided to gamble on Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6810"><span>And so in the end, it was her victory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6811"><span>That is the reason.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6812"><span>The reason why Frey decides to put her faith in Milim and follow her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6813"><span>This lone and arrogant Queen has not trusted anyone before, and this is the first time she entrusts herself to any individual.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6814"><span>*</span><span>**</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6815"><span>Frey seems to have recalled something and had a chuckle about it. Then, she announces with determination:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6816"><span>「Anyhow, there’s a lot of reasons for why. But the most important one of them is that I feel like I am too weak to be a Demon Lord. After witnessing that battle just now, I was further convinced. If I am to fight against Clayman, I could barely manage to make it a draw in the end. Not to add that Clayman became awakened mid-fight, so there’s no way I could have won...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6817"><span>「But Frey, aren’t you good at high-speed aerial combat? Is there really a need to look down on yourself like that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6818"><span>Dagruel tries to defend her, but Frey seems already determined.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6819"><span>「Indeed, I’m more advantageous in aerial combat. But that’s no excuse for not being a Demon Lord. Moreover, I know it’s not enough to just have some advantages——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6820"><span>Upon saying so, Frey peeks at me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6821"><span>***</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6822"><span>Then she proceeds with the words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6823"><span>「——So, that’s why I decided to work under Milim. Besides, Milim can’t always act so stubborn, right? She needs to learn how to run her own territory now, shouldn’t she?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6824"><span>That means Frey isn’t saying so just for her own sake.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6825"><span>Milim is indeed a dangerous individual that can’t be let loose on her own. There needs to be someone who can assist her and watch over her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6826"><span>Frey understands her short-coming. But in my view, she’s not as weak as she describes. It can be said that she is a different type of strategist from Clayman, one whose ideas can’t be seen through. It’s quite terrifying when you think about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6827"><span>In anyhow, she is the typical type of person that let you go “women are terrifying”. I suppose that’s why I feel she’s particularly scary.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6828"><span>But what would really happen if that’s the case (Frey serving Milim)?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6829"><span>If she is no longer a Demon Lord but proceeds as a servant. Her combat ability is undoubtedly worthy of Milim. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6830"><span>There is no recognized nation under Milim’s name, but would she now possess territory once Frey becomes her subordinate?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6831"><span>When the time comes for me to build an alliance with Milim’s country, the engagement may be complicated with Frey’s involvement.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6832"><span>Or rather, it would be more interesting that way.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6833"><span>「So, do you accept my proposition?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6834"><span>Frey looks towards Milim as she continues her speech.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6835"><span>「B-but, I don’t give out visas…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6836"><span>Milim doesn’t know what to do.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6837"><span>But as she attempts to reject the proposition——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6838"><span>「Hold your horses. I’ve got something to say about this as well.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6839"><span>With such statement, <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> joins in their conversation,</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6840"><span>「I, too, has lost to Milim during a duel. I think life is all about being straightforward, so I want to surrender to her. In terms of our titles, the Demon Lords have the same place. It’s a different case when fighting against a Chosen Hero, But now I’ve lost to another Demon Lord, so I ought to step down. Which means there’s no excuse for me to keep being a Demon Lord. That’s why now I’ll be Milim’s subordinate from now on. Please take care of me, BOSS! 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6841"><span>This one just decides to straight up ignore her personal will.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6842"><span>I understand that power is everything to all the Demon Lords, but this is just….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6843"><span>Milim doesn’t take any subordinate and so she won’t get objection from them.

You did just say “It’s impossible to manipulate me!”, and you said it so confidently!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6849"><span>Karion’s impersonation is really on point and was able to reenact Milim’s words.

We get to be together forever in that way. And we get to do more fun things together.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6855"><span>She begins to brainwash Milim with such things——Trying to instigate her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6856"><span>You see, it’s this type of things that makes you cautious around her.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6857"><span>As for <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he does have a strong personal style and cuts to the trace:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6858"><span>「Bottom line is, it’s all because you’ve trashed my kingdom to shreds! Rimuru-san promised to helps us, but you’d also have the duty to take care of us.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6859"><span>I don’t think that type of duty exist, but Milim seems to be clueless against this type of logic. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6860"><span>Karion, is surprisingly witty.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6861"><span>Milim seems to have taken <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words for it and almost fainted. But then she bursts out as if she doesn’t want to care about any of this anymore.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6862"><span>「So ANNOYING——! Alight, alright, whatever you guys want!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6863"><span>Smoke begins to flow out from Milim’s head like the eruption of a volcano. Milim.exe has stopped working.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6864"><span>Sasuga Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6865"><span>She seems smart but never actually uses her brain.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6866"><span>「<span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, do you really wish to do that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6867"><span>「Of course. I’ve thought through a lot already. I don’t intend to retire from being the king of the beast kingdom. I merely wish to pursue Milim and build up a new system.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6868"><span>Karion gave a simple and clear answer to Guy’s question.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6869"><span>「I was rather fond of you. Perhaps you’ll also awake given another couple hundred years and I was looking forward to it.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6870"><span>Guy sighs through his nose and says so with disappointment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6871"><span>But he immediately switches to a smile and announces.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6872"><span>「Very well! From now on, Frey and <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are no longer Demon Lords. You two can go server Milim as you desire.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6873"><span>With Guy’s words out, the two are officially released from the duty of Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6874"><span>No one present seem to object.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6875"><span>And of course, I’m none the wiser.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6876"><span>And so, I’ve officially been approved and inaugurated as Demon Lord. I eliminated another one alongside with the retirement of two other, who decided to be Milim’s subordinates.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6877"><span>The Ten Great Demon Lords are now Eight Great Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6878"><span>***</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6879"><span>And just as I thought the meeting is over, there seems to be another issue to resolve in the end.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6880"><span>I said it without much care and started the whole ordeal.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6881"><span>「Oh yeah, so it’s not Ten Great Demon Lords anymore.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6882"><span>This quickly sparked responses from all the Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6883"><span>「That’s quite annoying indeed. It’s a matter of prestige, so we’ve got to come up with a new title.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6884"><span>Dagruel says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6885"><span>Eh? Is it really that important?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6886"><span>「Glad that the banquet has yet to be dismissed. Now that all the Demon Lords are gathered, we may come up with some good ideas.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6887"><span>Even Valentine who doesn’t take jokes lightly begins to follow with a serious expression.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6888"><span>Oi oi oi, we don’t need to be that cautious with something like titles.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6889"><span>Even if we let it slide, the humans will definitely make up names for us by themselves.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6890"><span>「We’ve gone drained our brain doing this last time. Everytime we decide to change our name the number of members just keep fluctuating. And then several banquets just pass with no result——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6891"><span>Ehhhh! Did you guys seriously hold the Banquet just for some boring trivia like that?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6892"><span>I recall Ramiris was being exaggerated when she mentioned that the banquet is a special meeting that all Demon Lords must attend…… that doesn’t seem right, or is it just simply a tea party in the beginning.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6893"><span>I feel whatever changes would be okay.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6894"><span>「Yeah, like the last title 『Ten Great Demon Lords』 was in the end how the humans call us. We wasted so much brain cells just trying to come up with a name. So leave me out of this one, I’ve got no more strength to spare——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6895"><span>No no no, whether you can do it is a different thing..You are just too lazy to think at all.So stop saying that as if you’ve gone through much serious contemplations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6896"><span>「Quite, people. All you’ve been doing is complaining. There isn’t anything constructive at all!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6897"><span>「What do you mean by that Valentine. You sure talk the talk when you push all the work to Roy.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6898"><span>Valentines says so which resonates with me, yet it was countered with a single line from Dino. Unlike Milim or Ramiris, this lazy bone here has sharp words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6899"><span>But why would it cost so much time just trying to come up with a name. Or rather, they seem all so pumped up by it, could the Demon Lords be really bored in life?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6900"><span>After asking around I learnt that it took them several years to settle for a name last time. But as they were halfway through, the humans began to call them 「Ten Great Demon Lords」. Thus the Demon Lords in favour of naming drastically decrease. As long as they can come up with a good name, they seem to be fine with moderating the number of Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6901"><span>And so they decided to use the title officially, but not everyone was fine with how it sounded.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6902"><span>That’s one nonchalant info.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6903"><span>「You guys need to calm down now. It is time like this we need to show some comradery to sail through difficult times together, unlike how we usually behave. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6904"><span>Guy was straight to the point about their lack of unity in most days.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6905"><span>Ramiris begins to mumble to herself hearing Guy’s word.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6906"><span>「Eh, but…. This time is, Eight Great——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6907"><span>Even though she says so, her mumbling dies down under the immense silent pressure exerted by the rest of the crowd.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6908"><span>She then restarted with something else: 「Ah yes. What a great speech by Guy! Let’s work hard together now!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6909"><span>Everyone seems to be against the title Eight Great Demon Lords.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6910"><span>But, this is not a symbol of unity.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6911"><span>「WHAHAHA! I’ll leave this task to you!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6912"><span>「I’m tired, time for bed.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6913"><span>It didn’t take long before the unfitting bunch starts to appear one by one.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6914"><span>But I should have guessed that, they are Demon Lords indeed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6915"><span>I’d say it would be an impossible mission to unite them all, and my guess was right.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6916"><span>However, someone suddenly appeared to break this awkward atmosphere.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6917"><span>This brainlet of a man now stands right behind me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6918"><span>「Oh? If that’s the issue, my friend Rimuru is pretty good at it!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6919"><span>It’s Veldora.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6920"><span>Veldora who has started to feel bored and wanted to go back soon, said this out of nowhere.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6921"><span>OH NOO, the Demon Lords’ eyes now have all fixated on .me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6922"><span>Why don’t you go read you damn manga instead of spilling nonsense here. But, could it be that he has finished all his manga? Even the last volume?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6923"><span>Milim has her eyes locked on Veldora, no, Veldora’s mangas in his hands. Those eyes are sharper than those of eagles’ when locking on prey, causing me to feel a lot of unease.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6924"><span>But it’s not the time to worry about that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6925"><span>Someone agreeing with Veldora appears.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6926"><span>It’s Ramiris.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6927"><span>「Speaking of that, he also named my Beretta super fast!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6928"><span>Now she’s tossed me the hot potato with all those nonsense.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6929"><span>This girl….. She’s getting more and more casual with me. It vaguely reflects a sense of dependence she’s growing towards me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6930"><span>While I turn unconsciously, the rest of the Demon Lords are also looking at me with expectation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6931"><span>This is bad. I’ve been surrounded!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6932"><span>The Demon Lords exchange looks and Guy stands up to speak in everyone’s name.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6933"><span>「Rimuru, the newly risen Demon Lord, today I shall grant you an epic special privilege.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6934"><span>「Ah, no thanks. I don’t need that.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6935"><span>I attempt to cut him up as soon as possible. However, my imaginations were too naive. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6936"><span>Chong-dong! As I hear the loud noise, The giant round table that reflects with textures of obsidian and looks quite expensive is now severed in half with by someone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6937"><span>Guy ignores my rejection with a smile and continues:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6938"><span>「Of course you need it, the privilege to create a new title for us. This is of great honor, you must really want to accept it, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6939"><span>He walks towards me casually and proclaims to me and fondles my cheek.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6940"><span>Is this some sort of flighty display to ask for a favour?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6941"><span>Although he looks gentle like water, his tone sounds irrefusable.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6942"><span>I am speechless. Neither could I accept nor could I reject, so I decide to exercise my rights to remain silence, however….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6943"><span>Guy starts to pushing against my cheek hard with his fingers, while biting my ears and whispers: 「By the way, aren’t you the way causing our layoffs of members today? You will take responsibility and help think up a name now, won’t you?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6944"><span>It may seem to the rest is some lover wanting to get spoiled, but it’s not the case at all.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6945"><span>This is a threat!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6946"><span>Alas, I couldn’t refuse anyway considering how everything went.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6947"><span>I can’t believe how troublesome this has become.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6948"><span>Never mind.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6949"><span>「Alright, alright. Gosh. Then don’t complain later that you don’t like the name I make.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6950"><span>I took the task with much unwillingness after giving up struggling.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6951"><span>The Demon Lords are all with smiling faces as if saying 「That’s great, now we are reassured.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6952"><span>Some people even ask for more tea and decide to rest from then on. They always like to push their work to other people.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6953"><span>Fine then, I won’t care about them either.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6954"><span>We are eight Demon Lords in total, so Eight Great Demon Lord is okay…. But, it seems a bit too straight forward.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6955"><span>Whatever Ramiris was just about to say is probably Eight Great Demon Lords, so I’d refrain from using that. After all, you could feel the immense pressure emitted from the rest of the group, telling her to stop. I definitely won’t make it now if I get those threatening stares.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6956"><span>So “Eight Great Demon Lords” is a no go.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6957"><span>Then….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6958"><span>Speaking of which, tonight is the new moon.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6959"><span>The shining stars in the night sky are very pretty——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6960"><span>「How about 『Eight-Star Demon Lords』(Octagram)? You can say it’s an inspiration from Eight awn star。」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6961"><span>With that being said, a period of silence dawns the scene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6962"><span>The Demon Lords all begin to close their eyes and think over these words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6963"><span>Then, everyone opens up their eyes.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6964"><span>「That would be it, it sounds very nice.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6965"><span>「We can definitely win with this name! A new age has arrived!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6966"><span>「That’s right! I know Rimuru could do it!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6967"><span>「You sure knows your stuff. As expected from candidate nominated by Veldora.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6968"><span>「Oh, sounds alright. Then I shall agree with you a little.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6969"><span>「You got it in an instance! That’s pretty cool. I don’t know why we wasted so much time on this last time.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6970"><span>「......Hmm *</span><span>Dino Approval Sound</span><span>*.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6971"><span>There doesn’t seem to be any objection.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6972"><span>That’s great. And if anyone would like to object, I’ll have him think of a name.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6973"><span>Although I don’t know who Milim is trying compete with or win. It’s a bit concerning but I won’t go after it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6974"><span>Also Dino, I want to ask you what the blaze were you all discussing before….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6975"><span>Some of the people here’s reaction raises a lot of question for me, but I manage to play dumb like an adult to make it through.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6976"><span>Just like that——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6977"><span>From the moment onward, the Demon Lords introduce themselves with a new title to be respected by the world.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6978"><span>***</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="line" id="line_6979"><span>The so called Octagram, Eight-Star Demon Lord——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6980"><span>Demon ——「Lord of Darkness」Guy Crimson</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6981"><span>Dragonoid —— 「Destroyer」Milim Nava</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6982"><span>Fairy —— 「Fairy of Labyrinth」Ramiris</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Katakana of title is “Labyrinth”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_6983"><span>Titan —— 「Fury of Earth」Dagruel</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Katakana of title is “Earthquake”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_6984"><span>Vampire —— 「Queen of Nightmare」Valentine</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6985"><span>Fallen Angel —— 「Sleeping Ruler」Dino</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6986"><span>Ex-Human —— 「Platinum Saber」Leon Cromwell</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6987"><span>And me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6988"><span>Monster —— 「Newbie」Rimuru Tempest</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Rimuru’s race here is “妖魔 (Youma)”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><p class="line" id="line_6989"><span>—— In total, eight members as mentioned above.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6990"><span>From today onward, the new age of Demon Lords has arrived.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6991"><span>But first, we need to divide territory.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6992"><span>My domain would be the entirety of Jura Great Forest.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6993"><span>That’s a nice treatment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6994"><span>But, Milim got it better.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6995"><span>The combined territory of Frey, <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Clayman is now under Milim’s control.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6996"><span>But she only rules it in name.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6997"><span>The inner work of the territory would be runned by <span data-term="Karion" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Frey and the Worshippers of Dragon who follow Milim.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_6998"><span>In addition, the previous territory belonged to Clayman now falls in the buffer zone with the territory of eastern empire.

He escaped without hesitation and was able to save his ass.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7025"><span>How could he be motivated at all to explore the 「Inner sanctum」, the mission was a failure.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7026"><span>But, it’s not Laplace’s fault.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7027"><span>And just when I thought demon lord Valentine is out…. I won’t stand a chance if that woman is guarding the place…</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7028"><span>「How the hell I am supposed to win against that type of monster——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7029"><span>Laplace mumbles, he’s already given up and decided to retreat.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7030"><span>Speaking of which……. Laplace thinks to himself—— I’ve been running away a lot lately.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7031"><span>I am good enough to be able to escape from Hinata——he wants to praise himself that, but he still feels rather conflicted. Lately his luck has been on the down side, so he’d better not get cocky now and thinks he’d be able to escape——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7032"><span>Laplace’s thoughts was paused at that moment when he senses a strong shockwave of magic while seeing a distortion of space outside in the surrounding of <span data-term="Ruberios" class="underline clickable" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_7033"><span>「Ehhh…..no..way…….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7034"><span>I’m dead——Laplace wants to cry.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7035"><span>Whatever is causing the phenomenon is already far beyond the realm of higher majin, it’s clearly a powerful individual on a different level. Moreover, Laplace is somewhat familiar with that wavelength. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_7036"><span>「Trash, how dare you show yourself before me again!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7037"><span>The rage of Demon Lord Valentine burn, his furious shouts spread all around Laplace.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7038"><span>「Damn it! And now we get a demon lord!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7039"><span>This is the worst, Laplace wants to exclaim out loud for his misfortune. But right now, there’s no time for such things. He again braces himself to escape with all he has.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7040"><span>「Huh! You trashes are all the same. Why are you all so fond of running away?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7041"><span>——At that instant, Laplace is bestranged by the words of Valentine. He stops his footstep..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7042"><span>「What do you mean by that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7043"><span>「Huh, it’s none of your business, but I’ll tell you anyway. Just now, Demon Lord Clayman is dead. That moronic, treacherous trash is just like you, running around with his tails tucked. He even cried embarrassingly in the end.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7044"><span>Valentine spitted out the line, unimpressed and mockingly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7045"><span>「WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7046"><span>「Hahaha, why are you getting so pumped up about it? This is none of your business, right?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7047"><span>「Shut your mouth! Oi, you said Clayman is dead, is it true?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7048"><span>「Ha————HAHAHA! Trash, now you’ve slipped up. Of course you are all in this together. Everything is as Ruminas-sama predicted!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7049"><span>Laplace is frozen in shock watching Valentine laughed out loud.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7050"><span>Clayman is dead, he can’t quite process that for the moment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7051"><span>It’s not exactly impossible to believe, but he’s not willing to do that. To Laplace, Clayman may be a bit psycho at times, but he’s still his companion who shares the same dream and ambition, more importantly, a good friend to Laplace.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7052"><span>「What are you laughing at, you bastard!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7053"><span>「Trash, who do you think…………. Guwu——!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7054"><span>「YOU SONUVABITCH! STOP LAUGHING AT MY FRIEND!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7055"><span>Beaten to death with bare hands.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7056"><span>That would be the words most suited to describe the scene. Laplace’s fists did not stop for an instant.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7057"><span>「Wuu, don’t get all cocky now, you trash!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7058"><span>Valentine’s face started to turn red due to the anger and humiliation, shouting and staring at Laplace.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7059"><span>The opponent it’s Valentine who possesses 「Ultraspeed regeneration」, no matter how you beat me it won’t work at all. The fools must be punished and killed. Valentine thinks to himself.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7060"><span>He unconsciously rubs away the blood that has splashed out, no, he was turning the blood into a red mist of blood fog, spreading it to the surrounding——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7061"><span>「Go to hell, 『Blood Flash Shock Wave』!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7062"><span>——Being trapped in the inescapable blood barrier, the blood beam fired towards Laplace who is impossible to escape——Yet it didn’t go as he wished.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7063"><span>「It’s futile, you are already dead.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7064"><span>「——Wuu!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7065"><span>Valentine couldn’t react in time. He, who possesses immense power is being played by such low life trash. He planned on using his strongest skill to take his life, yet strangely, his ability is not activated. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_7066"><span>Tonight is indeed the night of new moon, it is the day when Valentine has the least amount of power. But it matters very little when you’ve reached a level such as demon lord.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7067"><span>Perhaps the weakening didn’t really have a impact. Then, there is only one logical explanation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7068"><span>Laplace is very strong.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7069"><span>That explanation is quite correct indeed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7070"><span>Laplace is holding something in his hand, something that is still beating.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7071"><span>「——Wuu!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7072"><span>「That’s right, this is your heart (core) that I hold in my hand. You can’t move now, can’t even make a sound, right? This is all my work. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7073"><span>He announces that cruelly.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7074"><span>Unknowingly, Valentine’s body starts to tremble. Almost if…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7075"><span>Is, is this fear? Am I afraid?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7076"><span>「You are rather late to realize that. Yeah, I’m pretty strong.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7077"><span>Color begins to fade on Valentine’s face and he begins to show a desperate expression.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7078"><span>What Laplace is holding is indeed my heart——Valentine realizes that in shock and realizes his defeat. Seeing the expression on his opponent, Laplace begins to laugh hysterically and smashes the heart into bits.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7079"><span>The victory has been settled.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7080"><span>Laplace won’t stop laughing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7081"><span>——Ah ah, Footman is gonna be pissed.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7082"><span>He laughs as he kills off all the guards who discovered him. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_7083"><span>——Ah ah, Tear is definitely gonna cry.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7084"><span>He bears his head deep and attempts to escape.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7085"><span>——That’s why, I’m going to laugh.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7086"><span>He thinks 「You are one big dumbass」, this is Laplace’s teasing of Clayman.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7087"><span>Because he thinks, that’s the best way to send off 「The Laughing Clown」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7088"><span>He won’t be angry and won’t cry.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7089"><span>He will laugh in place of his friend who can no longer laugh. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_7090"><span>Laplace laughs.</span></p><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image4.png" title="" height="792" width="561" class="line" id="line_7091"><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image22.jpg" title="" height="1554" width="998" class="line" id="line_7092"><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image14.jpg" title="" height="1637" width="1060" class="line" id="line_7093"><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image9.png" title="" height="781" width="555" class="line" id="line_7094"><a id="line_7095" class="line"></a><h2 class="text-center strong line" id="line_7096"><span>Side Story</span></h2><p class="text-center line" id="line_7097"><span>Rimuru’s Notebook</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Sierra Note: Anything in ‘~’ is part of the notebook" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span></p><hr class="line" id="line_7098"><img alt="" src="/ln/v6/images/image6.png" title="" height="448" width="314" class="line" id="line_7099"><p class="line" id="line_7100"><span>A certain location holds a small journal ——「Rimuru’s Notebook」, which was considered a valuable document with records of events regarding that period of time (refer to volume 5).</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7101"><span>But among experts, whether the artifact is authentic or forged has been a famous controversy even to this day.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7102"><span>But there is good reason for it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7103"><span>~Everyone was all happy about the fact that I have awoken by evolving into a demon lord.

It would seem he has come to deliver the message.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7136"><span>Since Kurobee has been spending most of his time alone in the workshop, I decided to invite him and later introduce him to the new-comers. But that seems to be unnecessary.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7137"><span>There are people who do care for Kurobee besides us.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7138"><span>I feel a sense of joy for that even though it was to be expected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7139"><span>So I decide to take the opportunity to chat with Kurobee a bit more.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7140"><span>「Thanks to Rimuru-sama’s evolution, I also gained some abilities. With these, I am planning to update everyone’s weapon. Since Rimuru-sama has now proclaimed to be a demon lord, there will probably be more armed conflicts in the future.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7141"><span>Kurobee smiles and says such words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7142"><span>Truly a reliable man.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7143"><span>It would seem Kurobee has gained Unique Skill 『Godly Craftsman』 on the basis of 『Researcher』.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7144"><span>That symbolizes Kurobee’s resolve, he will put his heart and soul into producing armaments.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7145"><span>「I’ve come to have him check on my sword.

So, in order to be better equipped to respond to all sorts of situations, I asked him to make more varieties of weapons」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7146"><span>Hakuro points to all sorts of bizarre weapons on the wall as he says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7147"><span>There are scythes that would be wielded by grim reaper[1] and two-handed great-swords; There are also more common weapons such as sword breakers[2], axes and spears.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7148"><span>As for weapons requiring more techniques to wield, there are poles, bladed knuckles and nunchakus.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7149"><span>There is even weapons as hard to wield as </span><span>kusarigamas</span><span>[3]</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7150"><span>It would seem he really has decided to pass on all his weapon techniques in order to cope with all situations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7151"><span>Speaking of which——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7152"><span>「I want to craft a kitchen knife for Shion, could you help to make it?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7153"><span>「Of course, Shion just wouldn’t let go of her odachi so it’s just about the right timing. While she holds onto a kitchen knife, I would be able to improve on her odachi.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7154"><span>「I’m relying on you. Also, you should also add on her blade——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7155"><span>I told my ideas to Kurobee, he also expresses interest in the modification.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7156"><span>As I was explaining, Hakuro passed me a glass of wine and somehow a drinking session started without me noticing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7157"><span>And because of that, I began to loosen up and give out all kinds of weapon proposals.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7158"><span>Most of them probably would turn out to be the results of fantasy and difficult to be of any practical use.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7159"><span>Even though I won’t get drunk, it still warrants myself to reflect the fact that I can lose myself in good atmosphere.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7160"><span>Benimaru was also participating in the weapon upgrade &nbsp;and handed his Tachi to Kurobee.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7161"><span>However, it’s an issue of whether Kurobee is gonna able to remember anything after getting sober. Oh well, that’s his problem.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7162"><span>We proceeded to the town square after leaving the workshop.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7163"><span>There, the people are working non-stop for the feast preparation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7164"><span>Among them, we encountered a party that’s gearing up to leave the town.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7165"><span>「Ah, Rimuru-sama! Congratulations on your evolution! I also feel like getting a bit stronger after that!」 </span></p><p class="line" id="line_7166"><span>「Oh, Gobuta. That would be pretty good. Speaking of which, there’s a feast tonight so where are you heading to now?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7167"><span>「Ahhh, I’ve been asked by Shuna-sama to visit the sea….」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7168"><span>「Aha?! The sea!?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7169"><span>Gobuta is heading to the seaside to collect fish for the feast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7170"><span>The last we visited the sea, the fish we brought back was made into sashimi. It would seem she asked Gobuta to help bring the top-tier goods, so they’ve decided to bring it back to the table.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7171"><span>「That’s not it, rather say I’m being requested to go——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7172"><span>「A second, Gobuta-san. If you continue this, it probably won’t end well.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7173"><span>「Y-Yes. That’s it, we’ll be back soon!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7174"><span>Gobuta stopped just before announcing whatever he was going to say after hearing his second-in-command’s reminder.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7175"><span>Mah, it is understood without saying.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7176"><span>Shuna’s request, rather to be called a request, it’s more of a forceful command.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7177"><span>Someone like Gobuta wouldn’t be able to resist that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7178"><span>「Ok, I’ll be looking forward to that. Catch something big to bring back!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7179"><span>&nbsp;「Understood. Leave the rest to us!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7180"><span>With that being said, Gobuta is pretty fond of fishing regardless.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7181"><span>I bear some regrets in not being able to prepare the feast with everyone. However, collecting the ingredients for the main course is an important task to hand to Gobuta.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7182"><span>He probably feels pretty happy in his heart despite the complaints.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7183"><span>As Gobuta prepared to leave, there came another person holding a bag dripping blood.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7184"><span>Due to the distinct swell of the bag, its dangling weight and smell make the us to feel dizzy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7185"><span>I turned to see who it was, and it turned out to be Gobuzo.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7186"><span>「So it’s Gobuzo. It’s great that you’re looking well but… What is that?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7187"><span>I asked subconsciously sensing an ominous aura emitting from the bag.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7188"><span>「Are? Isn’t this Gobuzo? What is this all about?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7189"><span>Before Gobuzo could answer, Gobuta and I both started to notice following my question….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7190"><span>Gobuzo’s answer was the testimony to my prediction, a truly horrifying foreshadowing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7191"><span>「Ah, Rimuru-sama! And Gobuta-san? I was told to bring Shion-sama her cooking ingredients.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7192"><span>Hold on a second.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7193"><span>Just, hold on for a while.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7194"><span>「Go-Gobuzo-kun? Whatever is inside that bloody bag, could——it——be the ingredients?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7195"><span>「Y-yeah Gobuzo. This-this is way too early to deliver right? Show us what’s inside the bag for a moment.」 &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7196"><span>Benimaru’s face is also gradually turning blue again, and demanded Gobuzo to open the bag.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7197"><span>What rolled from it was——a head of a Ushiroku[4].</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7198"><span>A mighty one at that, with a pair of strong horns.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7199"><span>But!! The problem here isn’t whether it’s a mighty beast or not.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7200"><span>「Hold on a sec! A Ushiroku’s head is completely inedible, right?!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7201"><span>I scream that out without knowing.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7202"><span>And Mr Ushiroku’s head, could you please stop looking at me with disappointment.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7203"><span>It must have been severed in an instant and transported here directly, so now its open eyes stare deep into mine.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7204"><span>That’s a bit horrifying when you think about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7205"><span>That’s a feeling I wouldn’t imagine feeling on day of a feast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7206"><span>This is probably what eating raw means, but even then, neh…</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7207"><span>「Is it really like that? Before, Shuna-sama said the same thing to Shion-sama, but it only seemed to ignited (ignite) her more…」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7208"><span>As Gobuzo said. I also recall having been warned by Shuna about this being inedible.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7209"><span>But because of that, Shion has been pretty competitive about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7210"><span>「(An)Ingredient that even Shuna-sama can’t handle——I shall make it work then!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7211"><span>The sudden invoked vain led her to order Gobuzo to bring the ingredient here.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7212"><span>「This is bad….

If I did that, Shion-sama would be mad at me.

Gobuzo may not look the part, but he is surprisingly bold.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7241"><span>It is normally a good thing, but not under this type of situation.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7242"><span>It can’t be helped: I guess I’ll have to intervene.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7243"><span>「Ah, how do I put this?

So I thought, and it really is pretty stupid-looking.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7272"><span>But even though it looks stupid, Gobuzo did in fact gain 『Pain Resistance』.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7273"><span>And it is also a fact that this led to many others to do the same thing</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7274"><span>That’s way too dangerous.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7275"><span>So I decided to add this method to my list of things he’s not allowed to say.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7276"><span>——As such, those who visited wanting to learn how Gobuzo gained pain nullification will never be able to find out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7277"><span>There are things better left undiscovered in this world.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7278"><span>After Gobuzo left, I was introduced to the three Beastketeers</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7279"><span>Benimaru summoned them here to greet me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7280"><span>I seem to have received more enthusiastic greets than before.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7281"><span>「Well, if Rimuru-sama can gather powerful majin such as Benimaru-sama and Shion-san, there’s no need to doubt the power of Rimuru-sama.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7282"><span>Alvis said so while Benimaru shows signs of fear as he is still thinking about Shion’s cooking.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7283"><span>Would her view change after seeing him in that state…?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7284"><span>Although I’m a bit intrigued but alas. Even I fear about Shion’s cooking, so I can’t mock Benimaru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7285"><span>I went to check on the beastmen’s temporary residence accompanied by Benimaru and the Beastketeers after that.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7286"><span>Those are the encouraged people setting up tents and distributing resources.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7287"><span>I also came to memorize the Beastmen’s faces for a better relationship in the future, living under the same roof.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7288"><span>The beastmen are building their tents at the designated refuge area underground.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7289"><span>All labor forces are working together under Geld’s command.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7290"><span>Due to the night feast, they’ve decided to finish laying out the bedsheets by the end day.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7291"><span>However, there seems to be a few people with new wounds all over…</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7292"><span>「These guys won’t listen to me, so I had to communicate with them with my fists.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7293"><span>In other words, they got beat up due to disobeying order, according to Geld.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7294"><span>Elephant Beastman and bear Beastman, such men who are bigger in size work as Geld’s hands and feet. Thanks to that, the operation seems to be proceeding faster than expected.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7295"><span>「It would definitely be faster if we &nbsp;did the job entirely on our own, but they (the beastmen) wouldn’t remember how to do it without us instructing.

Is there enough medicine?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7316"><span>「I-Isn’t this Rimuru-sama! No problem at all. Our production lately has also increased so there’s still plenty in stock.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7317"><span>「Is that so? Good work then! I’m relying on you in the future as well!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7318"><span>「YES SIR——! I’LL SERVE YOU WITH MY LIFE!!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7319"><span>Gabiru answered so, almost planning to kneel before me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7320"><span>It would seem he’s lost his smugness of late, perhaps it’s about time to give him a raise...</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7321"><span>「Next time, I’ll grant you a vacation. You should go visit your father and prepare a report on that. 」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7322"><span>「B-but…. I’ve been severed tie and chased out of home…」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7323"><span>「No need to worry, just visit with Souka under my name as a messenger.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7324"><span>「Oh, OH, </span><span>OH</span><span>…!! I like this, thank you so much. Please do entrust this duty to me!!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7325"><span>Gabiru accepted happily and went back to work.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7326"><span>The three Beastketeers &nbsp;stayed while having high hopes for the night feast. Our party then parted.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7327"><span>After the inspection, I returned to my room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7328"><span>On the way, I started chatting with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7329"><span>「I think it’s about to raise Gabiru to a higher office.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7330"><span>「Ah, I think that’s a good idea as well. He seems competent power-wise, and although that guy is still the same in terms of personality, there’s still a lot of hope in his future.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7331"><span>So it’s decided..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7332"><span>If necessary, I should also fix the severed tie between the Gabiru household.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7333"><span>「Hmm, as our officer, it would be bad for our image having a severed tie with a </span><span>monster</span><span>&nbsp;[5] clan chief. We better talk to Abiru and resolve the severed tie between the two.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7334"><span>「So it is for that reason. But it sure is concerning. If it is misunderstood that our country has bad blood with a internal officer, the Lizardman clan would probably be in an awkward spot.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7335"><span>Benimaru seemed to have caught up to me. It does help a lot that we are able to engage in the proper topic so fast.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7336"><span>Gabiru probably also wish to make peace with his father in his heart somehow. Besides, it really won’t be productive to continue this severed relationship.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7337"><span>As for the lizardman clan chief Abiru, if his kid was able to become an officer under a demon lord, it should be sufficient reason to reconnect with Gabiru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7338"><span>The problem here is that both Gabiru and Abiru are being stubborn.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7339"><span>If we don’t arrange Souka to mitigate prior to the event, they may end up in a fight.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7340"><span>It’s better to arrange things first and execute with sufficient preparations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7341"><span>So I should ask Souei to help.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7342"><span>Since he has already met Abiru, it would be alright to let him negotiate.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7343"><span>I left as I thought so with Benimaru.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7344"><span>(Hehehehe, WHAHAHA!

Thanks a lot then! I really don’t know and am not good at writing this, your words just save me!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7431"><span>I recall such conversation back then.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7432"><span>HOW-EVER!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7433"><span>This time——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7434"><span>「I’ve tried using page number, the afterword is around eight-page long!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7435"><span>「Eh? Eight pages, isn’t that too many?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7436"><span>I mean, afterword has reached eight pages, isn’t that a bit much.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7437"><span>So of course I would have concerns about it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7438"><span>「Oh well it can’t be helped. Due to binding issue with the book, if we are to cut down blank pages, the entire afterword would be lost.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7439"><span>「Ah, then I should just skip it——」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7440"><span>「No way, what do you mean by that? You have to write the afterword.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7441"><span>And we agreed during volume 1 that it’s not necessary, that kind and gentle Editor I-san is gone….</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7442"><span>No, I am quite fond of reading afterword of my novel I like, but whenever it is my turn to write, I am in the “it’s okay to skip it” faction.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7443"><span>The ability to think flexibly with accordance to different points of view is one of my special talent——but it can’t work now——I tried to use this talent to convince I-san, but…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7444"><span>「I’ll make you write it even if we need to increase pages! What “not writing afterword”, that’s not an option for you!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7445"><span>After getting a scolding from the editor, my road to not writing afterword is blocked.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7446"><span>I understand it won’t matter even if I struggle more, so after countless negotiations I get to cut down some of the pages.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7447"><span>Oh well, however.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7448"><span>It’s time for the cliche every time——</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7449"><span>「This time there may be a little more pages…...」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7450"><span>「Don’t worry, just don’t mind it and keep writing!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7451"><span>Even with that little interjection, they still wanted me to write the afterword.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7452"><span>I’ve always concerned about the increase of pages, and as it turns out the worries were unnecessary.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7453"><span>The pages of the actual story has increased a lot and now the pages for afterword needs to increase as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7454"><span>Editor I-san is truly crazy.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7455"><span>By the way, when I hand in my first draft, here are I-san’s thoughts:</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7456"><span>「XX scene seems to have been cut, what happened there?」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7457"><span>「No, it’s just that the pages involved are too many so I had to cut it out!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7458"><span>「No way you are serious about that?!

Just write it. You can write as much as《Slime》 if you want.」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7461"><span>This is a conversation we had.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7462"><span>In the end when I finished the first draft, the content has increased the most since I started with an addition of around ten thousand words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7463"><span>Due to the double line typesetting, it’s rumored to be the light novel with the most words from GC series. And even the page number has jumped to number one.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7464"><span>「Now we’ve made a new record!」</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7465"><span>Editor I-san says so.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7466"><span>How ambitious is his?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7467"><span>After all these trouble, volume six is finally out.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7468"><span>The volume has packed with most content in Tensura series, I hope everyone would have a fun time reading it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7469"><span>Now as followed I would like to do some discussion regarding the content of the volume.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7470"><span>As I’ve mentioned in volume 2, I always read afterord when I read a book.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7471"><span>That’s why there will be obvious spoiler, so you should prepare yourself before reading.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7472"><span>*** &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7473"><span>As I’ve mentioned in the afterword of volume 5, I’ve added a lot of content this time as well.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7474"><span>You can tell from the catalogue, Rimuru gets recognized in the volume and becomes a real Demon Lord. It’s written up to the birth of 「Eight Star Demon Lords」.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7475"><span>Based on the fourth arc「Birth of Demon Lord」from the Web version, I present the full story in volume 5 and volume 6.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7476"><span>Since the content from the web version of 「Birth of Demon Lord」is not enough for fill the whole of volume 5, you can imagine that most of the content was added afterward.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7477"><span>I’ve also interacted with Editor I-san and so the content is just like what I’ve mentioned in the afterword of volume 5.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7478"><span>I’ve worked hard on this in order to avoid being called that the effort in my work is all filler like Calpis</span><span class="icon color-primary color-in" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Calpis is a Japanese drink." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable"></span></span><span>&nbsp;diluted in water. </span></p><p class="line" id="line_7479"><span>That’s about it regarding this volume…..</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7480"><span>As usual, there are many characters present this time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7481"><span>It would probably be easier for web version reader to remember them, but the light novel reader may have a hard time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7482"><span>Now that I think about it more carefully, this light novel has twice as many words as most standard light novel, so it shouldn’t be that many characters being presented.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7483"><span>Everyone must want to see the illustrations, right——About that, I’ll rely on Mitz Vah sensei’s work!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7484"><span>Ten Great Demon Lords——Eh? Why are there eleven people? How strange——but the product is quite cool with everyone in the same room.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7485"><span>Speaking of which, Mitz Vah sensei apparently had got into a heated debate with Editor I-san regarding the breast size of female characters, I’ve not taken part into that part. As for whether the outcome of the debate is reflected, I’ll have everyone who read the end result of the illustration be the judge.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7486"><span>Oh oh, I’m getting off topic.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7487"><span>That’s how it is, now with beautiful illustrations the imagination with the characters become much easier.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7488"><span>And now to examine the difference from the web version, I can say perhaps only the outline is similar.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7489"><span>By the way, it is possible that certain character’s motive has completely changed with such tweaks in setting, and there are actually many changes if we are looking at details alone.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7490"><span>It’s quite hard to find original scene from the web version.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7491"><span>There will be more and more such small changes in the future that would amount to a completely different story.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7492"><span>But with that being said, I still intend to retain the outline of the web story. But I’ll only know the result after I write.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7493"><span>I hope everyone would continue to support me with the final product of《That time I got reincarnated by a slime》 by that time.</span></p><p class="text-center line" id="line_7494"><span>***</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7495"><span>And now it’s time for the summary of the afterword, I want to write some words of gratitude.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7496"><span>Thanks to Mitz Vah sensei who has been helping with the beautiful illustrations.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7497"><span>After reading the design draft of the characters, some of the character design even took the place of their original images in my heart.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7498"><span>What a great thing to embrace such thrill!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7499"><span>I would add more new characters in the future, I look forward to the feedback.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7500"><span>And also many thanks to Taiki Kawakami sensei who’s been in charge of the manga art as well as mange Editor U-san.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7501"><span>You guys——responded to my stubborn demands, I truly appreciate it.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7502"><span>And this time I also asked for your guys’ assistance and was responded with very straight-forward agreement.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7503"><span>Eh, do you want me to reduce the number of pages of afterword?</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7504"><span>What does that mean, I don’t understand.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7505"><span>My thanks also go out to Editor I-san who discusses with me all the time.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7506"><span>Your opinion is truly valuable to me.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7507"><span>Any work that not even the editor would approve is likely not possible to resonate with the readers either.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7508"><span>I hope you will also be as honest as you are now with your opinion!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7509"><span>My thanks go out to all the members who worked on proofreading, design as well as the production of the book.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7510"><span>Especially the fellow coworkers working on proofreading, it must be very hard proofreading so many words.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7511"><span>Thanks to everyone’s effort!</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7512"><span>And lastly my thanks go out to all the readers who bought the book, I’ll continue to work hard to allow everyone be able to enjoy 《That time I got reincarnated as a slime》 in the future.</span></p><p class="line" id="line_7513"><span>Well, see you all in the next volume!</span></p><hr class="c30 line" id="line_7514">
