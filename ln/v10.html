<h1 class="ch-name">Men on the Move</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_26"><em>Phew, seriously</em>—the young man sighed.</p>
<p id="line_27">“You seem frustrated. What’s the issue?” asked the man with the asymmetric mask. It was Laplace, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Moderate Clown Troupe" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_28">He was a trusted companion of this young man—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kagurazaka.</p>
<p id="line_29">“I suppose it’s <em>an issue</em>. Since I was invited, I went along to pay a visit. And as it turns out, our opponent is so incredibly strong that I’ve lost confidence in myself. I think it’s time to re-examine our plan.”</p>
<p id="line_30">“Did you say we need to re-examine our plan?” Ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kazalim" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, in disguise as a secretary—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—questioned back. To that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> responded with another sigh.</p>
<p id="line_31">“Yes. It’s about that slime. It turns out that it’s best that we avoid antagonizing him.”</p>
<p id="line_32">“If that’s the case, shouldn’t you just keep him close? I planned to explore the ruins as well, so isn’t it for the best that we maintain friendly terms anyway?”</p>
<p id="line_33">“No, we will still go according to our plan. It’s just going to be harder, that’s all.”</p>
<p id="line_34">“Why? Surely there won’t be any conflict if we tread carefully.”</p>
<p id="line_35">Laplace was no fool. Even though he bore a grudge after his companion Clayman was killed, he wasn’t going to go against his boss—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s commands—and pick a fight with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_36">It wasn’t just Laplace’s sentiment.</p>
<p id="line_37"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and even the chairman of the Clown Troupe, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, thought the same. Even they knew the danger of acting on impulse.</p>
<p id="line_38">The truth of this world was that it was the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p id="line_39">At this point, these experiences had taught Laplace and the others that if they didn’t have a one hundred percent chance of winning, forcing their plan would only result in failure.</p>
<p id="line_40">Far from wreaking vengeance on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon, Clayman was now dead. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kazalim" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> already put so much effort into resurrecting with the identity of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but now, it seemed like they were back at square one.</p>
<p id="line_41">Moreover, if they really were to take on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they would have no time to take their revenge on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Leon. It was for this reason that the clowns decided to obey <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s orders and be cautious.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_42">Yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> now claimed that there was a problem.</p>
<p id="line_43">“That’s true, but that also seems to have gotten harder.”</p>
<p id="line_44">“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p id="line_45">“I think that slime is onto me…”</p>
<p id="line_46">“What? Did you do something to get yourself caught?”</p>
<p id="line_47">“No way! This is the Boss we are talking here, not you, Laplace!”</p>
<p id="line_48">“Heh heh, that’s right, Laplace. As far as I can tell, there’s no one more careful than Boss. There’s no way that Boss would slip up.”</p>
<p id="line_49"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who had always been cautious, admitted his misstep. When Laplace retorted in surprise, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Teare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> reacted as if they denied it. That was how much <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had won the trust of the clowns.</p>
<p id="line_50"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, head of the Troupe, then scolded the clowns, “Don’t get riled up now. Rather than saying that it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s misstep, it was more due to that slime’s intricate mind games. I confronted it with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and found that that slime was really something else. I felt as though I was being surveilled from start to finish. It really got on my nerves. Although I’ve yet to see through its true ability yet, I could already tell that this was no easy opponent.”</p>
<p id="line_51">Having faced it herself, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew that slime was dangerous. Although she didn’t feel it was as strong as Leon, its eyes that seemingly could see through anything, made her feel greatly threatened.</p>
<p id="line_52"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, “Ahh, seriously, that slime—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—was really something else. During the festival, the key figures within the council that sponsored us, were there too. Those people didn’t know how to tackle the slime and ended up looking awfully pitiful. Our opponent was cunning and merciless. Despite his normally kind and generous demeanor, once he gets pissed off, he becomes a force to be reckoned with. Our plan of manipulating him didn’t work out. Surely, he will be on his guard from now on,” he shrugged.</p>
<p id="line_53">“But Boss, no matter how much he’s on the lookout, he doesn’t have any evidence, right? If that’s the case, as long as we act without raising any suspicion, won’t they struggle to make another move?”</p>
<p id="line_54">“That’s true, I didn’t leave any physical evidence, but I was the one who leaked the information about Shizu-san to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I think that should be sufficient evidence. In fact, on the last day, when he gathered everyone connected to him and discussed plans for the future, everyone gathered there seemed to be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s suspects. I was definitely found out there.”</p>
<p id="line_55">“How could that be…?”</p>
<p id="line_56">The gang went silent as they listened to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation.</p>
<p id="line_57">“Never mind. It’s only a matter of time, anyway. That slime really poses a threat to us. Then, Boss, how will we adjust the plan?”</p>
<p id="line_58"><em>Of course she’s the one to ask.</em> The first one to bounce back from the shock was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She had seen plenty of turmoil during her time as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so naturally, she was back on her feet just as fast.</p>
<p id="line_59">“Umm. Let’s first proceed just as before: keep ourselves in the shadows peacefully. Since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> doesn’t have concrete evidence, he won’t be openly hostile towards us. Despite his casual looks, he’s constantly calculating his losses and gains.”</p>
<p id="line_60">“I see. That’s why he mentioned the ancient ruins directly in front of us. He was probably trying to see our reaction. If we had planned something against him, he’d ruthlessly retaliate—”</p>
<p id="line_61">“My thoughts exactly. Humans are unpredictable creatures. There’s a saying that goes, ‘Today’s enemies could be tomorrow’s friends.’ Unless things change drastically, there’s no need for us to antagonize him. As long as we can change his mind to favor our side, we would be home free.”</p>
<p id="line_62"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> glanced around to observe everyone’s reaction.</p>
<p id="line_63">“In other words, we’re supposed to continue to cooperate with them?”</p>
<p id="line_64">“It shouldn’t be that difficult to control them by force, but since the Boss has spoken, we shall do as ordered.”</p>
<p id="line_65">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you big idiot, it’s because we <em>can’t</em> take them by force that we have been working so hard!”</p>
<p id="line_66">“Ahh, don’t get so worked up about it. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Footman" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has a point too. It’d piss anyone off to have been looked down upon by some newcomer. But even if we win by working together, they still have the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Storm Dragon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. There’s no need to gamble our own forces for that.”</p>
<p id="line_67">“Yeah. We shouldn’t dwell on it too much. Just follow Boss and Chairman’s orders.”</p>
<p id="line_68">“You guys, I told you all to follow orders from the start! I don’t object to their views at all.”</p>
<p id="line_69">The trio looked a bit upset, but they weren’t objecting to the plan. Having confirmed so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> exchanged looks and nodded.</p>

<p id="line_187">After all, I had no intention of letting the children return to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the first place.

<p id="line_188">I didn’t forget to register their transfer.

After “Merging” them with spirits, they had obtained incredible power. Any average tutor wouldn’t have been able to handle them.

I had mentioned spirits by accident back then during our conversation. And according to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reaction at the time, he seemed to have known about it from the start.</p>
<p id="line_190"><em>I should probably have kept it a secret</em>—</p>
<p id="line_191">«Report. You should have kept it a secret indeed.»</p>
<p id="line_192"><em>R-right.</em> Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san seemed to be rubbing the salt in the wound.</p>
<p id="line_193">No no no, even if I hadn’t said anything, he probably would have found out anyway.</p>
<p id="line_194"><em>We’re just overthinking it, so let’s not worry about it too much.</em></p>
<p id="line_195">«…»</p>
<p id="line_196"><em>Umm, sorry.</em></p>
<p id="line_197">I still spilled the beans despite my suspicions towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I realized that in some corner of my heart, I still wanted to believe in him. I’ll have to reflect on this slip-up and be more cautious in the future.</p>
<p id="line_198">The children were now my responsibility. And given these circumstances, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s help was a godsend.

<p id="line_200">After I settled on the idea, I stood alongside the kids behind the row of desks. Yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> glared at me.</p>
<p id="line_201">“What are you trying to do here?”</p>
<p id="line_202">“Eh, well, I wanted to observe for a bit…”</p>
<p id="line_203">“You’re a nuisance, so get out now.”</p>
<p id="line_204">“Ah, yes ma’am…”</p>
<p id="line_205">And so I was chased out cruelly. What a pity.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_206">This was what happened around a week after the end of the festival. The traffic on the streets had gradually settled down and the residents were no longer that busy. And so, we began to open and run the moderated dungeon. Quite a few adventurers seemed eager to explore the dungeon and a great number of them had inquired about it. And, as if in response to their expectations, we finally opened up the labyrinth. We had already made sufficient preparations and waited until just the right moment to open.</p>
<p id="line_207">The days gradually became busy.</p>
<p id="line_208">………</p>
<p id="line_209">……</p>
<p id="line_210">…</p>
<p id="line_211">Problems emerged within hours of the debut. The issue at hand was the unexpectedly reckless and stupid way challengers went about exploring the dungeon.</p>
<p id="line_212">We expected this to happen for the first demonstration during the opening festival. That’s why we took steps to lower the difficulty accordingly. But despite all that, the challengers were still having too much of a hard time. It would appear that what we set up was just not gonna work.</p>
<p id="line_213">We didn’t put any traps on the first floor, and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that spawned there were at most F-ranked mobs. Being incapable of combat, these were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> even a villager could easily handle.</p>
<p id="line_214">The intent behind the design of this floor was to provide challengers with a sense of pride and accomplishment and familiarize everyone with the environment inside, which was why we only placed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the rooms that contained treasure chests. That said, the previous fall traps that Ramiris set were all removed. So, in order to successfully break through the floor, you would still need to sketch maps.</p>
<p id="line_215">The way I saw it, no matter how slow you were, a whole day was the longest you would need to complete the floor.</p>
<p id="line_216">Yet for the past three days, not a single one managed to get to the second floor. Even that squad Basson led got lost big time and just gave up. Even though Basson’s squad already had experience with the labyrinth, they still didn’t plan out any noteworthy strategy.</p>
<p id="line_217"><em>Should I say that I’m dumbfounded or what…</em></p>
<p id="line_218">But I guess you could say Basson’s squad was doing well, especially considering that some teams even fell victim to rank D <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_219"><em>Perhaps I should correct myself:</em> that happened to <em>a lot</em> of teams.</p>
<p id="line_220">Most of them were likely blinded by greed and didn’t discover the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lurking in the room’s corners. Plenty of idiots like that went straight for the treasure chest instead. They were probably caught by surprise by mere skeleton archers. As these comically bad adventurers rushed towards the treasure chests, their backs were inevitably pierced with arrows.</p>
<p id="line_221">In other words, they just sucked. Their danger awareness was practically nonexistent. Among the idiots, some were at least smart enough to come in squads. Yet there were really no limits on human stupidity, since some of them actually tried to challenge our labyrinth on their own. That kind of behavior bordered on insanity.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_222">As I’ve mentioned, the spawn rate of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on the first floor was really low, and even if any were to spawn at all, they were rank F at best. That said, when appearing in a group, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like those could still pose a threat. Actually, whether it indeed “posed a threat” was subject to debate. Rather, I should say that it posed sufficient threat to the challengers.</p>
<p id="line_223">If you were to come in alone, even resting would prove challenging. With no one on guard, you couldn’t even take a nap. No matter how weak rank F <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were, they were still capable of hurting you. Certain types of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would launch a sneak attack on sleeping humans, and if you weren’t cautious enough, you could easily wind up dead.</p>
<p id="line_224">I initially thought that these solo challengers had some great strategies in mind, but it turned out that they were just a bunch of brainlets. These reckless idiots didn’t get anywhere and immediately left upon exiting the labyrinth. But, to be honest, based on how they had acted, they wouldn’t have lasted any longer even if they had managed to somehow make it further down.</p>
<p id="line_225">From Floor 2 onward, not only were there more <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the hallways, but rank E opponents would also start spawning among them. When challengers made it to Floor 5, they would begin to face rank D <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well. If you had trouble merely getting through these earlier floors, you would definitely be killed when encountering rank D <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_226">One of the challengers had a particularly embarrassing reason for forfeiting—he was starving.</p>
<p id="line_227">On every tenth floor we had set a save point, and on every fifth floor we had a safe zone prepared where water could be refilled. We also subtly reminded everyone to bring more rations.</p>
<p id="line_228">The other adventurers seemed to have made plans after analyzing Basson’s squad’s experience. But that alone wasn’t enough. Adventurers seemed to be a very prideful bunch and they often ignored others’ advice. Not sure whether it was the fact that they couldn’t die in the labyrinth, or that they were overconfident in their abilities. Either way, many of them didn’t bring any rations.</p>
<p id="line_229">If you got so lost that you were unable to find your way back to the entrance, then starvation came as no surprise.</p>
<p id="line_230">No matter how I thought about it, it was their own fault.</p>
<p id="line_231">They wanted to open as many treasure chests as possible—<em>although I suppose I remember how that feels…</em></p>
<p id="line_232">If our labyrinth were truly designed with the intention to kill, I doubt there’d be anyone who could crack it even after a hundred years. But at this time, the challengers were either impoverished bodyguards or mercenaries, all of whom sucked at exploration.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_233"><em>We don’t have to panic just yet</em>—with that thought, I held my expectations for the next three days.</p>
<p id="line_234">Yet, in the end, not a single one managed to reach the safe zone on the fifth floor. The attempts had been miserable.</p>
<p id="line_235">………</p>
<p id="line_236">……</p>
<p id="line_237">…</p>
<p id="line_238">That being said, we did profit off of the entry fees, which was always a plus. But if this were to continue, the adventurers would all have low morale, and chances of challengers returning would be minimal.</p>
<p id="line_239">It looked like we needed to re-examine the whole project.</p>
<p id="line_240">This unexpected matter had caused me grave concern.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_241">This being the case, I called an emergency meeting.</p>
<p id="line_242">The people attending were me, Veldora, Ramiris, and the observer, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I also summoned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who ran the project. After confirming everyone’s arrival, I lead the opening statement: “Everyone, it has been three days since the labyrinth went public, but this is not looking good. To be blunt, it actually sucks. For our entertainment—no, in order to have anyone want to return to our labyrinth—I think it would be best to provide them with a level of guidance.”</p>
<p id="line_243">First of all, people would have problems reaching the tenth floor if we were to continue like this. If that were to be the case, our labyrinth would probably have to be put on hold as a result. That’s why I came to the conclusion that we had to at least educate them about strategy to some degree.</p>
<p id="line_244">“Umm! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is right. If we allow this to continue, there won’t be a chance for me to shine no matter how much longer I wait.”</p>
<p id="line_245">“Seriously! Floors 50 and below are my proud work. I really want the world to see them. I think we can give them some hints!”</p>
<p id="line_246">And so, I got Veldora and Ramiris’s approval. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to be pondering something—actually, he seemed confused. He didn’t know why he was here and seemed to feel out of place. After all, he got summoned so abruptly. Anyhow, it looked like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> probably needed a while to regain his cool, after which I would ask for his opinion.</p>
<p id="line_247">I shifted my gaze away from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and over to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Getting to see <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who he admired greatly, had left him beaming with joy. It was probably the reason why he was particularly well-prepared to speak on the matter.</p>
<p id="line_248">“May I have a word about it?”</p>
<p id="line_249">“Any suggestion is welcome. Speak your mind; there’s no need to hold back.”</p>
<p id="line_250">Hearing this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded.</p>
<p id="line_251">“Regarding the matter of giving hints, I hope you can be reserved about the number. It’s only been three days and whatever adventurers we had so far, each one of them had subpar skill. I have already made contact with some seasoned adventurers through the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; therefore, I believe that there, surely, will be more adventurers of rank C or higher with greater abilities in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_252">“Is it going to work?”</p>
<p id="line_253">“Yes. Although I can’t grasp what’s on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s mind, he did carry out his end of our deal. He contacted all the divisions of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> throughout the land via ‘Magic Communication’ in order to promote us.”</p>
<p id="line_254">“I see, so there’s some benefit to hosting one of their branches here after all. Anything else?”</p>
<p id="line_255">“Yes. I’ve asked for favors from the merchants to assist in advertising. The experienced bodyguards and street mobs that were acquainted with them also joined the cause. Their report seemed to indicate very good feedback from the public.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_256">Both the delivery and collection of information were important.</p>
<p id="line_257">I then introduced <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and told her to assist him in his work.</p>

It seemed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was good at dealing with people, and so the two immediately got along. I was glad that there was no prejudice involved.</p>
<p id="line_259">And with that, several of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates began operating under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s command.</p>
<p id="line_260">As a matter of fact, even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> helped him out with things. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was currently investigating Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s activity.

<p class="space-break" id="line_262">“In other words, we will wait for elites to gather from all across the land, and then make a decision?”</p>
<p id="line_263">“Indeed.

I believe that we should calm down now and set our eyes on the future! Moreover, if the noblemen invest in the conquest, we can expect to see adventurers with rank B and above.”</p>
<p id="line_264">Seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodding in admiration, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to be pleased. Looks like he was eager to show off his abilities in front of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_265">What he said made sense as well. It was all because of how much Veldora and Ramiris complained that I too got nervous all of a sudden.</p>
<p id="line_266">Basson’s entire squad combined could be considered as rank B. With their current equipment, their individual abilities were around C to C-plus, far from outstanding. If the conquest were handled by someone above rank B, surely, they would familiarize themselves with the labyrinth without requiring many hints.</p>
<p id="line_267">In our labyrinth, you could pay to have your personal safety ensured. Even if we left them to their own devices, these experienced adventurers would be able to devise their own strategies.</p>
<p id="line_268">“That’s right; there’s no use for us to rush things.”</p>
<p id="line_269">Public interest in the labyrinth was high. Apart from ‘Magic Crystals,’ you could also harvest materials from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and knowing that you could sell these for a pretty penny, there was no end to the number of people who came flocking to the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_270">The nobles were also quick to react. Their willingness to partake in the conquest business was higher than we imagined. Some were quick-witted enough to immediately hire adventurers upon returning to their nation, requesting them to help with the labyrinth conquest. These hired adventurers weren’t driven into rash actions by their own desires. They would only operate after proper preparations and setting up plans. Right now, there weren’t as many of these types of adventurers, but I expected to see a rise in number in the future.</p>
<p id="line_271">“Then what should we do?”</p>
<p id="line_272">“We’ve set up an armory on the first floor, should we have the challengers try things out over there?”</p>
<p id="line_273">“Try out? What can they try there?”</p>
<p id="line_274">Ramiris wasn’t the only one who was confused, so I began to explain my idea: “I was thinking about setting up a training ground for people to practice. They can study how to counter traps and how to fight against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Wouldn’t that be more meaningful compared to giving them hints?”</p>
<p id="line_275">We could also build a stadium of sorts along with it. Due to the increasing number of novice recruits to our nation’s army, I hoped that this would be beneficial to their training. There wouldn’t be any fatal accidents in the labyrinth, so maybe this would provide some very meaningful combat experience.</p>
<p id="line_276">An unexpected ally came forth to support my idea—it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_277">“If that were to be the case,” he interjected rather casually, “I think it would also be nice to hold lectures about the dungeon conquest.”</p>
<p id="line_278">I looked at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in surprise.</p>
<p id="line_279">“Ah, was it bad for me to cut in like that?”</p>
<p id="line_280">“No no, there’s no such thing!”</p>
<p id="line_281">“Ayy, that’s good. The topic you guys were discussing sounded quite interesting. Even I could follow along, so I accidentally cut in,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said with a wry smile.</p>
<p id="line_282">He was adapting faster than I imagined, but he did seem kind of bold.</p>
<p id="line_283">“Then what sort of lecture should we hold?”</p>
<p id="line_284"><em>Should we have all the adventurers gather at the big conference room if we were to hold lectures?</em></p>
<p id="line_285">It would be very helpful to explain how the labyrinth worked to them.</p>
<p id="line_286">“We can imitate tutorials in video games.”</p>
<p id="line_287">“<em>Tu…torials</em>? What is that?”</p>
<p id="line_288">“That sounds tasty, is it food?”</p>
<p id="line_289"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s suggestion got Veldora and Ramiris’s attention.</p>
<p id="line_290">And I thought that Veldora would know, but it seemed he actually had no idea about it?</p>
<p id="line_291">The language in this world could be translated pretty accurately, but when lacking a shared understanding of a subject, it would be hard for two parties to make sense of what the other was saying. Since Veldora had no idea what a tutorial was, Ramiris couldn’t have known either.</p>
<p id="line_292">And so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I began to explain what tutorials were.</p>
<p id="line_293">“It’s like a facility to train their abilities. We can simulate what actually takes place in the labyrinth.”</p>
<p id="line_294">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san is right. I think it is important to experience all possible scenarios before entering the labyrinth. If we can teach everyone the basics in the form of missions, I’m sure that it will be easier even for the adventurers to understand—”</p>
<p id="line_295">Adventurers probably aren’t gonna be fans of lengthy explanations. So, we could only prepare a training ground for people who were serious enough to experience for themselves—this was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s suggestion.</p>
<p id="line_296">Therefore, we planned to make it a mission-style tutorial. Before releasing the permits to enter, they would have to undertake some simple missions. In this way, the adventurers hoping to challenge the labyrinth would learn the bare minimum required for exploration.</p>
<p id="line_297">Veldora and Ramiris seemed to have understood after hearing our explanations.</p>
<p id="line_298">“That may be great. From my point of view, everything now is too simple to the point of being boring. I hope that you can build a training ground so that these challengers can improve their skills.”</p>
<p id="line_299">“I think so too! If Milim were to catch a glimpse of those past challengers, she would have lashed out and beaten all of them up.”</p>
<p id="line_300">Veldora, Ramiris and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> all gave the green light.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_301">“After studying the tutorial, we should let them try out some of the amazing weapons and armors crafted in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. For those who struggled during their actual expedition, preparing more challenging tutorial missions sounded like it would be a fun idea as well,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave some rather note-worthy suggestions.</p>
<p id="line_302">I see, issuing a guidebook could be an interesting idea. It could also serve as a little tourism brochure. We could introduce the town to the new-comers and even find some suitable people to write some columns.</p>
<p id="line_303">A lot of inefficiencies stemmed from the fact that no one really knew much about the labyrinth. For that reason, we decided to at least give them a basic tutorial. If we didn’t, I doubt anyone would be able to make it past Floor 50, where the difficulty really ramped up. And for those who wanted to fully experience the labyrinth, it would be good to prepare a more extensive practice course.</p>
<p id="line_304">Well, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s were scheduled to be dispatched for Floor 50 and below, which you could say was the real deal.</p>
<p id="line_305">It seemed like we couldn’t expect a lot from the adventurers for now, so it looked like we’d have to depend on the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to be Ramiris and Veldora’s playmates.</p>
<p id="line_306">With that, we decided to open the first floor as a practice field. We also didn’t forget to prepare an entrance for the new recruits, separate from the challengers.</p>
<p id="line_307">“You’re right; it would be good to separate them. Okay, I’ll make them right away!” Ramiris accepted it willingly.</p>
<p id="line_308">With everything settled like that, I was about to end the meeting when…</p>
<p id="line_309">“Ah, wait a moment. Another idea came to mind.”</p>
<p id="line_310">To my surprise, it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> himself who gave his opinion with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p id="line_311">“Right now, we only have inns and restaurants in safe zones, don’t we? Don’t you think it would be a good idea to prepare them on every floor as well? And you see, not having places like restrooms too can be tough. If we’re connecting the spaces anyway, we should set up doors near the stairs of each floor. Since there are people who set out for battle without even a sleeping bag, don’t you think it would be nice to provide them with a sleeping space for a premium price?”</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/illustrations/image1.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_312"></p>
<p id="line_313"><em>What? This guy…could he be some sort of a genius?!</em></p>
<p id="line_314"><em>Hmm, a restroom, huh. Maybe it’s because I no longer have bodily functions. I completely forgot to consider that.</em></p>
<p id="line_315">I was quite surprised by his insight.</p>
<p id="line_316">I turned to Ramiris. She signaled her agreement with a vigorous nod.</p>
<p id="line_317">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun, we will employ that idea right away!”</p>
<p id="line_318">“As expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Your insights are brilliant!”</p>
<p id="line_319">“Yeah yeah! I’ll remove the safe zones and put up doors by the stairs connecting to the rest area instead!”</p>
<p id="line_320">Doing this was comparable to offering toilet paper at an exorbitant price next to restrooms that, <em>incidentally</em>, didn’t have any.</p>
<p id="line_321">It was a dirty, but nonetheless effective tactic.</p>
<p id="line_322">It seemed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was actually quite sharp.</p>
<p id="line_323">“If you have any other ideas, please don’t be shy. Feel free to speak up,” I urged him with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_324">Then, as if he were remembering the games he played, he immersed himself deep in thought.</p>
<p id="line_325">“Ummm, let me see… Is it possible to make single-use save points? I was lucky enough to get to the tenth floor, but now without the pitfalls I think it would take quite a bit of time. For the challengers, this isn’t just a game, and I think the total amount of time they need to spend is one of the things that makes the labyrinth especially hard.”</p>
<p id="line_326"><em>Hmm, I see. Surely, what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said has some truth.</em></p>
<p id="line_327">With the way the labyrinth was currently set up, it would take challengers several days just to get to the tenth floor. Hearing the idea just now, I realized that all the time spent in the labyrinth created a wealth of business opportunities. How about we go one step further and give this more thought?</p>
<p id="line_328">“Mmm, what that boy there is saying is right! Humans are fragile, so we have to give this more consideration.”</p>
<p id="line_329">Veldora was the first to approve <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s suggestion.</p>
<p id="line_330">And just <em>who</em> was the one that gleefully made this labyrinth of horrors targeted towards “fragile” humans?</p>
<p id="line_331">“If they’re disposable save points, then I can prepare them with my power, y’know? But wouldn’t it be more profitable to make an inn for them to stay at?”</p>
<p id="line_332">The single use savepoints could, in fact, be made. And Ramiris, for some reason, was surprisingly sharp whenever money was involved.</p>
<p id="line_333">“Not at all, Ramiris-sama. Rather, this is precisely why we should charge a high price for it. Adventurers that don’t have any pressing matters will choose to stay at an inn. However, there are probably people who are required to report back regularly. There are also people who would prefer to have at least one just in case anything unexpected happens while they’re in the labyrinth. With that in mind, our sales will surely increase along with the ‘Return Whistle.”’</p>
<p id="line_334">Seemed like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> saw an opportunity for success and wanted to exploit it. Hearing that, I definitely <em>could</em> think of various use cases.</p>
<p id="line_335">If you ended up spending several days in the labyrinth, there could be times where you would want to know the situation outside. Adventurers employed by nobles were in on the action as well, so they might be obligated to report back every now and then.</p>
<p id="line_336">Moreover—</p>
<p id="line_337">“Aren’t there strong <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> guarding the save point on the tenth floor? While in our case my party was easily able to defeat them, I think there would be quite a lot of people who would want to use the save point <em>before</em> challenging those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_338">After hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> out, I very much agreed with him. Saving before challenging a guardian—that’s what every gamer would come to expect.</p>
<p id="line_339">Memories of challenging the final boss without saving beforehand, dying, and then having hours of work go up in smoke all came flooding back to my mind. Those sad incidents could be forgotten with a laugh because it was just a game. But I wonder how furious people would be if it were in real life.</p>
<p id="line_340">“I see. Thinking about it, maybe our difficulty curve was a bit too harsh.”</p>
<p id="line_341">Veldora and Ramiris nodded along as well.</p>
<p id="line_342">“My boy, no, did you say your name was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? I think your views will be very helpful moving forward.”</p>
<p id="line_343">“Yup, Yup. Incredible, incredible. As expected of an ‘Otherworlder’ like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I hope you’ll keep pitching in, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_344">And in no time, they seemed to have accepted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as a colleague.</p>
<p id="line_345">And <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as well.</p>
<p id="line_346">“Below the fiftieth floor, where the going gets tough, I think it would be all right to remove those conveniences. But at least for the upper floors, where there are few skilled adventurers, it wouldn’t hurt to hold their hands a little.”</p>
<p id="line_347">He was firing off suggestions on operations management left and right. I wondered if this high adaptability was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s true character. Well, I didn’t have any objections either.</p>
<p id="line_348">“Okay, then should we prepare a resting room beside each stairwell? And if they pay, let’s make it so they could go to an area on the ninety-fifth floor.”</p>
<p id="line_349">“Are you saying we’ll prepare an inn and a restaurant there?”</p>
<p id="line_350">“Of course. I don’t plan on opening the exclusive elven shops (cabaret) for adventurers. We’ll provide separate accommodations for those guys. Naturally, it’ll be pricier!”</p>
<p id="line_351">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I understand.”</p>
<p id="line_352">Tourist spots were pricier. If you went to places like the summit of Mount Fuji, something as simple as a coffee could be many times more expensive. The barbequed beef there was unparalleled, but regardless of the taste, it was quite pricey. In the same vein, it was only natural that using the facilities within the labyrinth would be more expensive than using the facilities outside.</p>
<p id="line_353">With this, the city on the ninety-fifth floor just got a lil’ more useful.</p>
<p id="line_354">“And Ramiris, about the one-use save points, could you really prepare them?”</p>
<p id="line_355">“Of course! It’s trivial for me! You see, there is an orb called the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Recording Crystal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and it can be used to make one-use save points.”</p>
<p id="line_356">Ramiris had gone and made something rather handy. It would work anywhere in the labyrinth, but, other than that, it was like a normal save point. If you registered with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Recording Crystal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and died, it would be possible to return to the recorded spot.</p>
<p id="line_357">In case you got out of the labyrinth with a ‘Return Whistle,’ your return point would be the point that was saved in the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Recording Crystal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This applied even if the structure of the labyrinth changed. It wouldn’t be the exact same spot, but it’d at least take you to the nearest safe zone.</p>
<p id="line_358">“Let’s sell it at the store for a high price.”</p>
<p id="line_359">“Speaking of which, I think it would be good to hand out a few for promotional use.”</p>
<p id="line_360">“Then I will include them in the treasure chests as a rare drop!”</p>
<p id="line_361">And with that, everything was smooth sailing.</p>
<p id="line_362">“GA-HAHAHA, finally some more fun!”</p>
<p id="line_363">“Although I think it’s a bit too early to say, we should be seeing less people give up as a result of these changes.”</p>
<p id="line_364">Veldora and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were happily taking part in the conversation as well.</p>
<p id="line_365">And just like this, by tackling the problems together one by one, progress was made, and improvements were proposed.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_366">Great, great. Everyone’s insight has been helpful.</p>
<p id="line_367">The first floor was converted into a tutorial-style training ground, which also included an announcement system. We set it up to have missions so that adventurers wouldn’t be totally clueless coming in.</p>
<p id="line_368">Whether they made use of it or not was up to them. Nothing good came out of forcing stuff upon them. Plus, whatever happened would be their own responsibility.</p>
<p id="line_369">Additionally, we also made it so that you couldn’t die on the first floor. There could be adventurers that caused problems, and it would be troublesome if something happened to the employees in charge.</p>
<p id="line_370">Not only that, I also wanted to use the first floor for people to experiment with dying. We set it to resurrect immediately on the spot so it could also be suitable for a children’s playground.</p>
<p id="line_371">We also prepared a room for more experienced adventurers to practice fighting against different kinds of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We captured some <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and gave them a collar that allowed them to constantly revive. The adventurers could sharpen their skills here.</p>
<p id="line_372">Using the extra space, we also made an area dedicated to training our own recruits. From time to time, it would be fun to catch a large number of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for large scale collective battles.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_373">The real dungeon started from the second floor downward.</p>
<p id="line_374">However, we wouldn’t be deploying any lethal traps until the fourth floor. There would only be rank E to F lesser <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> roaming the area. The rooms would only have one rank D <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The treasure chests in them would contain items such as low healing potions which would be helpful for early labyrinth exploration. High price items such as gear were set to spawn only on the fifth floor and below.</p>
<p id="line_375">And that pretty much summed up all the adjustments we made to the difficulty.</p>
<p id="line_376"><em>With this, the challengers can pick up the pace of their conquest of the dungeon starting tomorrow.</em></p>
<p id="line_377">Everything up until now was like a closed beta for a developing game, so it was no surprise that we weren’t ready to open the real thing right away.</p>
<p id="line_378">…Well, in truth, we already had beta testers.</p>
<p id="line_379">But our testers were six of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yomigaeri" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ which might not have painted an accurate picture. Those guys swept through the first thirty-nine floors without a hitch. Unfortunately, they got annihilated by the fortieth floor’s boss, the tempest serpent. Thanks to that, we got the false impression that the difficulty of the labyrinth was just right.</p>
<p id="line_380">They didn’t fall victim to the traps, nor did they struggle against the small fry <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I didn’t think there would be any problems with the labyrinth difficulty after seeing their performance. Maybe they could even reach the fiftieth floor with a little bit more experience.</p>
<p id="line_381"><em>Seems like I needed to be more careful when choosing testers.</em></p>
<p id="line_382"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> trained them herself and they’d become more exceptional than we could have expected.</p>
<p id="line_383"><em>Welp, we can think about all that stuff later.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_384">“Then, shall we wrap it up here? Are there no other comments or concerns?”</p>
<p id="line_385">Even if I was fully satisfied, I still had to make sure everyone else was fine with it, too. A lot of suggestions had already been made, so I thought that was gonna be all for today. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suddenly interjected, “Could I say one more thing?”</p>
<p id="line_386">“Eh? Is there something else?”</p>
<p id="line_387">“There is. It’s about the management of the labyrinth.”</p>
<p id="line_388"><em>Ahh, is this about the labyrinth’s advertisement and fee collection?</em></p>
<p id="line_389">I definitely was concerned about that part as well. It had only been three days, so the profits probably weren’t that noticeable, but…</p>
<p id="line_390">It seemed like Ramiris also smelled the money. She stared right at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with an avaricious glint in her eyes. She was such a vulgar fairy that it made me laugh.</p>
<p id="line_391">“Haha, even if you look at me like that, the fund collection has only just started. The report I will give is related to the advertisement.”</p>
<p id="line_392"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smiled bitterly as if he were giving an excuse to Ramiris. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> then hardened his expression and began the explanation.</p>
<p id="line_393">“I’ve already come up with an idea of monetary reward to attract the attention of the nobles. How about one hundred gold coins?”</p>
<p id="line_394"><em>Ho ho?</em></p>
<p id="line_395">“That would only be natural—”</p>
<p id="line_396">“Of course,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> interjected, “the payment will instead be in the form of one <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="stellar gold coin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. At least, that’s my plan.”</p>
<p id="line_397"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had already read my intentions and was planning accordingly.</p>
<p id="line_398">I learned one thing from my mistake before. He thought of converting the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="stellar" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to just regular gold coins for the sake of liquidity. As far as I knew, even just one hundred gold coins should be nearly ten million Japanese yen.</p>
<p id="line_399">“But isn’t that too low?”</p>
<p id="line_400">It might’ve been a lot of money for an average joe, but it was hardly enough to convince a noble. Of course, the labyrinth had more to offer than one hundred gold coins. Rare drops from treasure chests, magic crystal, etc. but I didn’t think we should be relying on those alone.</p>
<p id="line_401"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> answered my doubts with a reassuring smile.</p>
<p id="line_402">“Huhuhu, those doubts are natural. I will advertise that this reward will go to those who beat the fiftieth floor. Only the first set of teams every month can claim this prize. If it’s just one person, then he or she will get everything. If they have a party, then the reward will be split. However, there’s more to it—”</p>
<p id="line_403">According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation, each boss <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would drop a reward when subjugated. The tenth floor’s guardian was a rank B black spider. If you subjugated this one, then the first five teams would get a reward of three gold coins.</p>
<p id="line_404">On the twentieth floor was the rank B-plus evil centipede. It was a fairly strong <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that could spew a long-range and potent ‘paralyzing breath.’ If you subjugated this, the first five teams would get a reward of five gold coins.</p>
<p id="line_405">We placed a rank B-plus ogre lord and his five subordinates on the thirtieth floor. They differed from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his clan in the sense that they were brutal <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that acted only on instinct. They possessed tremendous strength and were capable of coordination. Since you would be battling against a group of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, fighting them would be difficult without a team. The reward for beating them was ten gold coins. The same first five team policy applied as well.</p>
<p id="line_406">And from here on out it genuinely became difficult.</p>
<p id="line_407">The fortieth floor had the tempest serpent which was rank A-minus. This guy had a lethal ranged attack called ‘Poison Breath’ that was capable of instantly annihilating naive parties. Seriously, beating this guy would prove no easy feat, even for an A ranked adventurer like Gai. The reward was twenty gold coins. Only the first three teams could claim it, but only very few people would be able to beat it and survive.</p>
<p id="line_408">The job as the fiftieth floor’s boss was scheduled to be handled by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mezer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on a rotating basis. They had evolved beyond rank A, so those who could take them down were quite limited. If you broke through the fiftieth floor, then you would receive one hundred gold coins. It was a much more substantial award, but that’s to be expected if you looked at the difficulty.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_409">“I see. Seems like a fair distribution. If we advertised it like this, would we be able to spark the competitive spirits of the nobles?”</p>
<p id="line_410">“It’s exactly like that. We can fuel their competitive drive even further by announcing the subjugators each month. Since the reward is only limited for the first time, the same person can’t receive the reward multiple times. This can avoid causing excessive competition.”</p>
<p id="line_411"><em>I see.</em> If they could only claim it once, there wouldn’t be a point in obsessing over fighting the bosses of the prizes. We could also prevent the same people from monopolizing the monthly rewards.</p>
<p id="line_412">Since the amount of people that could receive the reward were limited each month, we could calculate it as a fixed business expense.</p>
<p id="line_413">“Then, can we adjust the profit margins?”</p>
<p id="line_414">“No problem. I’ve calculated based on the sales of our first three days of running the labyrinth, we may even raise the prize money a bit.”</p>
<p id="line_415">The prize money would only be a small part of our actual profit. We were merely trying to incite the participants’ competitiveness and their willingness to try their luck.</p>
<p id="line_416">Our balance wouldn’t be at a loss anyways, so this was a great strategy. Someone breaking through the fiftieth floor seemed like a distant future for the time being. With that in mind, the money we would have to distribute was rather trivial.</p>
<p id="line_417">“If push comes to shove, we could ask <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama to break through the fiftieth floor and to promote the labyrinth but…”</p>

<p id="line_421">He seemed to have made a plausible plan, so let’s go with that.</p>
<p id="line_422">“It’s a plan. We could spread <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s fame and also advertise the dungeon at the same time. We should look out for a time when the mainstream meta becomes stagnant and begin that operation then.”</p>
<p id="line_423">“I was thinking that as well. As expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Kufufu.”</p>
<p id="line_424">“It’s nothing really, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Mmfufuf.”</p>
<p id="line_425">I laughed with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as I was satisfied.</p>
<p id="line_426">“Excuse me, what about my opinion…”</p>

Rather, we were only just getting to the meat of things.</p>
<p id="line_429">“So, I want to propose something to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama: I wish to make the reward even bigger!” he said, giving off a wicked grin.</p>
<p id="line_430">At that moment, I felt like he was such a reliable person.</p>
<p id="line_431">“Tell me about it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” I responded with a Buddha smile that showed my open-mindedness.</p>
<p id="line_432">“I want to shock the nobles from the neighboring nations a bit and give a reward of one hundred <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="stellar" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to whoever conquers the final floor!”</p>
<p id="line_433">“…?!”</p>
<p id="line_434">“Ho ho?”</p>
<p id="line_435">“EH?!”</p>
<p id="line_436">“About that—how much is that when you convert it to Japanese yen?”</p>
<p id="line_437"><em>I suppose it would be around a billion Japanese yen?</em></p>
<p id="line_438">Moreover, because of the low cost of living in this world, these coins would seem to be worth even more.</p>
<p id="line_439">“Surely, you must be exaggerating, right, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>

They would start hiring adventurers to participate in the labyrinth conquest.”</p>
<p id="line_441">In that case, there would be an even larger flow of money. Money comes with consumers. Once we planted the seed of interest within the population, everyone would be scared to miss out on the trend. Even those who had little care for the matter would start to be attracted.</p>
<p id="line_442">“Bu-but, that’s so much money we are talking…” Ramiris muttered worriedly. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, filled with confidence, was unfazed.</p>
<p id="line_443">“Well, I wonder who’s the ruler of this labyrinth?”</p>
<p id="line_444">He asked provocatively before giving Veldora a peek.</p>
<p id="line_445">Veldora reacted quickly.</p>
<p id="line_446">“Kukuku, ga-hahaha! It is I, the great True Dragon.

<p id="line_449">“Of course I knew that. Which is why, surely, there can’t be anyone who would be able to defeat Veldora-sama, isn’t that so?”</p>
<p id="line_450">“That goes without saying, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_452"><em>Oi oi, can you not drag me into this?</em></p>
<p id="line_453">While Veldora and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were laughing out loud, I was pondering over <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s proposal.

It was a pretty insane amount of money, but it was at the same time, the prize for successfully beating the final floor. In other words, the prize for defeating Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_454"><em>Well, that would be impossible.</em></p>
<p id="line_455">Though it might sound highly fraudulent, it wasn’t a lie. I should say that it’s still too early discussing the plausibility of that. From what I’ve seen so far, I really doubt anyone would truly make it to the one-hundredth floor.</p>
<p id="line_456">“He’s right. I think our labyrinth is unbeatable.”</p>
<p id="line_457">“Yup yup.”</p>
<p id="line_458">“That is most correct.”</p>
<p id="line_459">“That’s right. Perhaps people can still make it to Floor 50, but the difficulty levels beyond that are beyond my imagination. Don’t we even have dragons later, as well? How in the world are any adventurers supposed to defeat dragons?”</p>
<p id="line_460">Upon saying so, even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave a rather baffled expression.</p>
<p id="line_461">If someone as bold and greedy as him would not tread any further than that, it truly meant that our labyrinth was too well defended.</p>
<p id="line_462">“I doubt we’d ever have to pay out those hundred <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="stellar" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.”</p>
<p id="line_463">“That was the plan from the start. This is a bait for the nobles, therefore, I don’t think it’ll be a problem if we are to set the prize that high.

<p id="line_467">“Yes sir, I understand.”</p>
<p id="line_468">“Then I will trouble you to do some promotion and hopefully attract more participants.”</p>
<p id="line_469">“I’ll make sure to phrase it like an invitation to battle issued by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and put as much spice in it as possible!”</p>

In that way, even the freeloader Veldora will become a more valuable asset.</p>
<p id="line_472"><em>Okay, let’s do just that.</em></p>

<p id="line_480">That worried me a bit, so I asked: “What’s wrong? Is there something that’s bothering you?”</p>
<p id="line_481">“Well, it’s related to what we just discussed. People seemed to think I am still sitting on the idea, but I will probably need to fight that guy one day.”</p>
<p id="line_482">Fighting that guy—is he talking about the promise that he made during the tournament?</p>
<p id="line_483">“By that guy, do you mean <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_484">“That’s right… I’ve put the word out like that, so I can’t just run away. But if I were to really fight him, I will surely lose…”</p>
<p id="line_485">He had a point. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Unique Skill was incredibly special and possessed great utility. However, such utility was not much practical use in combat. Actually, he could win without fighting, through clever use of his Skill. So, I suppose, in a way, it was actually extremely suitable for combat.</p>
<p id="line_486">In any case, I couldn’t just do nothing about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s duel with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_487">Canceling the duel at this point was out of the question.</p>
<p id="line_488">“Would you like to get some training with the kids while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is in town?”</p>

<p id="line_491"><em>Perhaps I should show this guy a hard time for once</em>—with that thought in mind, however, wouldn’t it be strange for kids living in modern-time peaceful Japan to be aggressive and warmongering?</p>
<p id="line_492"><em>Now that I think about it, I am a lot like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</em></p>

<p id="line_495">“Right, and in turn, you should help me out as well.”</p>

<p id="line_498">It was a troublesome problem that we had to resolve somehow.

Anyway, I’d take my time about the matter.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_499">After some more casual chit-chat, the emergency meeting concluded. And we began to revamp the labyrinth starting on the same day.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_500">We were observing with high expectations. As I had predicted, we were fortunate to have corrected the problems pointed out by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The difficulty of the labyrinth was lowered quite a bit. But then again, I had taken <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s advice as well, so it shouldn’t be too simple either.</p>
<p id="line_501"><em>Now then, I wonder how everyone is reacting to the changes?</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_502">First of all, there were still many idiots who wouldn’t listen to instructions. Just as before, they ignored the tutorial missions and focused on progressing within the labyrinth instead. But, naturally, there was no way they could conquer the floors that easily.</p>
<p id="line_503">Even so, those were the inflexible people who kept on challenging floors over and over.</p>
<p id="line_504"><em>I wonder what drove them to do so?</em></p>
<p id="line_505"><em>Could it be that they had employers? Or out of their pride perhaps?</em></p>
<p id="line_506">The answers were never noble in any way. In fact, they were more practical reasons.</p>
<p id="line_507">The day the Labyrinth was made public, Basson’s party found a rare-grade sword from the treasure chest. To them it was a most incredible weapon. It seemed that the competitors had a drastically different understanding of things compared to us.</p>
<p id="line_508">Rare-grade equipment normally referred to an evolved version of a piece of quality equipment crafted with magisteel, after it experienced a long period of time, it eventually began to show special properties.</p>
<p id="line_509">The magisteel produced in our nation used iron ores mined from the mountain region by the high orcs. They were exposed to the magicules unleashed by Veldora which prompted their change in quality. That’s why as soon as these ores were moved to the storage section of the labyrinth, their quality began to change naturally.</p>
<p id="line_510">Not only was it easy to source, it was of very fine quality as well. And so, we generously used it as crafting material for equipment.</p>
<p id="line_511">Unlike the gear circulating the markets of the Western Nations, this equipment solely relied on magisteel to be crafted. Since they were different right down to the raw material, even the average gear in our nation’s garrison would appear to be special-grade to outsiders. Needless to say, it outperformed the challengers’ equipment by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p id="line_512">As for the gear worn by the soldiers of our nation, they were crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples. There were around a dozen of them working at the workshop. Under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s guidance, they were crafting equipment day in and day out. That’s why we got to produce gear in mass.</p>
<p id="line_513">Even these weapons crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples were all superior in quality when compared to the average gear being sold on the markets of the Western Nations, even approaching the quality of special-grade.</p>
<p id="line_514">These days, their creations were all put inside the treasure chests. The failed creations were destroyed and the ones that were deemed somewhat useful were placed in the treasure chests in the labyrinth. There was good gear and bad gear, but there was, nonetheless, outstanding work among them.</p>
<p id="line_515">One of them—a sword, barely making it to rare-grade, was taken by Basson.</p>
<p id="line_516">The rate for getting one of them was one in a hundred. This probability seemed to be the sweet spot regarding the chance of winning the jackpot.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_517">By the way, if it were crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, even his failed work would reach rare-grade. At first glance, you may think this was good stuff, but according to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> himself, these failures were just failures.</p>
<p id="line_518">“There is a distinct difference,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> declared.</p>
<p id="line_519">So, I did some intense digging and, eventually, I uncovered some insights. While both pieces of equipment were of the same grading, each piece had a lot of variance in terms of their stats. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could identify this and tell whether his work was a success or a failure.</p>
<p id="line_520">In fact, I compared the sword forged by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciple and his own creation. Both were rare-grade, yet their differences were very obvious. It was thanks to the increase in precision of my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ that I was able to realize the differences. Had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> not pointed it out for me, I probably would not have known how to tell them apart.</p>
<p id="line_521">To give an easy example, let’s say I copy a piece of equipment crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Obviously, the end product would be of the same grade. However, just like I’ve mentioned before, I could not recreate the quality. At first glance, the replica would appear to be the same as the original, but in truth, it was an inferior version of the original. This was the “difference.”</p>
<p id="line_522">The reason for such a phenomenon to occur was probably because my blacksmithing technique was not as good as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s.</p>
<p id="line_523">Therefore, I concluded that weapons had many different levels of quality. While even for weapon merchants, let alone amateurs, to tell such a difference, I started to understand how to differentiate good weapons from the bad.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_524">To those whose lives relied on the quality of their weapons, the difference could be crucial. You never knew when you would be ambushed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in this world. Weapons and armor with good quality could be their life-saving tools.</p>
<p id="line_525">During the founding festival, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s exhibition caused a stir among the public. There were even many people who wished to purchase his work. We were still considering that point, we planned to decide after doing some more market investigations.</p>
<p id="line_526">The guardian on the tenth floor would drop rare-grade equipment—one of the best masterpieces crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples. While it was far from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s work, it was still a high-grade item when compared to the average gear on the market.</p>
<p id="line_527">Adventurers, naturally, would want better gear. No wonder Basson was so happy about it. After all, for an average grade weapon, as long as its quality was nice, its price would also be ten times higher than the average ones in the market. Moreover, for special-grade, I had been told that it could go as high as fifty times the market price.</p>
<p id="line_528">As for rare-grade, it was all up to luck whether they could get it or not. It was rarely produced, and it wasn’t something you necessarily would be able to buy with money.</p>
<p id="line_529">Obviously, there would be people who get obsessed with the labyrinth and try to come back for more.</p>
<p id="line_530">Basson and his men were already promoting for us at the tavern.</p>
<p id="line_531">“Hey hey, check this out, people! This is the sword that is worthy of my skills!”</p>
<p id="line_532">Just like that, Basson and his posse were bragging with his weapon at every opportunity.</p>
<p id="line_533">The news that the tenth floor’s guardian would drop rare-grade equipment began to spread among the challengers. The news also began to reach the ears of the merchants as well as the members of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> across the continent.</p>
<p id="line_534">We never expected all these people wishing to become rich overnight would flood our nation. This was what led to the latest situation within the labyrinth.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_535">I really needed to thank Basson and his party for promoting our nation.</p>
<p id="line_536">That said, rushing straight into it was never a recipe for success in the labyrinth. After all, those who weren’t willing to listen to our instructions, were always beaten by people who finished their tutorial missions before challenging the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_537">Anyone with a bit of brain would know that the right thing to do was to listen to the instructions carefully first. Now, there were a lot more people who would do their tutorial mission seriously and receive their training on the first floor. The challengers were able to utilize the new knowledge they learned and apply it on the spot. There were also counters that sold various utility items, and this brought in a small fortune on its own.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_538">Moreover—</p>
<p id="line_539">A few days after our revamp of the labyrinth, there were teams that made their way to the fifth floor.</p>
<p id="line_540">The second floor was merely very wide, and up until the fourth floor, most of the traps were just for show. They were not exactly malicious in any way. As long as you sketched maps of the passages, it was a piece of cake to reach the fifth floor.</p>
<p id="line_541">That’s why it was a result that we expected.</p>
<p id="line_542">From the fifth floor onward, it was up to the challengers’ abilities. The lethality of the traps increased, and there were rank D and above <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> roaming around the area. On top of that, we also began to raise the chances of treasure chest containing more expensive items.</p>
<p id="line_543"><em>I do hope they will give it their best.</em></p>
<p id="line_544">While I was cheering for them, the people who made it to the fifth floor quickly got into tough fights. It was likely just because of their exhaustion. Having to be on guard against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> all the time would easily exhaust someone mentally.</p>
<p id="line_545">Many people returned to the stairs temporarily to use the resting zone. The business of the inns on Floor 95 had been booming as well, which was exactly what we wanted.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_546">Later, there were challengers that started making it to Floors 5 through 8. The adventurers from different nations’ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> branches had arrived as well. Among them were many skillful adventurers who were contracted by noblemen. The town had been bustling with life. People were discussing strategies with excitement.</p>
<p id="line_547">Because of the second group of people joining the battle, the morale of people who fought first was raised as well.</p>
<p id="line_548">It was then that some people began to cheat, ignoring proper rules of engagement and began to sell maps publicly within the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_549">Some people were probably super bad with direction like I am. Something like the labyrinth couldn’t be conquered with strength alone, that’s why I understood why they wanted to cheat in this way, but… I hoped they would just find companions to team up and assign each other’s role appropriately together.</p>
<p id="line_550">That’s why we were broadcasting, both inside and outside the labyrinth, that we would constantly change the internal layout. There were sad moans coming from the challengers all over the place, and many who just wouldn’t stop complaining about it. But I was the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—I was in no way obligated to listen to their opinions.</p>
<p id="line_551">I hoped to make them realize, sooner rather than later, that they wouldn’t be able to use maps not made by themselves. Essentially, if you didn’t make maps yourself, you would be unable to tackle the structural change of the labyrinth during your conquest. In a sense, this was a friendly reminder for them.</p>
<p id="line_552"><em>I suppose this is what they call tough love.</em></p>
<p id="line_553">The frequency of the layout changes was around once every two to three days. It would take at least a couple hours to break through one floor. It didn’t seem plausible that they’d make it to the checkpoint on the tenth floor without encountering a change.</p>
<p id="line_554">That’s why the change in the layout of the labyrinth had many benefits. Challengers would start to strategize properly and give up on buying and selling maps. There would probably be people starting the conquest as soon as the layout change began and try to sketch and sell maps within the same day. Those people could do whatever they wanted.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_555">We integrated this feature so as to prevent cheaters, and I was greatly satisfied with the result. However, we couldn’t underestimate our challengers, either.</p>
<p id="line_556">The adventurers from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to challenge the labyrinth as well. There were many who were capable caster of the elemental magic ‘Auto Mapping.’ Exploration became extremely easy for them.</p>
<p id="line_557"><em>These adventurers from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sure are different.</em></p>
<p id="line_558">Not only were they used to battling <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but their techniques were also very skillful. Moreover, their strong suit was their division of roles. Basson’ party only consisted of combat-type individuals, but the parties who joined later had well thought out structure of members.</p>
<p id="line_559">Against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there were raiders who specialize in combat.</p>
<p id="line_560">The traps and mazes were handled by explorers.</p>
<p id="line_561">There were also knowledgeable treasure hunters<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Kanji: 採取係, it’s a general term that refers to people who are good at gathering items, I can only assume it’s some very obscure game/novel reference because I can’t seem to find any modern trpg reference of this." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_562">The balance of a team was highly valued. As expected from adventurers who knew how to learn and adapt. They completed their missions with ease and challenged the labyrinth over and over.</p>
<p id="line_563">The people who were good at exploring ruins were also good at disabling traps. They were relatively calm when stumbling upon treasure chests, they were also more cautious compared to bodyguards or mercenaries. They had been displaying work ethic beyond our expectations. And they understood the rules almost instantly. I was fortunate that we didn’t make the labyrinth too easy.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_564">And so, a few days after the different teams began to come in, there were already people who made it through the tenth floor.</p>
<p id="line_565">The morale of the challengers was greatly boosted. They were studying the strategies of the people who came before them. Strategize carefully and progress through each floor gradually. Once a floor was beaten, the news would spread quickly. People then started to imitate their strategy.</p>
<p id="line_566">I suppose people were actually selling information about strategies.</p>
<p id="line_567"><em>Should I praise their resourcefulness?</em></p>
<p id="line_568">So now that they realized selling maps wouldn’t work, they began to sell information instead. About that, I did want to commend their efforts. We wanted the atmosphere to become livelier as well.</p>
<p id="line_569">The active performance of the challengers also became a topic of discussion among the townsfolk.</p>
<p id="line_570">Shops, inns, restaurants—the news travelled from one to another. There were legendary stories of tragedies, comedies, and more. It was then that one story in particular was gaining popularity. There was a team that was progressing at lightning-fast speed.</p>
<p id="line_571">They had a balanced team of ten people. What their team did to level up quickly was by sending one person to join another team that had already made it to Floor 10, register himself at the Floor 10 checkpoint and then utilized a Return Whistle to get back to the entrance. From there on, he rejoined his actual team and would start immediately from Floor 10 and onward.</p>
<p id="line_572">We were already expecting such things, that’s why we felt fine about it. Their progress had been shockingly fast, nonetheless. It only took them a short span of three days before defeating the guardian on the twentieth floor.</p>
<p id="line_573">These guys were truly capable. Each of their abilities were up to rank B. Their entire team was close to rank B-plus. Moreover, the ten men’s cooperation was extremely well-coordinated, making their actual strength closer to rank A-minus.</p>
<p id="line_574">It was almost impossible for me to not question their innocence, considering how fast they were progressing. The reason being, that they had been choosing the shortest route almost without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_575">«Answer. Spirit interference detected. ‘Spirit Communication’ conducted by a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="spirit wielder" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was found.»</p>

One of their magic skills was ‘Spirit Communication,’ the ability to hear words spoken by the spirit. If they could communicate with wind or earth spirits, they would be able to find the right path leading to the stairs with ease. Since they could gain such information, things such as maze were meaningless for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="spirit wielder" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.</p>

<p id="line_579">That said, they weren’t breaking any rules. Depending on the different properties of the spirits they commanded, even if they used ‘Spirit Communication,’ it wasn’t a guaranteed way to learn the correct route. Essentially, there were very few <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="spirit wielder" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s out there, which was why I had never expected them to pull such a move on us.</p>
<p id="line_580">It was a totally justified way of progressing in the labyrinth, so it didn’t warrant a response from us. I even wanted to praise them for coming up with an idea like this.</p>
<p id="line_581">It looked like their team would continue to progress at a fast pace. For each floor they made it through, their latest exploits would be broadcasted throughout town. These people rapidly rose to fame.</p>

<p id="line_585">Young and inexperienced challengers who dreamed of becoming famous and rich would trickle into town. And so, the number of challengers rose rapidly. The sales of the labyrinth were finally taking off.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_586">We gathered once more.</p>
<p id="line_587">It had been ten days since we last altered the layout of the labyrinth. Our meeting today was to discuss whether there were any new issues.</p>
<p id="line_588">Unlike last time, the meeting went smoothly, and everyone was content.</p>
<p id="line_589">I couldn’t help but smile at the situation.</p>
<p id="line_590">“Oi, you are called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, right? I knew from the start that you’ve got some balls, but it turned out that you are an incredibly courageous man.”</p>
<p id="line_591">As soon as the meeting started, Veldora, who was in a great mood, began to praise <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_592">“Eh, is that so? Thank you for the compliment…”</p>

<p id="line_594"><em>Who is this guy?</em> That seemed to be what he was trying to convey through his face as he turned to me.</p>
<p id="line_595">He was present last time during Veldora’s introduction. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was too nervous back then, so it wouldn’t be strange if he had forgotten about it.</p>
<p id="line_596">“Didn’t we introduce him last time—”</p>
<p id="line_597">“No, last time… Ehhh, the conference kind of just started on its own…”</p>

<p id="line_601"><em>No wonder <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was confused.

<p id="line_602">“Then I shall introduce him once more. This guy is my good friend, big bro Veldora. I asked him to act as the guardian for the one-hundredth floor.”</p>
<p id="line_603">“Umm, I am Veldora, and I recognize you.

<p id="line_604">Veldora seemed to have recognized <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as he greeted him with a happy smile.

<p id="line_608">“GAHAHAHA! My heart is as wide as the sea, and I seldom become angry! By the way, if you were to offer me some desserts, I would be generous enough to grant you my divine protection!”</p>
<p id="line_609">Veldora had gotten ahead of himself and said some foolish things.</p>
<p id="line_610">I rolled up my notebook at lightning speed and gave his head a whack.</p>

<p id="line_613">Probably out of shock, Veldora shouted “What the hell!” I then ignored him completely and began to introduce Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_614">“This here is Ramiris. She’s the fairy that runs the labyrinth.”</p>
<p id="line_615"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mumbled: “So I didn’t remember it wrong…” almost speechless before being brought back by my words.</p>
<p id="line_616">He turned to Ramiris who was fluttering her wings nearby.</p>
<p id="line_617">“Uh, y-yes… So Ramiris-san is a fairy. By the way, you are truly strong to have created such an incredible labyrinth,” he said to praise her.</p>
<p id="line_618">Hearing this, it was Ramiris’s turn to get a big head.</p>

<p id="line_639">“Ramiris-sama, please don’t force this upon him.

<p id="line_640">It’s probably because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s fan.

<p id="line_649"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed up: “That is a good point as well.

<p id="line_650"><em>I don’t get it.</em></p>
<p id="line_651">Ramiris decided to join in as well, “Ah, then that can’t be helped! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sure is cunning.”</p>
<p id="line_652">“Finders, keepers,” I answered rather uncaringly.</p>
<p id="line_653">For some reason, Veldora suddenly began to brag arrogantly on the side.</p>
<p id="line_654">“GAHAHA, there aren’t many reliable men like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> out there.

Or else this conversation can’t continue!”</p>
<p id="line_655">Even though I was actually very mindful of how these people think of me, I recalled that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hadn’t even finished introducing <em>himself</em>. Although, it seemed that everyone already knew his name, so this almost felt like an after-thought.</p>
<p id="line_656">“You have a point. Then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, please introduce yourself.”</p>
<p id="line_657">As I finished, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded as he replied, “Right.”</p>
<p id="line_658">“Some of you probably already know me, my name is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I came from the same world as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, that’s why I’m helping him out.

<p id="line_659"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> turned to face everyone, straightened his back, and began to introduce himself in earnest. When he called himself a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he seemed eager to add “That’s a running joke.” But considering <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was present, he didn’t say it out loud.</p>
<p id="line_660"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to adapt well and had already calmed down. He wasn’t the least bit emotionally scarred. Even though he had already met everyone here during the last conference, it was pretty impressive of him to be able to crack a smile in front of Veldora and Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_661"><em>He’s got great potential.</em></p>
<p id="line_662">Perhaps the reaction the bystanders had to him wasn’t entirely the doing of ‘Chosen One.’ Could it be that they were simply more influenced by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s own personality? I doubt his Unique Skill alone would have such a great impact. But, well, that’s something I’d have to examine in due course.</p>
<p id="line_663">While thinking this over, everyone had finished introducing themselves.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_664">We had all settled in our seats. Last time, we had an emergency meeting, but this time we were in no hurry. There was a casual mood in the air.</p>
<p id="line_665">“Speaking of which, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan, you are really good. Our success was all thanks to you!” Ramiris shouted excitedly as soon as she was seated.</p>
<p id="line_666">“While on the topic, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is mighty ingenious as well. Your call to not lower the difficulty of the labyrinth was remarkably prescient!” Veldora praised <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well.</p>
<p id="line_667">I agreed with both of their views.</p>
<p id="line_668"><em>Indeed, we can achieve great success when we all cooperate and contribute ideas.</em></p>
<p id="line_669">“You are too kind. I am glad to be of help for everyone.”</p>
<p id="line_670">“It was nothing extraordinary, it was all due to everyone’s hard work!”</p>
<p id="line_671">As they finished praising each other, we began to discuss the current state of the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_672">Our performances were looking up. During the peak sessions of the labyrinth, it was so good as to make <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shout with joy. Moreover, the visitors to the town would all rest at the inns and use the services of the restaurants. I heard that business had been booming lately.</p>
<p id="line_673">“Here are the reports,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said as he handed me some documents.</p>
<p id="line_674">Veldora and Ramiris were interested as well, so I gave them each a copy. I had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san run the numbers in detail. This way I would make sure that the content was in order.</p>
<p id="line_675"><em>Let’s see now.</em> I glanced through the report.</p>
<p id="line_676">Fortunately, I could turn into my humanoid figure in times like this. Even though I <em>could</em> still read documents in my slime form, in terms of efficiency in tackling work-related matters, the humanoid form was definitely much more convenient.</p>
<p id="line_677">It seemed that after our renovation to the labyrinth, it had been running smoothly. It could be verified by the statistics in this report.</p>
<p id="line_678">“Looks like our promotion has had a great effect.”</p>
<p id="line_679">“Yes sir!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded happily. “It’s been bustling with work every day.”</p>
<p id="line_680">I wasn’t sure if Veldora and Ramiris had a clue what they had in front of them, but they were staring at the report intently.</p>
<p id="line_681">The content was mainly the recent financial details with some special matters documented as well. For instance, adventurer ID card details.</p>
<p id="line_682"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s assistance so that we could check through adventurer ID cards to confirm permission to enter the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_683">It was a type of magical card that also monitors the user’s health status. It was a very convenient tool that occasionally recorded their status. The way to use the card was just like the explanation I got from the association’s help desk, so the adventurers were all very familiar with it. Bodyguards and mercenaries who were not part of the guild were in the minority, so it was very easy to integrate the system into our labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_684">The fee for entering the labyrinth was three silver coins.</p>
<p id="line_685">The card production was handled entirely by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was meant to reduce the workload at our service window. Our nation would issue a simplified version of the card as well at a price of ten silver coins.</p>
<p id="line_686">Most people had the card from the association, but occasionally there were people who would purchase the simplified cards. Considering the profits we reaped from that process, the entry fee for the labyrinth alone earned us a sizable income.</p>
<p id="line_687">In addition, the report also mentioned the three items crafted by Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_688">The Resurrection Bracelet—it was only given out for free the first time. The reason for providing a free sample was to allow people to experience the convenience of the product.</p>
<p id="line_689">They would have to purchase it from the second time onward. The price was two silver coins, a very reasonable price. Because this Resurrection Bracelet would heal all the severe wounds inflicted before death, and then revive the person. After much discussion, we came to the conclusion that we might as well give them this little bonus effect.</p>
<p id="line_690">In addition, if someone were to enter the labyrinth again without wearing the Resurrection Bracelet, we had to send a broadcast in order to get the attention of the person in question. Although they’d have to bear the responsibility, we still didn’t want lives to be lost out of negligence.</p>
<p id="line_691">To facilitate purchasing them, we situated the revival point next to the counter. This way, the Resurrection Bracelet became a necessity. It was selling like hotcakes—the best, in fact, among the three items.</p>
<p id="line_692">The item ‘Return Whistle’ was limited to single-person usage. The benefit of it was that it could return the user to the outside instantly. It was a life-savor when you got lost. In essence, it was an item made for emergency usage. Its price was rather high, at a cost of thirty silver coins.</p>
<p id="line_693">Those who tried to save some cash by buying a Resurrection Bracelet instead of a ‘Return Whistle’ should reconsider their choices. After all, while you could return to the entrance after death in this way, you also had a chance to lose your equipment. Despite keeping your armor intact, any weapons that fell out of your hands would be left behind. No one in their right mind fought while holding on to their loot, they were more likely to lay that stuff on the hallway floor. Subsequently, those goodies wouldn’t be extracted, and, in a sense, it was a penalty for death.</p>
<p id="line_694">There aren’t many people who risked returning by dying, that’s probably why the item sold that well.</p>
<p id="line_695">The sale of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Recording Crystal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a lot worse than we expected. However, there was a history where a large amount of it was purchased. It cost one gold coin, an expensive price as it would convert to around a hundred thousand yen. It looked like some people had the foresight to purchase this expensive item in large quantities.</p>
<p id="line_696">You could easily utilize death to return to the entrance by using this item. I’m guessing that some people may be very stubborn in challenging the guardians, so it’d be very dangerous to give away these items cheaply. This was why we set the price this high.</p>
<p id="line_697">Even with that being case, I still thought there would be demand for it. Upon reaching the deeper floors, the difficulty of the floors would increase drastically. Given that the checkpoint only appears every ten floors, it must give the challengers the impression of trying to reach heaven’s gate.</p>
<p id="line_698">I always thought that it would one day become profitable, even if just a little. Some people would, surely, find it useful.</p>
<p id="line_699">There were also other ideas, such as lending weapons and armor. But they didn’t seem to be profitable yet. This gear was prepared by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they were of excellent quality. The only people using this seemed to be the ones who lost their weapons during their last attempt. However, it was slowly gaining popularity. When the rumors surrounding the amazing quality of the weapons spread far and wide, surely, there would be more people renting them.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_700">Everything seemed to be going smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_701">However, even if we finally landed some success, we still couldn’t get careless. Times like these require even more caution.</p>
<p id="line_702">The fastest progressing team had been doing well. So far no one had deserted. They were gradually delving into deeper floors.</p>
<p id="line_703">Fortunately for us, they managed to inspire other challengers’ motivation. They would come back to the labyrinth even after failed attempts, and our sales had been going up because of it.</p>
<p id="line_704"><em>We must maintain this flow.</em></p>
<p id="line_705"><em>“I want to challenge the labyrinth again”</em>—if we could get everyone to think that, it would be surprisingly easy to get over a thousand customers in one day.</p>
<p id="line_706">“Well then, according to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s report, we have been very successful. However, we must not be satisfied just yet. Please feel free to express any feedback you have.”</p>
<p id="line_707">In order to keep everyone on their toes, I said this to give it a head start.</p>
<p id="line_708">Ramiris was the first to react.</p>
<p id="line_709">“I got something!”</p>
<p id="line_710">“Then Ramiris-kun, please take the stage.”</p>
<p id="line_711">“Well, it’s about the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="spirit wielder" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Spirit Communication.’ It’s a blind spot for us where they can gain information from the spirits! But I can actually interfere with it! So, what should we do?”</p>
<p id="line_712">“Hmm—interference you say…”</p>
<p id="line_713">Although I did want to sabotage them a bit, that did also seem rather despicable. Because our customers were using totally valid ways of progressing, if we were to use unethical tricks to interfere it would seem to be unfair.</p>
<p id="line_714">This was not a war, nor some competition.</p>
<p id="line_715">“You are sure that the spirits are not being forced into service, right?”</p>
<p id="line_716">“No, they aren’t. It’s evidence that the spirits like them if they are able to build such a trustworthy relationship with them.”</p>
<p id="line_717">“If that’s the case, then we shouldn’t interfere. I dislike the idea.”</p>
<p id="line_718">“Right! I half guessed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would say so.”</p>
<p id="line_719">Ramiris compromised immediately. While she did propose it, she likely didn’t want to do it either.</p>
<p id="line_720">“Indeed, lying is no good. But Ramiris, how about you create a zone without any spirit? That ‘Spirit Communication’ thing, isn’t it used to hear what the local spirits have to say? Would it therefore be rendered useless if there aren’t any spirits to begin with?”</p>
<p id="line_721">Oh, this surprising response came from Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_722"><em>He’s usually very useless, and to think he’s come up with such clever words.</em></p>

<p id="line_724"><em>Yikes, this guy is sharp.</em></p>
<p id="line_725">“Nothing, only that I feel truly impressed. I thought just now, <em>as expected from Veldora</em>. Your suggestion was very good!”</p>
<p id="line_726">I panicked a bit trying to answer him.</p>
<p id="line_727">Yet Veldora’s mood was immediately cheered up afterward.</p>
<p id="line_728">“Right? My wisdom has finally come in handy, GA-HAHAHA!”</p>
<p id="line_729">He sure got fooled fast.</p>
<p id="line_730">“Well, what about it, Ramiris?”</p>
<p id="line_731">“Umm, no problem! I can ask the spirits to change their residence. Without spirits that possess will, the challengers won’t be able to activate ‘Spirit Communication’!”</p>
<p id="line_732">Looks like there isn’t any problem.</p>
<p id="line_733">Thanks to Veldora, we would have a chance against the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="spirit wielder" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.</p>
<p id="line_734">“Then I’ll be counting on you. It’s great to have been able to exchange ideas like that.”</p>
<p id="line_735">“Indeed, you are correct, my wisdom—”</p>
<p id="line_736">“Yep, next one. Does anyone else want to give his suggestion?”</p>
<p id="line_737">I can’t have Veldora keep acting smug anymore.</p>
<p id="line_738">Let’s get to the next person.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_739">The person who then raised his view was, again, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_740">“Isn’t it the case that you can’t get any items from defeating <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_741"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> upon death would drop items—these are common occurrences in video games, but it would seem bizarre in real life. I figured it was enough that you could extract materials or ‘Magic Crystals’ from defeated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…</p>
<p id="line_742">“Will it be necessary?” Veldora asked.</p>
<p id="line_743">To which <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s answer was very simple.</p>
<p id="line_744">“Eh? Not really, it’s just that the healing potions are surprisingly expensive. High ranking adventurers may have the spare cash to use them sparingly, but most average men won’t bear to use them. Instead, they would choose to flee. Some people probably think that, if you can be revived without a scratch inside the labyrinth, you might as well endure more defeats as opposed to spending the money buying potions. That’s why, we might as well have <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> drop some low tier healing potions so that everyone can easily access them? But that’s just my view.”</p>
<p id="line_745">Umm—he had a point.</p>
<p id="line_746">Healing potions were among the list of things being promoted in our nation. People were gradually realizing their practical value. However, it wasn’t exactly cheap. And the price had hindered the number of customers from growing any faster.</p>
<p id="line_747">In our nation, a lower healing potion would cost four silver coins. While a higher healing potion was sold for thirty-five silver coins. And regarding full healing potions, we weren’t even selling them on the market. And even if we did, it would cost somewhere around five hundred silver coins to five gold coins, and more.</p>
<p id="line_748">The cost of living in our nation’s cheapest inn, accounting solely for lodging, cost three silver coins. It cost five silver coins instead for included baths and a meal. Better inns, used mainly by merchants, cost around ten silver coins, excluding meals. This is the equivalent of a rank D challenger’s entire day’s worth of work within the labyrinth. The average income was around fifteen silver coins. And even with a team to improve efficiency, it fell around twenty silver coins. This income was passable for now. It was sufficient to make a living with this money.</p>
<p id="line_749">But it may not be the case for any emergency situations. For instance, them falling sick or being severely wounded. They had no chance to experience a complete social welfare system. In addition, it was also important to maintain their weapons and armor. They’d need to replace them when they were broken. They would also have to save up money to purchase better gear.</p>
<p id="line_750">Low rank adventurers had a hard time even hunting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In order to improve their quality of life, they would have to train themselves to become better.</p>
<p id="line_751">It was quite challenging for these people to just pay four silver coins. After all, they also had to save up for the entry fee of the labyrinth. I could understand their feelings when they could only watch and were not willing to purchase…</p>
<p id="line_752">If they were to come across a treasure chest, they would become rich overnight, but still, I didn’t think they really had the capacity to waste any of their savings.</p>
<p id="line_753">“That is a common setting in video games. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had a point, however… All of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the labyrinth are spawned naturally. It’s not that simple to have them all carry items—”</p>
<p id="line_754">These people weren’t my subjects anyway, there was no reason I should give them such convenience so easily. While I wished to help them, they should first try to survive on their own.</p>
<p id="line_755">After all, there was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> for such circumstances. They were not the citizens of this town, so I couldn’t grant them aid in the name of the nation.</p>
<p id="line_756">Unfortunately, this was the reality, who couldn’t keep up was left behind—</p>
<p id="line_757">“We probably can do it.”</p>
<p id="line_758">As I was almost about to give up, Ramiris’s carefree voice rang in my ears.</p>
<p id="line_759">“You serious?”</p>
<p id="line_760">“Yeah, all we have to do is to feed the items to the newborn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_761">Assuming we could do that, it opened the door for all manner of possibilities. We could have treasure chests keeping all the good stuff, while the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would drop all the garbage. But even if it were garbage, to low rank challengers, they would be a source of their income.</p>
<p id="line_762">This would, in fact, be a welcome change for low rank challengers in the future. If you can work hard, you will be rewarded. Such an environment, to me, was most ideal.</p>
<p id="line_763">“Then there shouldn’t be an issue. You will get rewards just by defeating <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, surely, the challengers would work even harder now.”</p>
<p id="line_764">In this way, there could be more <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> materials circulating the market. It may even become a specialty of our nation. When we have enough profit, we may even invest part of it on healthcare. Any sickness would be covered, and even if you were to be severely wounded, there could be solutions. It’ll be just like Japan. Having a healthcare system for all citizens will be a dream no more.</p>
<p id="line_765">If such a policy were not implemented quickly after the founding of a nation, it would seem very unfair to the people. Because of this possibility, we should enact it as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="line_766">The recognition of citizenship also posed a problem. The challengers of the labyrinth, travelling merchants, these people were all not citizens. They should try to register as citizens now to get their rights. At this time, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was still developing. That’s why we welcomed immigrants. But perhaps once our nation matured, we may even come down against immigration. The so-called nation, at its core, is just a massive mutual assistance organization. People can’t live on their own, that’s why they form communal groups to help each other out. That’s why we didn’t want any parasites in this nation. Neither did we want to accept people with no will of staying. It would be difficult to assimilate people with different ideologies to the same group.</p>
<p id="line_767">When you possess citizenship to a nation, you are obligated to contribute to the nation. That was also why you get to enjoy the rights for serving the nation. Those who do not belong to any nation, they won’t have to afford any duty and they can roam freely.</p>
<p id="line_768">I wasn’t the one making the choice. It was up to the people visiting Tempest. If they were willing to submit their loyalty to Tempest, I welcomed them. Otherwise, they were guests. We wouldn’t be able to provide the same welfare that the citizens received, that needed to be distinguished.</p>
<p id="line_769">It seemed that I need to discuss the matter in detail with Rigurd.</p>
<p id="line_770">—And things along those lines, for once I was actually pondering over things seriously.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_771">As I was in the midst of my thoughts, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to speak to me.</p>
<p id="line_772">“Is it true? If that’s the case, we can actually mix in unidentified potions, or weapons and gear that have unknown effects. Shouldn’t we do that so that people won’t be able to identify which ones are the truly high-valued items?”</p>
<p id="line_773"><em>Oh yeah. We are in the middle of a meeting.</em></p>
<p id="line_774">I quickly considered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words.</p>
<p id="line_775"><em>I see, I get what he meant.</em></p>
<p id="line_776">“Could it be? Are you making it so that they won’t be able to use the items unless they appraise them at the counter?”</p>
<p id="line_777">“That’s it! That said, most people probably won’t drink unidentified potion anyway.”</p>
<p id="line_778">“Perhaps some people would. We can mix it with poison. It can be considered as a form of trap. It can be a good reminder for people to remember doing appraisal. We gotta put it into practice.”</p>
<p id="line_779">“Cursed type equipment could prove to be an interesting challenge, but magic weapons may also be interesting. They would probably think it’s trash at first, but their true quality can only be revealed after appraisal.”</p>
<p id="line_780">“That’s great! You can’t even toss away random trash; you have to leave the labyrinth to do the appraisal.”</p>
<p id="line_781">I began to discuss all these video game ideas with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_782">Most surprisingly, an idea that we can implement was forming. We began to get excited.</p>
<p id="line_783">Hearing our conversations, Ramiris and Veldora also got a giddy look on their faces.</p>
<p id="line_784">“If you want them to hide their true forms, you can use my ‘Illusion Magic’!”</p>
<p id="line_785">“GAHAHAHA, I’m getting worked up just thinking about the troubled and confused looks on those challengers. Looks like I’m gonna have plenty of fun in the future!”</p>
<p id="line_786">These two seemed highly motivated as well.</p>
<p id="line_787">“Hmm, hmm. Trash gear is gonna take up their valuable space, so you will have to go back to town to sell them. I somehow feel like sales of the ‘Return Whistle’ are gonna take off,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> expressed this practical view.</p>
<p id="line_788">Hearing his words, that did seem to be the case. It would certainly make people feel reluctant if they had to throw away unidentified weapons or armors—it would definitely trouble people who liked to roam the labyrinth for good items once such an idea was put into practice.</p>
<p id="line_789">Every time they entered the labyrinth, it would also charge them an entry fee. The increase in the number of entries would also bring up the profit margin. After all, we wouldn’t be the only one having fun now.</p>
<p id="line_790">Unidentified—how charming does that sound? Bearing the excitement of waiting for the result of the appraisal, that was quite fun in itself. Your brain’s gonna explode out of excitement.</p>
<p id="line_791">What you thought was garbage turned out to be a treasure. In this way, even if it really were trash, people would still value it a lot. I didn’t think we needed to put in too many big prizes. Instead, we could increase the drop rate of the low healing potions. That way, we could support the lower rank customers. We would need to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p id="line_792">“I see, then it’s about time we work in that direction.”</p>
<p id="line_793">“A patch update, right?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed up.</p>
<p id="line_794">I shouldn’t have said “about time,” I did just acknowledge his idea.</p>
<p id="line_795">With that being said, “patch update” was a great term.</p>
<p id="line_796">“That’s a nice way to put it.”</p>
<p id="line_797">Ramiris nodded along, as if she understood everything that was happening.</p>
<p id="line_798"><em>Oi. Did you really get all that</em>—with that message in mind, I turned to her, but she immediately averted her eyes.</p>
<p id="line_799">It looked like she was just playing along with the atmosphere. This gal only knew petty tricks like this.</p>
<p id="line_800"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave off an evil grin, Veldora burst out in laughter as he always did.</p>
<p id="line_801">We looked at each other and nodded in agreement.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_802">Moving on to the next evening.</p>
<p id="line_803">It was another day of serious work. I have been patrolling the town during the day—definitely not idling around for fun, absolutely not. I had also been listening to reports at night. The location was my office.</p>
<p id="line_804">Most of the paperwork was handled by Rigurd, though some important matters would only be approved by me personally. I had someone prepare rooms in the duty hall to handle these.</p>

<p id="line_806">She had been working hard. It’s like she was an actual secretary now. I was a bit surprised by her.</p>
<p id="line_807">“Um, good work,” I said in my most lord-like manner before taking the reports from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s hand.</p>
<p id="line_808">It seemed to be the outline based on yesterday’s meeting. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> got the documents ready at lightning-fast speed.</p>

<p id="line_811">“The sales in the bars have gone up ten percent lately. Looks like the lower rank challengers have been making profits. It’s good for the townsfolk as well.”</p>
<p id="line_812">“Indeed.

<p id="line_930">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> King was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that fell under rank B-plus, and his subordinates were each rank B as well. Even one rank B <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> alone could drive a small village to the verge of extinction. With such a troupe of strong enemies to face off against, it took some genuine strength in order to make it through Floor 30.</p>
<p id="line_931">Nevertheless, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s group succeeded with little difficulty. Jinrai’s defense went up by equipping the mithril<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Kanji reads Magic Silver (analogous to Magisteel)" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> full plate armor I gifted to him. Thanks to that, apparently it became a viable strategy to use him as bait. Maybe because the other members were fairly skilled too, they were able to focus on offense and use powerful magic. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Bernie" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Elemental Magic,’ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Jiwu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Spirit Magic,’ and compensation effects from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘Chosen’—the combination of these factors had elevated the base power of their team substantially.</p>
<p id="line_932"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> claimed that he didn’t do anything, but he was already helping them by just standing there.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_933">“And yet… This sounds weird coming from me, but the publicity has been great. In particular, the rare-grade equipment from the special series coming out of the treasure chest was very charming.”</p>
<p id="line_934">“Right? That’s what I was thinking.”</p>
<p id="line_935">If you managed to collect the full set of a series, the equipment would gain a special effect—that was among the ideas that I exchanged with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He apparently remembered and put together a prototype—that was the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> series.</p>
<p id="line_936">The golden chest in the thirtieth floor’s boss room would contain exactly one random item from this series. This was another dirty scheme.</p>
<p id="line_937">The weapon was randomly selected from among the five types: axe, sword, bow, saber, or knife. As for the armor, it could be a helmet, chest plate, gauntlets, greaves, or boots, but there weren’t any shields available.</p>
<p id="line_938">What you would find depended on your luck. The only certainty was that the gear would be part of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> series. Therefore, whether it would be a weapon or a piece of armor, even that came down to chance. Besides, there was no guarantee that a weapon or piece of armor would drop in the first place, since the golden chest the guardian was guarding was set to only have a two percent chance of containing rare-grade gear. Even if you managed to bring the boss down in one hour, that totaled to opening twenty-four treasure chests in one day. By that calculation, it was fine for rare gear to show up once every two days.</p>
<p id="line_939">This was optimal to stimulate the gambling spirit. It was human nature to desire collecting things that belonged to a series, and if they happened to receive duplicates, they could always trade or sell them. With this, we could give an extra incentive to challenge the labyrinth.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_940">“What I got were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Greaves.”</p>
<p id="line_941">“Yeah, you see, if you gather all five armor pieces, it will activate a powerful ‘Magic Interference’ effect as magic resistance.”</p>
<p id="line_942">This was the same effect that was on the scale shield I had gifted to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kabal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That one could activate the effect on its own, but for these you needed to gather a complete set to unlock it. That was the difference between unique-grade and rare-grade.</p>
<p id="line_943">To put it bluntly, the weapons and armor of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> series were made from magisteel mixed with the leftover scraps we had after processing the Charybdis scales. That’s why the magic resistance effect was pretty strong.</p>
<p id="line_944">It worked against the tempest serpent’s ‘Poison Breath’ as well, so, by all means, it was worth collecting.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_945">“Is that so?”</p>
<p id="line_946">“Yeah. That’s why I want you to gather all of them and challenge the next boss, and hopefully, that will become our game plan for the future.”</p>
<p id="line_947">As <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s group broke through floor thirty, the existence of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> series went public, and it was only a matter of time before this information was spread around the world. With this, no doubt, the challengers would be burning with the desire to try their luck. And the sheer number of people wanting to conquer the labyrinth would rise to new heights.</p>
<p id="line_948">Parties were limited to a maximum of ten people. No matter how strong the troupe of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was, if the challengers managed to form a party of rank B and above, then it wouldn’t remain an insurmountable opponent. They might fail a few times here and there, but if you considered it as practice against a group of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, then this offered a great deal of experience. Like that, I hoped for them to gather powerful gear and set their gaze on the floors ahead.</p>
<p id="line_949">This was a flawless plan, and everything went according to it.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_950">“So, if that’s the intention…would it be good for me to gather that series, too?”</p>
<p id="line_951">“Well, that’s a tough question. The mithril armor I gave Jinrai is equally rare-grade but has no special ability. However, it offers a higher defense than the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Chest plate. As it is, you probably could beat even the tempest serpent if you really pushed it.”</p>
<p id="line_952">The tempest serpent may have been strong, but you only needed to face one of them. If you challenged it with a party, one person could serve as bait whom you could constantly heal while fighting the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In their case, Jinrai would take on that role, but I was sure he’d do just fine.</p>
<p id="line_953">“Then we’ll head straight to the next floor.”</p>
<p id="line_954">“Okay. Your active participation has been a great advertisement, so keep up the good work!”</p>
<p id="line_955">“Jinrai and my other colleagues are more excited than I am, though. I guess it’s more fun now that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> drop items. Of course, finding treasure makes me happy, too.”</p>
<p id="line_956"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> dropping various items—this suggestion was brilliant. Some <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, like skeletons, didn’t yield any usable materials, and the ‘Magic Crystal’ was often of poor quality. From those, you could only earn a handful of change, so the higher the people’s ranks were, the more of a hassle it would be to them.</p>
<p id="line_957">But now, the situation had been flipped on its head. Those people who used to begrudgingly fight <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> out of necessity, had started to aggressively hunt them down.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_958">The market was booming with the trade of materials, the result was truly magnificent.</p>
<p id="line_959">It was surprisingly easy to make the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that spawned inside the labyrinth drop items.

What they did was force the newly spawned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to swallow items whole—putting it that way made it sound like a tough job.</p>
<p id="line_960">It was difficult to know where <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would spawn inside the labyrinth. Figuring that out was very tedious. But the truth is, that there was no need to do that.</p>
<p id="line_961">The amount of magicules flowing to each floor was managed by special pipelines. We set up rooms on the fifth floor and below for these pipes to pass through. That way, we created a system where large hordes of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would spawn in specific rooms—these were the so-called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> rooms.</p>
<p id="line_962"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s group, the labyrinth managers, distributed the items I prepared to each room, then released <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that swallowed them. It would’ve been a hassle to manage every <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> inside the labyrinth, but when narrowed down to just the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> rooms, taking care of them was a piece of cake. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that spawned in the passageways didn’t carry any items, but we could wave that problem away by calling them blanks.</p>
<p id="line_963">Like this, we were able to efficiently deploy <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with items on each floor.</p>
<p id="line_964">The way I intended it, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> room was a kind of trap in its own right. But for now, its bigger purpose was to serve as a room that managed the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Naturally, there would also be those unlucky enough to stumble into the room while it was a crowded <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> den…but that, too, was a way to raise the tension.</p>
<p id="line_965">All things considered, the alluring profits the labyrinth had in store were what everyone was fascinated by.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_966">“The appraisers are in for a treat! They receive one silver per session, yet the waiting line has no end in sight.”</p>
<p id="line_967">You could find fruit juice and milk with preservation magic applied to keep them fresh for several days, along with low potions, among other things. On the other hand, there were also drinks that spoiled within a few days, so appraisal was a must.</p>
<p id="line_968">There were also failed works by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s students; those garbage weapons were being sold at a low price.</p>
<p id="line_969">It might look like we were operating at a loss, but it was more like a giveaway. We could think of it as reinvesting a portion of our profit to bring in more customers. And speaking of the giveaway, there was a jackpot.</p>
<p id="line_970">Occasionally, masterworks <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples made would be mixed in. These were an absolute hit, and the number of people who showed off the special-grade gear they earned in the labyrinth increased.</p>
<p id="line_971">This lavish feast had caught everyone’s heart. Like ants attracted to sugar, they challenged the labyrinth day in and out. Items obtained from various treasure chests, prize money for breaking through every tenth floor, and loot from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—once the challengers got a taste for these various treats, they soon became regulars.</p>
<p id="line_972">As you could see, the operation of the labyrinth was going well.</p>
<p id="line_973">Inevitably, the town was bustling with activity.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_974">“The ninety-fifth floor is also thriving!” Ramiris triumphantly announced, to which everyone happily nodded.</p>
<p id="line_975">That’s right, we prepared a new inn at the ninety-fifth floor, and this, too, was a smashing success.</p>
<p id="line_976">We had prominently placed a room in front of the stairs on each floor, featuring an unusual door with the word “inn” inscribed upon it. Next to it, there was a doorbell on the wall, wired up to call a labyrinth manager. Once summoned, they would illustrate the wonders that lay beyond the door.</p>
<p id="line_977">To open it, you needed but three silver coins. It was the same cost as the labyrinth’s entry fee, but for those who toiled away in continuous battles, it was a price they gladly paid. After all, most of the people who heard the pitch ended up using the service.</p>
<p id="line_978">And there was a definite reason for that: The structure of the labyrinth was ever-changing. Once every two or three days the labyrinth shifted. This made any attempt at challenging the labyrinth far more difficult than it may have seemed.</p>
<p id="line_979">There were very few people who didn’t get lost within the vastness of the labyrinth, and there were countermeasures to prevent the ‘Spirit Communication’ of spirit-wielders.</p>
<p id="line_980">Therefore, it became difficult to determine the shortest route. In other words, it was difficult to get to the tenth floor in just one day, forcing many to sleep within the labyrinth’s halls.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_981">“Seriously, this is my first time camping out in the open.”</p>
<p id="line_982">“How’d it go? It sounds quite fun?”</p>
<p id="line_983">“No, no, it might be all right for you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, but sleeping on the cold, hard, stone pavement not only makes it easy for you to get sick, but also makes your muscles ache. Although, aside from me and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Bernie" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the other two lay down comfortably like they’re used to it…”</p>
<p id="line_984">Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Jiwu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, being a girl, didn’t complain about camping out. However, sleeping while taking turns watching out for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> ambushes seemed to torment <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_985">“I see. It must’ve been very hard.”</p>
<p id="line_986">“Please don’t say it like it’s none of your business! I’m not gonna sleep there again,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said with a grimace, likely having flashbacks.</p>
<p id="line_987">For these modern kids it was apparently too much to ask. This wasn’t only a problem among ‘Otherworlders,’ but the locals had a tough time, too.</p>
<p id="line_988">Even if you secured a room with a treasure chest and slept inside it, you would need someone to keep watch. There were also those who wandered the labyrinth without ever catching any sleep or taking a rest, so providing a place where they could relax and go to bed was highly appreciated, more than we had thought.</p>
<p id="line_989">Also, it would’ve been a waste to dump the gear you had earned to the wayside. This was also part of the plan, because even if it looked like useless items, there was a chance that something good might’ve been mixed in.</p>
<p id="line_990">Besides that, food and bedding for several days, replacements and maintenance supplies for gear—they had to bring these necessities, setting a limit on how many of the items they found they would be able to tote along.</p>
<p id="line_991">When there was no more room to spare, the easiest thing to cut down on was food. Running out of supplies left you with no other option but turning back, however, some of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were edible and could be killed for food. Water could be replenished with the use of magic, leading many to hold out with the bare minimum of rations.</p>
<p id="line_992">Even in the worst case, as long as you had the Resurrection Bracelet you could get resurrected after death. In those cases, there was a possibility you would lose your items, but that was apparently deemed preferable to starvation.</p>
<p id="line_993">This brought the spotlight back to the ‘Return Whistle,’ raising discussions about its usefulness, and, because you could leave with all of your items in hand, there was a great surge in purchases lately.</p>
<p id="line_994">In that way, to maximize the number of items you could take, reducing the amount of food had become mainstream.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_995">What if, in that situation, there was an inn that could be used inside the labyrinth?</p>
<p id="line_996">Merely returning to the stairs was all it took to reach the inn. Doing so, made it redundant to carry food and bedding, allowing you to travel lightly.</p>
<p id="line_997">If there was an inn available, it was only natural to use it.</p>
<p id="line_998">A safe resting place was available for three silver coins—the same amount as the labyrinth’s entry fee. That was triple the price of those on the surface, so it was a tad expensive, but you were also offered food. And so, with three silver in your pocket, you could use the inn and stay for a night.</p>
<p id="line_999">The building was divided up between male and female and offered only tiny areas with nothing more than a bed like in a capsule hotel.</p>
<p id="line_1000">To be honest, the service wasn’t as good as above ground.</p>
<p id="line_1001">The management of this place was left to the treants, and they used it as a place to train new employees. Cleaning, laundry, cooking and serving the customers. They let the inexperienced trainees get their practice here, and if they passed, they would then be allowed to work on the surface.</p>
<p id="line_1002">Nevertheless, the people who used it would still use it.</p>
<p id="line_1003">You could buy safety in exchange for money, so this was no time to complain. Also, there were fancy additional services available for those who could afford it.</p>
<p id="line_1004">Laundry wash: three silver coins.</p>
<p id="line_1005">Public bath usage: three silver coins.</p>
<p id="line_1006">Gear cleaning and repair: five silver coins.</p>
<p id="line_1007">These were our pricey, exclusive services, and yet, there was a surprising number of customers using them. Constantly fighting in the labyrinth meant you’d inevitably be soaked in blood and sweat. Women, in particular, were bothered by the smell, so baths were greatly welcomed.</p>
<p id="line_1008">For that reason, we raked in a lot more revenue inside the labyrinth than above ground, and the profit margins were excessively higher to boot.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1009">Even if you didn’t use it as an inn, there were times when you just needed a place to take a break and being able to safely use the bathroom without worry seemed to have been a major selling point.</p>
<p id="line_1010">After having it pointed out by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and digging a little deeper, this seemed to have been giving everyone a hard time.</p>
<p id="line_1011">There were no bathrooms in the labyrinth. When side by side with death, you had to muster the determination to just let it leak if need be.</p>
<p id="line_1012">There was no need to clean up, either, since the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that spawned would take care of it on their own. The slimes inside the labyrinth would eat anything and everything. Excrement, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> corpses, or debris, it was all the same to them.</p>
<p id="line_1013">Even when those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were slain by the adventurers, a replacement would spawn in no time. Thanks to that, we didn’t need to worry about cleaning up after anyone. Besides, every time the structure of the labyrinth shifted, the unnecessary trash was eliminated. And so, surprisingly, the labyrinth was always kept clean and tidy.</p>
<p id="line_1014">Yet in spite of all that, the issue regarding toilets remained.</p>
<p id="line_1015">From the labyrinth management’s perspective, having the whole place stink was a ‘shitty’ situation. But as if that weren’t bad enough, the challengers had another problem to deal with: getting attacked by a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> at your most defenseless state of times, that would likely drive anyone to tears. You could shout “Time out!” all you wanted, but the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> held themselves to no such courtesies.</p>
<p id="line_1016">For both numbers one and two, you’d always need someone keeping watch. But you may feel ill at ease when quickly doing your business while your partners were protecting you.</p>
<p id="line_1017">Maybe less so when you only had to take a leak—no, definitely both would be unpleasant.</p>
<p id="line_1018">Now imagine <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> showing up at the same time, that would be the absolute worst time for a fight.</p>
<p id="line_1019">Soiling your pants during combat—I don’t even want to imagine it.</p>
<p id="line_1020">If that happened to you, the first impulse would be to run back to your group that very instant, but to have them see you wetting your pants before their eyes, what an absolute humiliation. A man might laugh it off, but this would, surely, be a life-or-death situation for a woman. At worst, I’d bet some would rather choose death in those instances.</p>
<p id="line_1021">Mixed parties of men and women weren’t uncommon either, so it was no surprise that the inns would see a lot of visitors, considering the toilet situation.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1022">Incidentally, there were those who took care of it with the help of some magic. They said that they managed their condition with the use of daily magic ‘Health Care’ or ‘Clean Wash’ within the labyrinth. ‘Health Care’ was said to help you manage your bowel movements. Although there was a limit, I heard that they could hold it for about three days with no problem.</p>
<p id="line_1023">For everyone who didn’t fancy wetting themselves during battle, this was said to be an essential spell. Nonetheless, one would be remiss to forget about its limit. If you planned to wander the labyrinth for a long time, relying on magic alone would be like playing shitty Russian roulette.</p>
<p id="line_1024">And so, even those who could cast magic gradually used the inns as well.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1025">As it stood, the management of the labyrinth was going very smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_1026"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave the income report with a gleeful look on his whole face, “Things are going smoothly, ladies and gentlemen. Revenue has been steadily climbing. Even after deducting the necessary expenses, such as the loot items distributed in the labyrinth, we are still making enough profit. As for the return on our investment, we’re currently at around ten percent. We are aiming for twenty percent, and seeing as the number of users increases, I predict we will be able to achieve it.”</p>
<p id="line_1027"><em>Hmm Hmm, everything is roughly as expected.</em></p>
<p id="line_1028">The loot was valued at its market selling price in these calculations, not the raw production costs, meaning that the real profit margin was even higher. Not only that, but the residents working in the city were not being paid a single copper, letting all of the money flow straight into the state treasury.</p>
<p id="line_1029">“Looks like it’s all right to increase my investments.”</p>
<p id="line_1030">“If we do that, we might have to wait a while before the country becomes profitable, but it would not take long to be in the black.”</p>
<p id="line_1031">If all we wanted was to turn a profit, we could’ve simply sold goods we produced at a high price, but that alone didn’t make us a legitimate nation.</p>
<p id="line_1032">There were people engaged in various jobs around town, and only when the work was appropriately divided, could everyone do their best. Therefore, I thought it to be important to create an environment where everyone could work with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Work for every citizen of this country—in other words, it was my job as king to offer them a worthwhile life.</p>
<p id="line_1033">—That being said, I didn’t think it was good to continue the status quo.</p>
<p id="line_1034">“But, you know, not getting paid is a bit…”</p>
<p id="line_1035">“In fact, our funds are sufficient to cover paying everyone a salary equivalent to the average salary in the kingdom of Blumund. It’s just that people haven’t taken it…” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p id="line_1036">As a merchant, it would be out of the question for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to work free of charge. It was a feeling I could deeply sympathize with. Going without a paycheck was a glaring issue on so many levels. We guaranteed food, clothing and housing, and everyone seemed to be happy with that, and yet… This was verging on outright exploitation, so it was about time to pay them what they were owed.</p>
<p id="line_1037">I was thinking about it, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was perfectly managing it for me. And probably thanks to that, there weren’t any complaints piling up. There would have to be discussions about the matter with Rigurd and the other three officials.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1038">While the residents were satisfied despite the lack of pay, there were those who were true to their desires.</p>
<p id="line_1039">“Th-then there won’t be an issue with my paycheck, right?” Ramiris asked with a gulp.</p>
<p id="line_1040">With all of that talk about withholding wages, she seemed to be worried that her share was gone too.</p>
<p id="line_1041">I was a man of my word; such worries were uncalled for. So, I signaled to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with a glance. In response, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> grinned and nodded vigorously, followed by a pompous announcement, “You may have high expectations! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mark" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> my words, we will pay you handsomely.”</p>
<p id="line_1042">Ramiris wore a broad grin on her face after hearing that.</p>
<p id="line_1043">“So, it’s finally here.”</p>
<p id="line_1044">“Hmm? What is?”</p>
<p id="line_1045">“The time, the age! My era has finally come!”</p>
<p id="line_1046"><em>I wonder</em>. <em>I don’t think such an era has come.</em></p>
<p id="line_1047">Ramiris laughed with a shrill voice while saying that. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came by to bring her tea and had the same joyful expression… She seemed a bit overprotective and heavy on the love…but that wasn’t any of my business.</p>
<p id="line_1048">“Speaking of paychecks, don’t I get one too?”</p>
<p id="line_1049">Annoyingly enough, Veldora had also awoken an interest in money. I figured this was the time to pay up. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> glanced at me, and I returned a slight nod.</p>
<p id="line_1050">“Of course, we have it prepared. Would you agree to receive the same amount as Ramiris-sama?”</p>
<p id="line_1051">As a matter of fact, I had already discussed this with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. After all, Veldora was employed as the king of this labyrinth. It may have looked like he wasn’t doing anything, but we were actually relying on Veldora’s leaking magicules to maintain the environment of the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_1052">Turning iron ore into magisteel alone already drove major profits. So, I didn’t want to be stingy and thought that it would be right to properly compensate them.</p>
<p id="line_1053">“Oh, ohhh! Is that so? As expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I can feel relieved knowing you’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p id="line_1054">“Don’t waste it on unnecessary things.”</p>
<p id="line_1055">“Uh, of course not!”</p>
<p id="line_1056">“Of, of course! I know what saving is, too!”</p>
<p id="line_1057">Knowing something didn’t mean much if you didn’t put it into action. That’s what I thought, but I didn’t want to rain on their parade.</p>
<p id="line_1058">“Hahaha, no harm in spending some. You gotta feel the joy of spending it first to appreciate the effort of saving it.”</p>
<p id="line_1059">“Right?! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan, you know that well!”</p>
<p id="line_1060"><em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, if you pamper Ramiris she will get carried away. I’d hope you see <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san as a bad example and learn from it.</em></p>
<p id="line_1061">“What of it? I also have experience working at the takoyaki shop. I understand the value of working and the importance of money. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you worry too much!”</p>
<p id="line_1062"><em>What’s with your smug attitude? It was me who set up the takoyaki shop, and it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who actually did the work. You were just frying takoyaki!</em></p>
<p id="line_1063">I would have liked to lash out, but I got a grip.</p>
<p id="line_1064">Well, you live and you learn. Let the two of them do as they wish. Even if they failed, they could learn something from it, and that’s okay.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1065">I knew that the town was flourishing, but I wondered what the internal situation was really like. I was concerned about that, so I decided to pose the question, “By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, how are things going outside the labyrinth?”</p>
<p id="line_1066"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s face lit up.</p>
<p id="line_1067">“It’s lively—that one word says it all. The festival has already ended but I don’t see a big change in the population. It is safe to assume that the merchants are now on a steady stream.”</p>
<p id="line_1068">“In other words, does that mean that this town has started to become a trading hub?”</p>
<p id="line_1069">“That’s right. The merchants looking to do business have begun to pay me visits. Not all of them were coming through connections, so Rigurd-dono seems to have been busy handling correspondences. Ranging from those affiliated with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to wealthy merchants in Western countries, inquiries about opening a shop have been stacking up.”</p>
<p id="line_1070">That seemed to be going more smoothly than I had thought. We succeeded in bringing people over with the Tempest Debut Festival as the spark. On top of that, the labyrinth that we created for fun enjoyed surging popularity and was able to win the hearts and minds of visitors.</p>
<p id="line_1071">All that’s left was to direct the money into a smooth flow.</p>
<p id="line_1072">We let those who challenged the labyrinth earn money and consume our country’s goods. Products included not only lodging and meals but also weapons, armor, and supplies. Naturally, merchants from other countries would also play a part there. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would buy up the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> materials and pour money back into our country. Merchants from foreign lands would bring various kinds of rare goods. By the time that happened, the town would be bustling with activity.</p>
<p id="line_1073">In the meantime, our country would earn a reputation for the excellent products made here. We had a wide selection of local specialties to offer, many of them were culinary ingredients and alcohol, along with the countless dishes <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> developed with them. There were also various kinds of weapons and armor made in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workshop. Now that several of Kaijin’s disciples were working together, a variety of products were available. There were many other things too, but I was sure there would be more yet to come.</p>
<p id="line_1074">It spread by word of mouth, and even without putting much effort into advertising the product, customers would surely come. And as a result, this country was bound to become recognized and required by many.</p>
<p id="line_1075">But wait, there’s more.</p>
<p id="line_1076">Some of the gear that came from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workshop was displayed in markets as this city’s specialty product. The armaments traded there would also attract a lot of attention. They were sold by different shops depending on the quality, but high-performance equipment could be bought if you had the right amount of cash. Though, when it came to rare-grade and above equipment, I only planned to exhibit it on the ninety-fifth floor of the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_1077">Some might question its performance, but that wasn’t a big deal. After all, there was a place close by where you could try out the products you bought. There were still only a handful of people using this service, but we did offer rental gear for challengers as well. And it would only be a matter of time before news of how great the quality of the products was, would spread on its own.</p>
<p id="line_1078">And so, little by little, the trust in this country piled up.</p>
<p id="line_1079">Credibility was more important than profit. I didn’t think that we had to run a deficit to gain credibility, but if we are in the black overall, we could call it a success. Our goal was not to make money, but to get this country recognized on the world stage.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1080">“It is as we expected. The merchants still approach us in spite of Tempest being a kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, because they can smell the profits. The number of challengers continues to grow, and it seems we have an opportunity to get along with the Western Nations.”</p>
<p id="line_1081">Accepting my wishes, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded as well.</p>
<p id="line_1082">“There doesn’t seem to be a problem. The number of customers is increasing steadily. This is with the knowledge that this is a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> country ruled by a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We can safely assume that we’ve gained credibility, just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama intended,” he agreed emphatically.</p>
<p id="line_1083">Besides, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a really interesting man.</p>
<p id="line_1084"><em>“We,” huh?</em> From that statement, you could tell that even though he was a human, his thought process was entirely from our perspective.</p>
<p id="line_1085"><em>That does put a smile on my face.</em></p>
<p id="line_1086">Credibility is not something you can earn at the drop of a hat. As they say, trust is a fragile thing—hard to gain but easy to lose. Few words were truer than that.</p>
<p id="line_1087">Although we attracted people by stimulating their desires, it was another matter to gain their trust. If they regarded us as someone who satisfied their desires, that meant you had gained their trust.</p>
<p id="line_1088"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is a good example, we were bound by a trusting relationship built upon desire.</p>
<p id="line_1089">Do a good job and reap the proper benefits—I believed this to be important.</p>
<p id="line_1090">Of course, pursuing your desires one-sidedly is an unpleasant way to go about it. You must look deeply into a person’s character to gauge if they’re worthy of trust. This was the perfect time to hone that very skill.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1092">After that, I gave Ramiris and Veldora their pay; the two of them looked happy. I <em>did</em> tell them not to waste it, <em>but do they even think about what they’re buying?</em></p>
<p id="line_1093">Despite these doubts, the discussion carried on.</p>
<p id="line_1094">Now that the labyrinth was on track, I was thinking about devoting myself to the things I loved.</p>
<p id="line_1095">The research facility, which was newly prepared on the one-hundredth floor, was divided into several compartments. At present we had laboratories headed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and facilities where Ramiris conducted her personal research.</p>
<p id="line_1096">“Um, could you prepare a facility for me as well?”</p>
<p id="line_1097">“Fine, but are you going to do some research as well, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_1098">“No, in my case, it’s development. I’ve got a lot of things on my mind, so I thought I’d make them.”</p>
<p id="line_1099">When it came to research, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was working much more diligently than I was. His workshop was located in the southwest part of the city, and the surrounding area was lined with the workshops of disciples who were recognized as master craftsmen.</p>
<p id="line_1100">It was said that some artisans who heard the rumors had taken up residence there, and some even opened their own workshops. These people were also repairing equipment, and now it was a kind of industrial area.</p>
<p id="line_1101">Therefore, the technology developed there was nigh impossible to hide. This was a place where everyone could share and learn from each other in a friendly competition—that was no place to conduct confidential research and development.</p>
<p id="line_1102">What I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was to make armor and technical stuff, which no one else could feasibly imitate.</p>
<p id="line_1103">Besides, I didn’t need the space to do any research, all thanks to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei. That’s why I wanted a place to set up the development, based on the diagrams I had completed in my brain.</p>
<p id="line_1104">“Okay! I’ll have it ready for you today!” Ramiris readily agreed to my request.</p>
<p id="line_1105">And with that, the lowest floor, the one-hundredth floor underground, the one that began as the great hall of Veldora, became a large space with various research facilities.</p>
<p id="line_1106">Viewing it from the perspective of defense as well as leak prevention, there was no other place that guaranteed this level of security. It was truly impregnable.</p>
<p id="line_1107">From now on, important projects would be carried out in this location.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1108">“So, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, just what are you trying to make?”</p>
<p id="line_1109">“It’s a secret.”</p>
<p id="line_1110">“What? You always make the strangest things, so I’m quite curious.”</p>
<p id="line_1111">“That’s right. There should be no secrets between you and me!”</p>
<p id="line_1112"><em>What nonsense… Ramiris and Veldora are always up to something behind my back. But when it comes to this, these two are persistent.</em></p>
<p id="line_1113">Deceiving them was even more of a hassle, so I decided to give them a proper answer.</p>
<p id="line_1114">“It’s about bodies. I’m planning to make one for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s sisters to use.”</p>
<p id="line_1115">In truth, I was thinking about preparing the quantity <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had requested as well. When it came to amounts around one thousand, making them by hand would’ve been a herculean task. With this in mind, I wanted a facility capable of mass production.</p>
<p id="line_1116">“Make it big; I have quite a lot of things I want to try out.”</p>
<p id="line_1117">“Okay. Since it’s for <em>my subordinate</em>, I’ll do what I can to help!”</p>
<p id="line_1118">Putting an emphasis on the subordinate part, Ramiris accepted my request.</p>
<p id="line_1119"><em>Hee hee, it was right to only give half of the truth. With this, I’ll be able to experiment to my heart’s content.</em></p>
<p id="line_1120">Until now, the idea was just floating in my head, without the spare time to make it happen. Finally, I could dive into developing it. I grinned at the thought.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1121">A couple more days passed.</p>
<p id="line_1122">I was engrossed in installing the equipment for the development.

<p id="line_1123">If these had been bits of technology that were meant to be passed on to future generations, I would never have done things the way I did. But I didn’t intend to share this tech with the public in the first place, so I didn’t restrain myself and created whatever I wanted.</p>
<p id="line_1124">It was then that someone called for me from outside.</p>
<p id="line_1125"><em>And just when I thought that I was beginning to be productive</em>—</p>

<p id="line_1132">They really <em>were</em> worrying about me.</p>

<p id="line_1140"><em>I suppose. I really need to stop getting carried away with my interests.</em> But merely knowing that someone was worried about me cheered me up.</p>

<p id="line_1155">“There have been other people who made it through Floor 30, after <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>

<p id="line_1158"><em>Woah, wow-wow.</em> Indeed, now wasn’t the time for chilling. But I didn’t think such panic was warranted.</p>

<p id="line_1160">And so on and so forth, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> continued without pause.</p>

<p id="line_1163">……</p>
<p id="line_1164">…</p>
<p id="line_1165">It looked like these people were good at using Ramiris’s items.</p>
<p id="line_1166">First, before they went to fight the guardian of Floor 20, they used a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Recording Crystal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This item applied to a full squad, so even if they were wiped out, they could still respawn at the save point that they registered.</p>
<p id="line_1167">All of those item uses were in line with my expectations. This on its own was fine, but, on top of that, they were also using a ‘Return Whistle’ to leave the labyrinth as a squad. Following that, they would disband the squad and then each member would find additional teammates to form a new squad, with a maximum number of ten members.</p>
<p id="line_1168">“Let’s see, this way the total number would be—”</p>
<p id="line_1169">“Indeed. These are no longer just a couple squads, their size is more comparable to a small army.”</p>
<p id="line_1170">With ten squads in total, that added up to one hundred challengers. Every single one of them boasted a strength of at least rank C-plus to B-plus. I heard that they were also wearing the same type of jacket embroidered with some sort of symbol. All of these people grouped together in style. Almost as if they were trying to show everyone else how “strong” they were, they marched onward through the labyrinth. And of course, it was said that all members had appeared before the guardian of Floor 30. These challengers were also divided into squads, ten in total, each of them taking turns.</p>
<p id="line_1171">The ogre lord and his five subordinates were a powerful company, but those challengers weren’t rookies either. And in the end, even though it was a tough battle, these people still made it through Floor 30 with their third squad of challengers.</p>
<p id="line_1172">………</p>
<p id="line_1173">……</p>

<p id="line_1240">“That was fast, so he really couldn’t handle it…?”</p>
<p id="line_1241">Ignoring Veldora’s usual demeanor, Ramiris was gazing at me with doubt in her eyes. Although she had good reason to do so, I was slightly offended, and, therefore, declared my discovery with a slice of arrogance: “That guy looks to be above rank A.”</p>
<p id="line_1242">I presented footage that was quite unlike the feed displayed by Ramiris and continued to enlarge the images.</p>
<p id="line_1243">“EH!” Everyone seemed surprised, but Ramiris was the one that was hit the hardest.</p>
<p id="line_1244">“H-hold up, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?

<p id="line_1245">“Hahaha, after you gave me access to interfere, I just suddenly learned how to use it.”</p>
<p id="line_1246">“No way! Even I can only broadcast specific locations and people that I’ve checked on before…”</p>
<p id="line_1247">Apparently, Ramiris could only project images that the labyrinth managers could see. No wonder why it was difficult to verify intelligence in detail.</p>
<p id="line_1248">“Ahh, don’t be a stranger. I’m just good at this type of thing.”</p>
<p id="line_1249">While pacifying Ramiris by saying that, I turned my eyes to the projector.</p>
<p id="line_1250">Speaking of the person above rank A, he was the captain of the team <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, a spirit-wielder. Given how much power he had been hiding, surely, he would be able to utilize many spirits.

<p id="line_1251">“Oh, so the ‘above rank A’ you said was in comparison to the ranking of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_1252">“Yep, that’s the standard set by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in order to determine which people of a certain rank can defeat what type of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1253">Yet they never considered the relative safety of such a battle.

<p id="line_1254">“Then what rank is my team?”</p>

<p id="line_1257">Right now, it was best to try and make something up.</p>
<p id="line_1258">“Jinrai barely made it to rank A. Although I’m unsure whether he could defeat the tempest serpent alone, it should be a piece of cake if he had the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> series.”</p>

This was, of course, no video game; the possession of resistance could be a matter of life and death. Despite being on equal footing in terms of strength, one can easily succumb to a lethal dose of poison.</p>
<p id="line_1260">“Jinrai sure is impressive.”</p>
<p id="line_1261">“Isn’t he? However, a lot of that is due to your Skill buffing Jinrai’s abilities through the roof.

<p id="line_1281">I thought those two would have been happier, were they worrying about something? I was pretty pissed by the fact that my own traps were getting thwarted, but, by all accounts, these two should’ve been looking forward to challengers. Moreover, since a short while ago, Ramiris’s face had been filled with panic; were they hiding something from me?</p>
<p id="line_1282">“Is there something you aren’t telling me?” I asked straight up.</p>
<p id="line_1283">And soon, Veldora and Ramiris turned to look at each other, before Ramiris seemingly decided to be straight with me and began to talk.</p>
<p id="line_1284">“The thing is, during the three days you stayed in your room…”</p>

<p id="line_1300">And here I thought that the difficulty had been set too high… It seemed that any squads of soldiers above rank A could recover as long as one of them was left standing. Now we really had to re-evaluate and re-adjust the difficulty.</p>

<p id="line_1302"><em>Very impressive.</em> It was able to take out all of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s; it packed one hell of a punch.

<p id="line_1347"><em>Phew, this will do. It’s all because you let it go straight to your head when anyone praises you.</em></p>
<p id="line_1348">“So, what’s your conclusion?”</p>
<p id="line_1349"><em>First, it’s time to hear what Veldora has to say.</em> Having made up my mind, I turned to Veldora. He nodded with an “Umm” before continuing his speech.</p>
<p id="line_1350">“So, yeah, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who managed to seal me didn’t throw out any unnecessary attacks. By contrast, this woman called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tried out a series of different attacks to see which ones would be effective against me. That being said, she was just as calm and cautious, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did heaps of unnecessary stuff.”</p>
<p id="line_1351">According to Veldora, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tried out a variety of attacks. She utilized all sorts of magic, spells, magic tools, and even magic artifacts. No expense was spared in their battle. Any purely physical attacks were ineffective against Veldora. That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> probably ran a number of tests to see which attacks had an impact. But in the end, none of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s attacks amounted to much of anything.</p>
<p id="line_1352">“By the way, her last attack was pretty good. For just a moment, she managed to hurt me. It was something similar to the ‘Absolute Severance’ of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1353">What Veldora was praising was probably her ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Melt Slash" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ I figured that it was likely <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s trump card. She even went so far as to sacrifice her moonlight rapier in order to execute this deadly attack. Yet, even so, she still couldn’t hurt Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_1354">“Considering her fighting style, will she pose a threat?”</p>
<p id="line_1355">“Uh—it’s certain that she’s stronger than Clayman and the other poser <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. Even members of the Octagram may find themselves in danger, should they be careless. But Mentor is something else—”</p>
<p id="line_1356">“GAHAHA, of course! She’ll need at least ten times more magicules to even stand a chance against me.”</p>
<p id="line_1357"><em>I see…</em> Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was outmatched by Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_1358"><em>Aaah, how I would’ve loved to have seen that fight. It would’ve been useful for future reference, had it been recorded permanently. Never mind, it’s too late for that now</em>. <em>Let the past rest, it’s time to get back on track.</em></p>
<p id="line_1359">“I get it. In other words, because of the whole ordeal with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, all the floors below fifty-one are now out of commission? But hey, wouldn’t the guardian have revived, nonetheless?”</p>
<p id="line_1360">“About that, wasn’t <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weaker than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? He helps me out with research, and I think he’s outstanding and all, but as the guardian of the sixtieth floor, he’s not exactly dependable. Besides…”</p>
<p id="line_1361">At this point, Ramiris began to tremble—</p>
<p id="line_1362">“M-my masterpiece, the Elemental Colossus…was broken… It didn’t revive!”</p>
<p id="line_1363">She broke down into tears as she finished.</p>
<p id="line_1364"><em>Wasn’t it a guardian as well?</em></p>
<p id="line_1365">“Did you forget to equip it with a bracelet or something?”</p>
<p id="line_1366">“N-no, it was the same when you destroyed it,” Ramiris said in a huff. “For some reason, golems just won’t revive…”</p>
<p id="line_1367">I heard that it was possible to revive naturally spawning golems, but the ones created by Ramiris would not. Hearing that made me think of something.</p>
<p id="line_1368">“Perhaps it had to do with the lack of a soul. After all, Beretta can be revived. Is it possible that the Elemental Colossus was considered to be an item?”</p>
<p id="line_1369">“—Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_1370">“Um, that’s very likely. Ramiris, could the reason why your Skill did not apply be that the Colossus was outside its effect?”</p>
<p id="line_1371">Veldora added in agreement, so I was probably right. In other words, even if she were to make another one, there’s still a chance that it would get broken again. The Elemental Colossus was strong though, so it was unlikely for it to get destroyed often. That said, we still needed to figure something out. But before that—</p>
<p id="line_1372">“It takes a long time to make that thing, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_1373">“Yeah…that’s why there’s no guardian on Floor 70…”</p>
<p id="line_1374">Of course.</p>
<p id="line_1375">“Also, Zegion, on Floor 80, will need to sleep for a bit longer. Apito has grown stronger as well, but her combat experience is lacking. If she is planning to be a guardian, I think she will need more training.”</p>
<p id="line_1376">According to Veldora, he seemed to have given Apito some combat training. <em>So, he’s heading in that direction?</em> Although I personally had doubts concerning the matter, because Veldora seemed highly motivated, I’d let them have their way.</p>
<p id="line_1377">By the way, her instructor was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Apparently, using the rematch with Veldora as bait, he had asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to mentor Apito. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was already tutoring the kids, she must’ve been willing to instruct Apito as well.</p>
<p id="line_1378">There was also Kumara. Floors 81 through 89 were guarded by Kumara’s subordinates. Those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s were all generated using Kumara’s tails, each of them possessed free will and could evolve and learn independently. Due to the release of all her subordinates, Kumara’s own magicule content decreased drastically. She, alongside Chloe, Alice, and the others, would be studying under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1379">—As of yesterday, that’s what had been decided.</p>
<p id="line_1380">“In other words, we have no real guardians from Floors 60 to 90 right now?”</p>
<p id="line_1381">“Yes!”</p>
<p id="line_1382">“Um, that’s why we were troubled!”</p>
<p id="line_1383">For some reason, Ramiris and Veldora both looked rather smug.</p>
<p id="line_1384">“W-what…”</p>
<p id="line_1385">“The timing is just horrible.”</p>
<p id="line_1386"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were both shocked by the current state of affairs within the labyrinth. <em>And I thought that there was room for slacks</em>—looks like I was too naive once again.</p>
<p id="line_1387">“…I got the gist of things,” I sighed, feeling rather powerless.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1388">This was the perfect storm of bad news. But on the bright side, we were able to identify the issues of the floors below fifty-one. Moreover, all the traps I laid were still there. Our focus should be on the floors below forty-one, or rather, focus on floors below forty-nine.</p>
<p id="line_1389">“It’s just a matter of time before the tempest serpent gets beaten. But we don’t need to worry!”</p>
<p id="line_1390">“Oh oh, as expected from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Have you already come up with a solution?”</p>
<p id="line_1391">“I see. We don’t have to worry as long as you’re around!”</p>
<p id="line_1392">Hearing my words, Veldora and Ramiris’s distress seemed to have vanished.</p>
<p id="line_1393">I nodded to the two snobs and expressed my ideas, “Listen carefully now. As I’ve just said, I’ve put all the kick-ass traps below Floor 41. Those intruders will have a bad time.”</p>
<p id="line_1394">“Oh oh…that sounds so reassuring.”</p>
<p id="line_1395">“Ho—I see, I see.”</p>
<p id="line_1396">“By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, what kinds of traps did you plant there?”</p>
<p id="line_1397"><em>Hehe, you wanna know? I’ll tell you then.</em></p>
<p id="line_1398">“The ultimate trap I had prepared on Floor 49 is slime. After passing into certain hallways, there is a mechanism to isolate people. And that’s when a bunch of slimes will appear. Those fellows are a pain in the ass to deal with.”</p>
<p id="line_1399">A large amount of slime would gush forth and coalesce, forming a giant slime that was over three meters thick. The path forward, as well as backward, would be blocked, trapping the challengers like fish in a barrel. None of the physical attacks, neither slashing, beating, nor ramming would work on the slimes.</p>
<p id="line_1400">In a tightly sealed hallway, the magic at their disposal would be limited as well. Explosive spells were out of the question because they would probably just end up blowing themselves up.</p>
<p id="line_1401">Although individual slimes posed no threat, they would all slowly move in to attack. And considering that the challengers would be cornered, this started to shape up as a significant threat.</p>
<p id="line_1402">“GAHAHAHA! Now we definitely will win!”</p>
<p id="line_1403">“Uh-huh, it’s our win for sure—!”</p>
<p id="line_1404">“You two are so naive. I’ve got many other tricks lined up as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1405">It was too early to get excited about the concept of my traps alone. There were still a ton of other traps to go over. Hear all about them and shiver in fear!</p>
<ul>
<li><p id="line_1406">Slime Pool: Although it appears to be a soft-feeling passage at first glance, it is actually a slime. About halfway through, it’ll suddenly show its true colors.</p></li>
<li><p id="line_1407">Slime Rain: Fist-sized slimes rain down from above. They will also try to sneak into the openings in your clothes. Watch out for their acidic burn.</p></li>
<li><p id="line_1408">Slime Doll: At first glance it looks like a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But it won’t get tired after sustaining consecutive attacks from its enemies. It will slowly exhaust the opponents’ stamina. The more terrifying aspect of it, is that it will splatter strong acid on the enemies’ weapons every time it is attacked. Watch out for your weapons’ durability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1409">And so on and so forth.</p>
<p id="line_1410">There were other traps as well, but all of them were installed with the intent of staggering the enemies—especially the ones aimed at destroying challengers’ weapons. <em>Surely, it would be difficult for them to continue fighting after that.</em></p>
<p id="line_1411">At the very least it could help us buy some time.</p>
<p id="line_1412">“Amazing. Those traps sounded amazing. So, you were saying that we don’t need to rely on the traps to take out the enemies directly, but instead only harming them slightly?”</p>
<p id="line_1413">“That’s the idea, Veldora.”</p>
<p id="line_1414">“I see. Without weapons, no matter how strong they are, they will probably be intimidated. That’s when we can break them.”</p>
<p id="line_1415">“Yeah. It’s best to just defeat them straight away, but we can figure out something else if that doesn’t work. Right now, we can at least get some more time.”</p>
<p id="line_1416">It looked like this time my traps’ only purpose was to stall for time. Although that was a bit disappointing, we can use the time we earned to think of a countermeasure.</p>
<p id="line_1417">“Then what will you do with the extra time you’ve got?”</p>
<p id="line_1418">Since Veldora asked, I decided to answer seriously.</p>
<p id="line_1419">“What we should not forget is that our labyrinth is different from the normal one. An advanced labyrinth should be strengthened by overcoming various problems, shouldn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_1420">“—UH!”</p>
<p id="line_1421">“Hmm, of course we should.”</p>
<p id="line_1422">“Then we just need to improve until we can handle the challengers next time. First, we need to deal with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I’ll figure something out for him. I also want to change the environment on the boss floors, for which I’ll need Ramiris’s help.”</p>
<p id="line_1423">“Okay!”</p>
<p id="line_1424"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a cardinal, if I recalled correctly, his role was the archbishop. Strictly speaking, he was supposed to be the support type. It was a mistake to let him be the guardian alone, what we should’ve done was finding him a partner to act as the vanguard. Besides, I had some ideas of my own. I’d find <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Ramiris later.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1425">Next was the guardian on floor seventy.</p>
<p id="line_1426">“Regarding the Elemental Colossus, we have no choice but to make a new one. Luckily, it just so happens that the perfect man for the job has returned.”</p>
<p id="line_1427">I had prepared the materials and planned to rebuild it. But it would’ve been boring to make the same colossus as last time.</p>
<p id="line_1428">“The perfect man?” Ramiris asked with doubt in her voice, to which I nodded in return.</p>
<p id="line_1429">“Kaijin is back. That guy has a hand for spirit engineering; he would be happy to help. Moreover, the experiment that I’ve been running might also be of help, so I’ll be handing over my research results. You can look forward to the new and improved version of the colossus.”</p>
<p id="line_1430">“—Really? That’s wonderful!”</p>
<p id="line_1431">Even though he won’t be able to produce the outcome immediately, Kaijin would definitely prove to be a big help. Even in the event that we didn’t have enough time to finish it this time, its completion would, nonetheless, be a threat to future challengers.</p>
<p id="line_1432">“And regarding Floors 80 and below—”</p>
<p id="line_1433">“I think the problems will resolve themselves with enough time. When Zegion awakes, none of the amateur challengers will be able to hurt him. There are also the dragons prepared by Milim, they will probably evolve after staying in the labyrinth for a while.”</p>
<p id="line_1434">Kumara was still growing as well, so there was no need to panic.</p>
<p id="line_1435">One question remained: how much extra time could we salvage?</p>
<p id="line_1436">“Okay, our plan is settled. All we need to do now, is to buy ourselves time. We can’t simply rely on my traps alone. There’s one thing I want to try out, and I’ll need Veldora and Ramiris’s help for that.”</p>
<p id="line_1437">“Of course.“ “I got it!” the two of them agreed happily.</p>
<p id="line_1438">I nodded and turned to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

Your secondary objective is to break through Floors 41 and below, but right now you’d best try to collect a complete <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-set.”</p>

We don’t have to rush things.”</p>
<p id="line_1441">“Then we should just allow the others to break through Floor 40 first.”</p>
<p id="line_1442">“Yeah. On the contrary, you may as well stay away for the time being, lest you get caught up in our operation.”</p>
<p id="line_1443">“You’re up to something again, aren’t you?”</p>

That really hurt my feelings. It’s as if I was always up to no good.</p>
<p id="line_1445">“Ahh, that’s a secret. In any case, we will be taking measures accordingly from now on.

<p id="line_1446">“I understand.”</p>
<p id="line_1447">“Got it, I’ll tell everyone else later.”</p>
<p id="line_1448"><em>This should do. Let’s see just how long my traps can last.</em></p>
<p id="line_1449">“Then that’s about—”</p>
<p id="line_1450">“Ah, please hold on one moment, I have something to discuss with your Majesty…”</p>

<p id="line_1456">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_1457">I couldn’t help but gasp. The prize she mentioned was the bait we set for the nobles. We claimed that prizes would be given to people that manage to break through every tenth floor.</p>

<p id="line_1509">“It’s more important that you now are aware of the extent of your strength. Since you’ve learned that now, I have a question for you, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p id="line_1510">“Please, do ask.”</p>
<p id="line_1511">“To what extent can you use ‘Holy Magic’?”</p>
<p id="line_1512">‘Holy Magic’ was the power of faith. It didn’t require you to concentrate the magicule in the air, nor was it bound by the amount of magicule you yourself possessed. Aside from requiring more preparation, as long as you possessed the knowledge and sufficient time to chant, you could cast grand spells at little cost to yourself.</p>
<p id="line_1513">However, the usage of ‘Holy Magic’ was limited to those who ‘Have formed a pact with God.’ The “God,” in this sense, referred to people who could manipulate ‘Spirit Particles,’ the special particles that magicules consisted of<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The term “magicule” may invoke the idea of a molecule, however, it actually refers to an element." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. In this world, it was irrelevant whether a being became a “God” conceptually. Those who could interfere with ‘Spirit Particles’ directly, could be considered a “God.” For instance, within the religion of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the “God.”</p>

Even after becoming a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, his faith was not shaken. That’s why, even after becoming a wight king, he retained the ability to cast ‘Disintegration.’</p>
<p id="line_1515">But as he lost faith in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he instead turned towards worshipping me as his God. Perhaps now that the ‘pact with god’ no longer applied, that must’ve been why he couldn’t use ‘Holy Magic’ any longer.</p>
<p id="line_1516">“Yes, I have become incapable of using nearly all of my magic. As it stands, even the use of lesser magic spells escapes me.”</p>
<p id="line_1517"><em>I see.</em> ‘Holy Magic,’ at the end of the day, was in the same vein as ‘Spirit Magic.’ It depended on a pact of some sort as the user borrowed strength from a being of higher power.</p>
<p id="line_1518">The same applied to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_1527">The most important element in casting ‘Holy Magic’ was faith.

<p id="line_1547">“OHOH, GOD, MY GOD, RIMURU-SAMA—”</p>
<p id="line_1548">He fell to the ground and began to worship me.</p>
<p id="line_1549"><em>That’s pretty spooky, please stop.</em></p>
<p id="line_1550">“A-alrighty. Looks like it was a success? Let’s keep up the good work. Go and learn some more advanced magic, and if there’s a problem, just go ask <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!” I uttered in a hurry. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> understood and nodded lightly.</p>

<p id="line_1553">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I will not betray your expectations—!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> proclaimed in high spirits. I then decided to ask him another important question, “By the way, didn’t you hurt yourself by using Holy Magic, considering you’re a wight?”</p>
<p id="line_1554">Holy Magic could be divided into two types: first, to manipulate ‘Spirit Particles,’ which had no elemental affinity, and second, to utilize the holy element to eliminate magicule.</p>
<p id="line_1555">Holy Cannon fell under the latter category, so I thought that it would have harmed an undead <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1556">“Hahaha, it did hurt a bit, but it was nothing serious—”</p>
<p id="line_1557"><em>I see. </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s sturdy backbone let him tough it out. But that didn’t really solve the issue. If he were to have Beretta’s Unique Skill ‘Reverser,’ he could probably convert holy and demonic elements<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="To clarify, the demonic element actually refers to magicule, because only monsters possess magicule (humans use mana), and the holy element is the counterpart to all monsters." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>… That would have to depend on the outcome of future research.</p>
<p id="line_1558">In any case, he should switch up his ability for this occasion.</p>
<p id="line_1559">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, can you manage this?”</p>
<p id="line_1560">I jumped out of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s arms and cast a ray of light in the air.</p>
<p id="line_1561">“OHOH!”</p>
<p id="line_1562">“I excluded all the holy elements and tried to elevate the power further. This is an original spell of mine, Holy Magic ‘Holy Ray.”’</p>
<p id="line_1563">‘Holy Ray’ was a magic spell that didn’t have any element affinity. If he were to switch to using this, as long as he cast it correctly, the caster shouldn’t be affected. However, this move was pretty difficult to perform—it would mean that he had to put even more faith into me…</p>
<p id="line_1564">Even though this was magic designed to tackle single opponents, its power was greater than my ‘Megiddo.’ It could be fired in rapid succession at an almost blinding luminosity. So, it would appear to be like a flash of light, when, in reality, they were, in fact, small, rotating ‘Spirit Particles.’ It was an attack that pierced the enemy, making it less deadly than ‘Disintegration,’ in turn the time required for chanting was also reduced.</p>
<p id="line_1565">“Amazing, this magic is amazing!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was overjoyed.</p>
<p id="line_1566">If he could master this spell, he should also be able to get used to manipulating ‘Spirit Particles.’ When that time came, he would be able to blast even thicker beams of light and greatly enhance their power.</p>
<p id="line_1567">This was one of the magic spells that I requested <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei to develop.

<p id="line_1570">“Then, please work hard to practice from now on and master the ‘Holy Magic’ that won’t harm you.”</p>
<p id="line_1571">I sure hoped that he would put in the extra effort every day, so that he wouldn’t end up as a pile of bones after every fight—that was my rationale behind those words of encouragement.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1572"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was dancing with glee, but I got him to calm down with a gesture, before moving on to the next problem.</p>
<p id="line_1573">“Next, as it stands, your means of attack are still few and far between. You can gradually increase them in the future, but before that, something needs to be done first.”</p>
<p id="line_1574">“And that is?”</p>
<p id="line_1575">“Weren’t you originally a rearguard?”</p>
<p id="line_1576">“If I had to put it in words, I suppose I mostly offered rear support for the army. When I was still a wight king, I used summoning magic to raise the undead army and win by sheer numbers.”</p>
<p id="line_1577">I suspected as much. Since there were no such rules that limited the number of floor guardians to one, it was just a matter of finding him a vanguard, and fast.</p>
<p id="line_1578">“I see. So, it was a mistake to set you up against an entire team by yourself.”</p>
<p id="line_1579">“I’m something of a martial artist myself, but, as a skeleton, it’s not very effective…”</p>
<p id="line_1580"><em>That’s hardly the problem.</em> This wasn’t about his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat, though I think he mistook it as personal criticism.</p>
<p id="line_1581">“No no no, don’t be so self-conscious now. It’s fine when there’s only one opponent, but when they come in a group, you have all the right to summon companions. Didn’t you have a companion? His name was—”</p>

<p id="line_1584">“He is an outstanding man, surely, he will be able to live up to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s expectations.”</p>

<p id="line_1586">“If that’s the case, please hand this gear to him later.”</p>
<p id="line_1587">I took all sorts of equipment out of my ‘Stomach’ and laid them on the ground.

<p class="space-break" id="line_1588">Cursed Sword—A bastard sword that absorbed life force from the surroundings and converted it into attack power. However, it also absorbed the life force of the user. It was a complete failure.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1589">Cursed Mail—It maintained a magic barrier that greatly raised endurance and defense against magic. However, it was, once again, a failure that absorbed the life force of the user.</p>

Nowadays this has become a fun tale. Nevertheless, the works they made were filled with memories, and they couldn’t just throw them away.

<p id="line_1593">“How about them? Do you feel any worse once putting them on?”</p>
<p id="line_1594">“We are already dead, so we don’t really feel anything in particular.”</p>

<p id="line_1629">“Is it really okay?”</p>
<p id="line_1630">“Um—at least he would perform better than yesterday, and the days before that. However, he may still have a hard time against rank A opponents, but he should be able to force his opponent into revealing all their cards.”</p>
<p id="line_1631">If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were to be persistent in his pursuit, surely the enemies would be forced to show their true strength. If that were to be the case, it would be time for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san to shine.

<p id="line_1632">All we needed to do was to apply said strategy on the next floor.

<p id="line_1633">It was better if we had multiple strategies.</p>
<p id="line_1634">And so, we had to put them into action immediately—</p>
<p id="line_1635">“What the heck have you all been doing! I’ve heard the news; did someone beat my dragons!”</p>
<p id="line_1636">Trouble had arrived. Milim burst into the meeting room as she roared in a furious tone.

He probably got whipped into shape pretty hard by Milim and was utterly exhausted.</p>
<p id="line_1639">In spite of this, he didn’t look any stronger. Although, he <em>did</em> look like he’d been through hell, was he all right?</p>
<p id="line_1640">Ignoring my concern, Milim nodded heavily.</p>
<p id="line_1641">“Yeah. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was great!

<p id="line_1642">For Milim, of all people, to be praising him, said a lot; surely, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had achieved some goals.</p>

<p id="line_1647">The best thing for him now was to get some good rest.

<p id="line_1648">Ranga also made it back.</p>
<p id="line_1649">“M-master, I have returned,” Ranga said, evidently exhausted.</p>
<p id="line_1650">He stumbled as he slowly made his way over to me. Ranga’s body was covered in scars just like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_1652">“You worked hard, now rest up in my shadow.”</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1661">Well then, since Milim had come, that proved to make things significantly easier from here on out.</p>
<p id="line_1662">I had been busy making preparations after I bid <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Adalmann" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> farewell last night. And, as it turned out, I managed to finish it on time.</p>
<p id="line_1663">I took out the items I had just completed. Veldora, Ramiris, Milim; all three of them were transfixed by the items in my hands, gazing at them with intrigue.</p>
<p id="line_1664">“Everyone, check this out! I have some special items here. I’ve been working on it for a while, and it’s gonna be revolutionary. It’ll help resolve all the problems in the labyrinth <em>and</em> introduce a whole new level of fun into our lives!”</p>
<p id="line_1665">As I finished, I handed each of them one of the items.</p>
<p id="line_1666">I didn’t expect Milim to come today, but in truth, I was going to call her when this item was put to practice. So, it all worked out, I had already prepared one for Milim.</p>
<p id="line_1667">I was inspired by the homunculus used by Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the past.</p>
<p id="line_1668">Since we could replace our bodies temporarily, this opened the door for many fun opportunities.</p>
<p id="line_1669">“What is this?”</p>
<p id="line_1670">“I’ve never seen this before; can you eat it?”</p>
<p id="line_1671">“Hmm, in my opinion, this is something similar to a soul container.”</p>
<p id="line_1672">The three expressed their views.</p>
<p id="line_1673"><em>Give up already, Ramiris, you can’t eat this. Does she think that everything I prepare is food…? Oh well, never mind.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1674">Veldora’s answer was the closest. It was indeed something made to emulate a soul container. The moment that you transferred your consciousness into the body of a homunculus, you would need to cast special magic techniques in order to establish a connection to the soul. I ran an ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ on the process and modified it myself. It was the same container I gave <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, the container for the ‘Chaos Core.’</p>
<p id="line_1675">I officially named it Emulated Soul<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The ruby text was rather incomprehensible ギジコン (Gigicon), which is why we went with the kanji" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_1676">“Veldora got the closest answer. This is an emulation of a soul container. I can’t exactly recreate something like a ‘Soul,’ so I decided to settle for the next best thing.”</p>
<p id="line_1677">“Oh, so how did you make something like that?” Veldora seemed very pleased to learn that his answer was the closest and asked me rather smugly.</p>
<p id="line_1678">There was no need to hold back now, so I might as well just explain it. But before that, I’d be a little dramatic. After all, it took me a lot of time and effort to make these, surely, I could shock them a little bit.</p>
<p id="line_1679">“Hold your horses, I will explain in detail. But first, take a look at this. Hold this in your hand and picture your favorite <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> before your eyes.”</p>
<p id="line_1680">Apart from the ‘Emulated Souls,’ I took out some black orbs and put one in everyone’s hands. Veldora tilted his head while gazing intently at the fist-sized object in his hand.</p>
<p id="line_1681">“Hmm? Anything I want?”</p>
<p id="line_1682">“Yeah. Any <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that exists. Even the crazy rare type.”</p>
<p id="line_1683">“Like a goblin or an orc? Can I even have a one-horned rabbit or a man-eating bear?”</p>
<p id="line_1684">“Huh? Sure. But just remember to pick the ones you like. Don’t complain about not liking it after you’ve decided.”</p>
<p id="line_1685">“Hmm, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_1686">“That’s how it is.”</p>
<p id="line_1687">They were as sharp as ever during times like these. Seemingly understanding my words, they began to draw the image in their minds.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1688">The black orb was a Master Core<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="The Kanji reads ‘Magic Essence Core.’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. In order to craft this, the magic core of Charybdis was instrumental. I isolated it in my ‘Stomach’ and had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> analyze it thoroughly.

<p id="line_1689">Before I became a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, all of its negative energy seemed to have been consumed. That’s why, in that moment, it was merely an empty shell. It therefore became the perfect medium for securely containing a soul. And that was—</p>
<p id="line_1690">After some time, the magicule in the air gradually concentrated in the ‘Master Cores’ and created <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. All of them were the ideal forms imagined by Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1691">“How about this, isn’t it interesting? And just as Veldora said, let’s take on the challengers using these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That was the main reason why I gathered everyone here.”</p>
<p id="line_1692">Although that wasn’t the only reason, no one pursued the matter. The trio were deeply moved after seeing the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> they created.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1693">Ignoring the three of them, I also began to create my own <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was a floating soul that had a transparent body—a ghost.</p>
<p id="line_1694">If we don’t consider the stats, it possessed the special ability ‘Physical Nullification.’ Since it was a ghost, you couldn’t exactly hit it physically. And in turn, because it also didn’t possess any physical means <em>to</em> attack, you could only use magic attacks yourself.</p>
<p id="line_1695">Next up, we have Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_1696">I saw a skeleton standing there, a skeleton warrior. He wouldn’t be able to use magic, but perhaps it could learn how to use it in the future. Once it evolved to be a more advanced species, it could probably learn ‘Qi Fighting’ as well.</p>
<p id="line_1697">On the other hand, we have Milim.</p>
<p id="line_1698">Her creature had a damp, gooey body with no hands or feet, and its red color made it stand out—it was a slime.</p>
<p id="line_1699"><em>Hey</em>…</p>
<p id="line_1700">“Oi, why did you make a slime? Are you trying to make fun of me?”</p>
<p id="line_1701">“No way, it’s because… You wanted me to think of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> I like. Why are you complaining?!”</p>
<p id="line_1702">She turned the table against me instead. Never mind, since she seemed to be having fun. Her eyes were glowing as she shouted ‘Slime!’ I did want to ask why it was bright red.</p>
<p id="line_1703">Last but not least, Ramiris.</p>
<p id="line_1704"><em>A knight? Hold on, is it actually a set of armor?</em> It was animated armor. Even though it was a full plate set of armor, for some reason, it looked woefully shabby.</p>
<p id="line_1705">However, among the four <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> we created, hers was the largest. My guess was that Ramiris had an inferiority complex due to her small size. That’s why she imagined a giant <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, to compensate. Yet at the end of the day, it was all looks and nothing behind it, very much Ramiris’s style.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1706">Everyone was gaping in awe at their <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1707">But there were more surprises in store for them.</p>
<p id="line_1708">“Listen now, folks. As Veldora has said, we are going to use these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to beat the labyrinth invaders.”</p>
<p id="line_1709">“Hmm? Invaders—?”</p>
<p id="line_1710">“Indeed. These <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are guardians of the labyrinth, after all. In that sense, wouldn’t the people coming in be invaders?”</p>
<p id="line_1711">“I see, I see how it is.”</p>
<p id="line_1712">“H-how, what is?”</p>
<p id="line_1713">“Hm-hm, Ramiris, we are going to stand at the front line with the labyrinth <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. So, it would be inappropriate to still call them challengers.”</p>
<p id="line_1714">“I get it, now that you’ve put it this way, it would indeed sound strange.”</p>
<p id="line_1715">“Uh-huh, I thought as much.”</p>
<p id="line_1716">Veldora explained in my stead to make Ramiris realize what I meant. Then there was also Milim who was pretending like she understood everything. I wasn’t sure whether she grasped what was going, but I ought to continue the topic, nonetheless.</p>
<p id="line_1717">“Then, do you guys think it is possible to defeat the invaders using these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_1718">“No way, they’re too weak.”</p>
<p id="line_1719">“The armor I created looks really cool, but there’s no way they can make it.”</p>
<p id="line_1720">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’m so disappointed in you. I’ve seen this coming a mile away, these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are an insult to my expectations.”</p>
<p id="line_1721">Hehehe, as I suspected, they started talking trash without a second thought.</p>
<p id="line_1722"><em>By the way, Ramiris and Milim, why are you guys acting all smug. It’s kinda pissing me off. But since I’m the bigger slime, I shall tolerate it for now.</em></p>
<p id="line_1723">“That’s not all, just yet. What comes next is the real deal. Go take a seat and get comfortable. Then aim your Emulated Soul at your <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and shout ‘Possess.”’</p>
<p id="line_1724">I saw a fair amount of skepticism in their faces, yet they still listened and sat down in a comfortable position. The chairs in the conference room were all very cozy and had exquisite cushioning.</p>
<p id="line_1725">All at once, they shouted: “ “ “POSSESS!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_1726">I shouted along with them, and not a moment later, the Emulated Soul in our hands began to glow and was absorbed by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It then began to merge with the Master Core.</p>
<p id="line_1727">The possession of the Master Core was complete.</p>
<p id="line_1728">And at the same time—my consciousness faded. And soon after, the view in front of me changed. The effective range of my usual ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ decreased sharply, making me feel that my field of view had suddenly become much smaller.</p>
<p id="line_1729">By now I had simulated the five senses, so it felt much better than when I first reincarnated. However, unlike me, the other three had not experienced something like this in the past. I figured that they were going to have a hard time. With that in mind, I glanced around…</p>
<p id="line_1730">From my reduced field of vision, I could see a skeleton warrior stretching and a slime moving at abnormal speeds. There was also a set of armor going through rigid motions, looking like some shoddy, bootleg Tin Man.</p>
<p id="line_1731">All three of them sporting their new appearances, each had successfully ‘possessed’ the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> they created.</p>

<p id="line_1733">Hmm, I could feel myself settling in. It felt more natural than I expected, as if I were just controlling my own body. But my abilities were greatly curbed, so moving around wasn’t really smooth. Then again, once I got to know the ghost’s movement, it became very easy to react to things. And soon enough I got to move as I pleased.</p>
<p id="line_1734">It seemed to be no different for the other three.</p>
<p id="line_1735">“ “ “THIS IS AWESOME!” ” ” the trio shouted in sync, after spending some time to confirm the conditions of their new bodies.</p>
<p id="line_1736">“Right? How do you like the result of my research?”</p>
<p id="line_1737">“It’s amazing, truly amazing, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>

I knew you weren’t a simple guy!”</p>
<p id="line_1739">“I was right, after all. I knew I was right to place my confidence in you!”</p>
<p id="line_1740"><em>These guys change their tune on a dime. But seeing how happy they look, it’s truly great.</em></p>
<p id="line_1741">“Um, looks like it was a success. What should we do now that we are transferred to these <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>… Don’t need to spell it out for you guys now, do I?”</p>
<p id="line_1742">“Kukuku, what a silly question. You didn’t want to leave it up to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and hoped that we would duke it out ourselves. What an interesting idea you have, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1743">“Indeed. I’m super pumped to start my own conquest of the labyrinth in this form, though…”</p>
<p id="line_1744">“I know. I get it now; this is a game!”</p>
<p id="line_1745">“What? Is this true, Veldora?”</p>
<p id="line_1746">“Mentor! Then can we defeat enemies with this body? And perhaps make this body evolve as well…?”</p>
<p id="line_1747">As expected from Veldora. He saw right through me. Yep, I was imitating an MMORPG, a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. Although, this wasn’t exactly on a large scale, so I suppose it wasn’t really an MMO, but more like an MO?</p>
<p id="line_1748">Never mind, that’s not important.</p>
<p id="line_1749">The important thing was that we wanted to have some fun in the labyrinth that we went through all the effort to build. That’s the whole point.</p>
<p id="line_1750">“Hehehe, you sure know your stuff, Veldora. You saw right through me so easily. But don’t get the wrong idea. I did develop this in order to enjoy playing this game, but don’t we have other things to take care of before that?”</p>
<p id="line_1751">“GAHAHAHA, are you talking about that thing? So, are we supposed to use these bodies to take care of the challenger problem—no, to defend against the invaders?”</p>
<p id="line_1752"><em>Looks like he got what I meant.</em></p>
<p id="line_1753">Indeed, I planned to use the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> body—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> avatar—to sabotage the rapidly progressing team <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1754">Just like what Ramiris said before, I was considering different ways we could have fun, like leveling up the bodies and learning how to fight with these inconvenient bodies that had many limitations compared to our original ones.</p>
<p id="line_1755">My true intention was for us to be able to get some fun out of defeating <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and challengers. I never thought it would come in handy in this way.</p>
<p id="line_1756">“However, once we’ve done enough preparations, I plan to use it purely to experience the fun of challenging the labyrinth.”</p>
<p id="line_1757">“I see, that way we can also try out our own labyrinth, right?”</p>
<p id="line_1758">“That’s exactly what I meant. Moreover, we can’t really show our true strength using this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> avatar. That means we can alter our perspective and see what problems the labyrinth has.”</p>
<p id="line_1759">“Umm, you’re right. After all, if I were to confront the challengers in the field, my authority as the king of the labyrinth would come into question. If I were, however, to possess some fragile <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…”</p>
<p id="line_1760">“Yes! No longer as a ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ or True Dragon, but as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that can unabashedly fight the invaders in the open.”</p>
<p id="line_1761">“I get it, that sounds like fun!” Milim chimed in, fully on board.</p>
<p id="line_1762">Switching to a new, inconvenient body with all of its limitations probably felt fresh and exciting to her, seeing as she normally did as she pleased while flaunting her power. She seemed thrilled and intrigued by the concept.</p>
<p id="line_1763">“Then let’s get to it.”</p>
<p id="line_1764">“Umm, before we start the game properly, let’s clear out the trash and make the place pretty again.”</p>
<p id="line_1765">“Time to show my moves off. I’ve been itching to test out my forty-eight ultra-instinct kill moves!”</p>
<p id="line_1766">“Although I’m not feeling myself in this, I’m still tempted to try things out!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1767">We set off, filled with motivation. Now it was up to us to take care of the troublesome team <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and make them no longer capable of challenging the lower floors.</p>
<p id="line_1768">In order to achieve this goal—I had come up with an even more devious plan.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1769">Our first order of business was to get familiar with our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> avatars. The second important step was gearing up.</p>
<p id="line_1770">We were equipped with ‘Revival Bracelets’ that suffered from no usage limits, allowing us to resurrect, no matter how many times we died in a row. But that alone would not be enough, as our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> avatars were just recently created and were still low-tier <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Right now, we were nothing more than a couple of chumps, and no matter what we did, we could not harm members of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1771">However, if we were to somehow become equipped with some high-grade gear…</p>
<p id="line_1772">“Next up, it’s important for us to get armed. Let’s go find <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and ask him to make us some weapons and armor!”</p>
<p id="line_1773">“Oh oh, I see! If we were to continue as we are, right now, I’d be nothing more than a rickety skeleton.”</p>
<p id="line_1774">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you fools! My body is a slime, the agile extraordinaire! I’m goo-d to go with what I got!”</p>
<p id="line_1775">“Sorry if this is a dumb question, but if I’m a set of armor… Can I still wear armor?”</p>
<p id="line_1776">“Who knows? Perhaps you can make it work? Let’s take a look first. Milim doesn’t need any weapons, so please stay and keep watch.”</p>
<p id="line_1777">“W-what kind of nonsense! Of course, I <em>could</em> stick with what I have now, but I still want to gear up!”</p>
<p id="line_1778"><em>How stubborn, why didn’t you just say that from the start.</em></p>
<p id="line_1779">Naturally, I wanted some gear too. So, I temporarily broke out of ‘Possession’ and prepared to head out.</p>
<p id="line_1780">“If you want to get back to your original form, just utter ‘Exit’ and you’ll be able to return to your bodies.”</p>
<p id="line_1781">I demonstrated the exit method to them and taught them how to store their Avatar Core<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="These are the result of combining the Master Core with an Emulated Soul." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_1782">The Avatar Core would only record <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> created at a prior point in time. One core corresponded to one <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and you could not change its owner. This item represented everyone’s core, so I reminded them to take good care of it. Thus, I gave further clarification, “With this, you can also call upon your avatar whenever you want.”</p>
<p id="line_1783">“This is amazing. But when we do use ‘Possession,’ we should think about where to place our original body.”</p>
<p id="line_1784">Veldora and Ramiris had reverted to their original forms and stood up from their seats.</p>
<p id="line_1785">“To make sure we don’t lose it, how about we seal it in the bracelet?”</p>
<p id="line_1786">“That’s right, I was gonna do that as well!”</p>
<p id="line_1787">She began to stroke the orb—Avatar Core—happily.</p>
<p id="line_1788">I’d have someone work on the bracelet as well. By the way, what was Milim doing?</p>
<p id="line_1789">“Oi, Mili—”</p>
<p id="line_1790">“I’m going in this form!”</p>
<p id="line_1791">Without letting me finish, Milim, still in her slime form, jumped into my arms.</p>
<p id="line_1792">“Let’s go!” she protested, fully prepared to ignore everyone’s words, and had the scene under her control.</p>
<p id="line_1793">It looked like she really adored the avatar.</p>
<p id="line_1794"><em>That’s kind of childish… But, welp, she’s a kid, after all.</em> You can’t reason with kids about how childish they are. I decided to give up and began to walk away.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1795">We arrived at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workshop.</p>
<p id="line_1796">“Are you there, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_1797">“Oh oh, is it <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama? What can I do for you today?”</p>
<p id="line_1798">As soon as I called, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came out to welcome us.</p>
<p id="line_1799">Seeing that Veldora and Ramiris were with me too, he looked quite surprised.</p>
<p id="line_1800">“Umm,” I said as we walked into the workshop, “I wanted to take some weapons.”</p>
<p id="line_1801">It had been a while since I was last there, the number of people in the workshop had increased—including <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And it was still as hot as ever. I wasn’t affected by temperature though, so it didn’t matter to me. But it looked like working here was quite the hardship.</p>
<p id="line_1802">“Looks like you’ve gotten more disciples.”</p>
<p id="line_1803">“Yes, thanks to your Majesty. Although they still have a long way to go, there are still many talented individuals among our ranks.”</p>
<p id="line_1804">We toured around the workshop as we chatted.</p>
<p id="line_1805">The disciples looked up at the sound of my voice and, seeing me, stood up in unison and saluted.</p>
<p id="line_1806">I was somewhat taken aback, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had gotten used to it at this point.</p>
<p id="line_1807">“Don’t stop! Get back to work,” he bellowed and forced the disciples to carry on.</p>
<p id="line_1808">However, I could relate to how they felt. It was like when a top executive went to visit the average joe’s workplace. People would get nervous. Moreover, the lower on the chain of command, the more nervous the staff would feel.</p>
<p id="line_1809">Although the example doesn’t entirely line up with the situation at hand, in this nation, I was the king. I didn’t really pay attention to such things in the past, but now it was probably better for me to send someone in advance to inform them about such a visit.</p>
<p id="line_1810">Surely, it would concern people if I were to just drop by at random like this. In the company of my original world, if someone such as a general manager were to come around and visit, we would launch an office clean-up the day before and make preparations etc. If the person visiting were to be the director of the company, we would have prepared the office in a way that gave the impression that no failure was tolerated.</p>
<p id="line_1811">The higher the status the visitor was, the more casual they tended to behave, which in turn made us at the bottom put too much thought into preparations.</p>
<p id="line_1812">With that being said… I sincerely hoped they wouldn’t prepare something dramatic every time just because of me. It also made me feel bad to suddenly call <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> while he was busy, so next time I’d be sure to come during off-hours.</p>
<p id="line_1813">“Sorry to barge in on you,” I announced to the room, “I won’t be dropping in this sporadically in the future, no need to be so nervous.”</p>
<p id="line_1814">It may cause a problem if they acted too familiar with me, but there wasn’t a need to be nervous about it. I liked to act cool, but I had no taste for embarrassing people. If they became too nervous, they wouldn’t know how to react, which would also be troubling to me. I preferred an idiot-like response from someone like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1815">TPO—time, place and occasion when reacting to things—I hoped they would understand this.</p>
<p id="line_1816">The disciples were calmed by my words.</p>
<p id="line_1817">Confirming that, I nodded and entered the back room.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1818">—As a side note…</p>
<p id="line_1819">There was something I didn’t know at the time. Those disciples were not just nervous because I was their <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1820">Without my notice, Tempest held a popularity contest. I was voted as one of the top three idols.

<p id="line_1821">I heard that my popularity seemed to have been extraordinarily high. In addition, Ramiris and Milim were candidates as well. I don’t dare to say the ranking, but I heard that Milim and I smashed the top of the charts.</p>

<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1823">“Which types of gear do you need?” as we entered <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s private quarters, he cut to the chase.</p>
<p id="line_1824">“About that—”</p>
<p id="line_1825">Since he asked what we wanted, we each began to list all the items we had in mind.</p>
<p id="line_1826">“I want to ask Garm to craft some armor for us. It should be fun for you two to work together again.”</p>
<p id="line_1827">“You have a point. I was going to check on Garm anyway.”</p>
<p id="line_1828">With that said, we accompanied <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on his way to Garm’s workshop.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1829">We stirred up a commotion once more, but I played dumb this time.</p>
<p id="line_1830">“Gear for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? Ahh, master’s still got all the interesting ideas as always.”</p>
<p id="line_1831">Garm was rather shocked as we each ‘Possessed’ our avatars in front of him.</p>
<p id="line_1832">“I understand. Then I shall do as you asked, actually, let me prepare something even better!”</p>
<p id="line_1833">“Just count on me. I’m getting the creative itch as well. I’m going to create <em>the</em> ultra-strong gear that no human can hope to wield!”</p>
<p id="line_1834"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Garm got on with their craft immediately.</p>
<p id="line_1835"><em>I’m looking forward to it</em>—I thought to myself and left with the folks.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1836">It was gonna take days for the crafting to be completed. We spent this time getting used to the avatars, and thus we began our training.</p>
<p id="line_1837">We did things like fighting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on the upper floors or attacking newcomers who seemed like actual adventurers. During these few days, we began to assign roles and were getting pretty good at it. But before we had reached that level of teamwork, we took plenty of beatings.</p>
<p id="line_1838">We were even losing to beginner teams on the upper floors. There were times when we were taken out by our own traps set in the labyrinth. Those were some awkward moments. That did really piss me off though, leading to the development of magic items that would prevent the labyrinth traps from getting triggered by us. However, the times we did fall to these traps would remain as fond memories.</p>
<p id="line_1839">Ramiris fell into a trap, getting Veldora tangled up in it as well. I floated into the air while Milim got pushed against the ceiling. Since I didn’t have to worry about getting caught in traps, I had gotten careless and forgot to alert them. It was a huge misstep, but, speaking of which, Ramiris… <em>How did you end up falling into a trap?</em> I could feel everyone relentlessly teasing her about it.</p>
<p id="line_1840">And so, as we endured, we trained all day and night without even catching a wink of sleep.</p>
<p id="line_1841">In combat, the most important thing was coordination. Under normal circumstances, we would’ve been able to call out to each other or give signals with a glance. However, we didn’t have neat tricks like that. Mostly because Veldora and Milim were both tryhards.</p>
<p id="line_1842">However, I did have a Skill that was basically like cheating. I could use ‘Telepathy Net’ to contact everyone and deliver them precise commands. With myself as the command post, Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris were my foot soldiers. And in that way, we drastically increased our strength and raised our standards.</p>
<p id="line_1843">Once we could move with a certain level of confidence, we began to review our teamwork. Days passed as we waited for the equipment to be finished.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1844">It was then that we were informed about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> managing to break through Floor 49.</p>
<p id="line_1845">“This is bad. Those people finally beat the tempest serpent.”</p>
<p id="line_1846">“Their combat style is extremely meticulous. Their first group of combatants would collect intelligence, followed by the rest of the teams focusing on draining the enemy’s stamina, and finally beating the guardian using their main force.”</p>
<p id="line_1847">Even if a guardian were to be defeated, they would be revived at full health shortly thereafter. However, in the case that a guardian won, the scars and tiredness accrued would remain. If it were to continue to fight, the circumstances would clearly be in the favor of the challengers.</p>
<p id="line_1848">“That was our miscalculation. We should’ve provided more ways for the guardians to heal themselves.”</p>
<p id="line_1849">“But all those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> rely on instincts to survive,” Veldora commented. His rationale was that those <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weren’t intelligent enough to use healing items.</p>
<p id="line_1850">That was correct, but perhaps there was still a way.</p>
<p id="line_1851">“Should we perhaps ask <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san for help? Being the labyrinth managers, surely, they would be able to heal the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_1852">“Ah, I see. I should go ask her for help!”</p>
<p id="line_1853">And that was how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s sisters became part of the aid team to heal the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> when they were wrapped up in continuous fights.</p>
<p id="line_1854">Thus, one by one, we managed to address all the issues.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1855">Next—</p>
<p id="line_1856">“Those people are approaching Floor 49 fast, what do we do, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?” Milim asked anxiously.</p>
<p id="line_1857">Like she said, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was about to enter the final battle ground with us.</p>
<p id="line_1858">“Our coordination should be sufficient despite our lack of equipment. Shall we attack them straight away?”</p>
<p id="line_1859">“I agree! It’s finally time for me to shine. I’m gonna beat the devil out of those folks!”</p>
<p id="line_1860">Veldora and Ramiris were pumped.</p>
<p id="line_1861">To be honest, even if we were to fight seriously, our chances of winning weren’t that high. I put my strongest traps on Floor 49, so that was the only location where we could pull back team <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1862">“This can’t be helped, huh? We should at least wear some emergency gear—”</p>
<p id="line_1863">Anyway, even if we were wearing top gear crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Garm, we wouldn’t be able to face our enemies head-on. Although it would greatly increase the chances of our victory, so we might as well give it a try.</p>
<p id="line_1864">Upon thinking so, I was about to decide when—</p>
<p id="line_1865"><em>Knock knock.</em></p>
<p id="line_1866">The sound of someone knocking on the door rang in the meeting room.</p>
<p id="line_1867">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to tell you that ‘He’s ready,”’ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> notified me.</p>
<p id="line_1868">Hearing the news, we looked at each other with grins on our faces.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1869">The gear specially crafted for our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> avatars had been completed.</p>
<p id="line_1870">My gear were the Grim Reaper’s scythe and robes of hell. A ghost could wear equipment as well, it was a specific property of magical gear.</p>
<p id="line_1871">Veldora’s got the Grim Reaper’s bastard sword and full body armor of hell. His left hand was equipped with the great shield of hell’s gate. He was fully geared up.</p>
<p id="line_1872">As for Milim who was playing a slime, she could only be equipped with simple things. She first swallowed the Grim Reaper’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="javelin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and wore a crimson feathered cape. She immediately gained a pair of red wings after equipping it.</p>
<p id="line_1873"><em>That’s some incredible change.</em></p>
<p id="line_1874">“The gear has to be equipped or it won’t activate the effect!” Milim said with glee.</p>
<p id="line_1875">Since she was happy, I had no room to say anything.</p>
<p id="line_1876">Ramiris was next. She asked for heavy full body armor from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The armor itself was finely crafted, the problem was whether or not she could wear it. Ramiris anxiously transferred herself to her avatar and tried to put on the armor. At that moment, lo and behold, the armor had been swapped out. With a loud ‘Clang,’ the rubbish armor fell to the ground and turned into dust before being blown away by the wind.</p>
<p id="line_1877">Ramiris’s animated armor became heavy animated armor. This was not an evolution, and it also didn’t seem to be a change in equipment. Instead, the pieces of armor themselves swapped their places.</p>
<p id="line_1878">“Eh, I move so swiftly now!”</p>
<p id="line_1879">Just as Ramiris said, before this her movement was very unnatural, like she needed to be lubricated. Now her movement looked very smooth. This would, surely, make coordination much smoother with her.</p>
<p id="line_1880">I never expected the quality of the armor to have an effect on movement. What an unexpected discovery.</p>
<p id="line_1881">Seeing how happy Ramiris looked, I asked her to choose her weapons and shield.</p>
<p id="line_1882">“Pooh! Stuff like shields are unnecessary for me!” saying that, she chose a large two-handed weapon, the Grim Reaper’s great axe.</p>
<p id="line_1883">Its sheer might makes it a top-notch weapon, though wielding it may prove difficult. But never mind that, this would do. She always got mocked for being weak, so she probably got a little carried away this time. Interestingly, it reflected her personality as well.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1884">And so, everyone changed to their new equipment.</p>
<p id="line_1885">This equipment fell under unique-grade. Since they were adjusted to be equipped by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, their designs, however, were rather unbalanced and comical in nature. Still, for any amateur adventurers, this was incredibly strong gear. We also applied some sort of a curse to register their users, so that they couldn’t be stolen. To us right now, these were the best gear out there.</p>
<p id="line_1886">This new switch restored our resolve. Before we embarked on our battle, our spirits were soaring.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1887">We checked the status of our avatars.</p>
<p id="line_1888">My ghost had given up physical attacks and focused on magic and mental attacks. It served the role of a sorcerer. I hoped to learn about ‘Spirit Magic’ and ‘Illusion Magic’ soon, since my goal was to become a wizard. Aside from that, I also wanted to learn ‘Holy Magic.’ What would happen if I placed my faith in myself? That was kind of part of my experiment.</p>
<p id="line_1889">Veldora’s skeleton swordsman was a Jack of all trades, he could do anything. He served the role of a heavy warrior, but seemed to want to learn magic and become a magic knight.</p>
<p id="line_1890">Milim’s slime, on the other hand, specialized in speed and one-shot-kills. She’s the super buffed type. Or perhaps I should call her the romantic type?<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="TL note: I believe Romantic Type (浪漫型) here has a similar meaning to phrase like ‘メカは男の浪漫’ (Robots are men’s romance), it is just an otaku thing to say when you really enjoy/are attracted to certain archetype or genre." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> It was her job to be the assassin. She may have been able to learn a thing or two from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but I had forbidden her from troubling others when she was just fooling around.</p>
<p id="line_1891">Her approach was to launch an ambush by dropping from the ceiling for quick takedowns. If the enemies fell for it, she’d look like a boss. But what would she do if the enemies saw through such a setup? Well, I think she would run away, considering her high mobility. In some ways, slime was the perfect form for this.</p>
<p id="line_1892">Ramiris’s heavy animated armor focused on strong attacks. It possessed some level of defense and even had the potential to be quite balanced. She fit the role of berserker. Not that she had really gone berserk, but it seemed that she has never considered her defensive capabilities. That was just how I had been calling her since she decided to become a dangerous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bent on attacking. Once she had gotten familiarized with her abilities, I wanted her to team up with Veldora and play the role of shield for him.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1893">Everything was prepared.</p>
<p id="line_1894">We wouldn’t get hungry, so our ability to fight on end would really shine.</p>
<p id="line_1895"><em>Let’s fire up our spirits and try our best in stopping the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</em></p>
<p id="line_1896">With a burning spirit, we stepped onto the battlefield. Yet it turned out—to our great disappointment, we crushed the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with ease…</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1897"><em>Gotta stay calm, yep, I gotta stay calm.</em></p>
<p id="line_1898">As I <em>calmly</em> ran ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ on my avatar, I realized its power was almost at rank A. This was mostly thanks to my gear, but it’s pretty much the case when I was able to use my power smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_1899">However, we miscalculated one thing. The abilities of our original selves would be reflected in the avatars. Even though we couldn’t use all of our Skills, with ‘Thought Communication’ and ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Thought Acceleration" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ alone, these were enough to turn the favor to our side.</p>
<p id="line_1900">For me personally, I could cast magic so fast it was almost cheating. Bound by my mana pool, I could not use all the magic, but my vast arcane knowledge remained. Compared to a third-rate court mage, my magic was still leagues ahead. I didn’t need to chant my spells and could cast consecutively without delay. Surely our enemy couldn’t handle that.</p>
<p id="line_1901">As for Veldora, I almost suspected that he had a pair of eyes in the back of his head. He swung his sword like a master of swordsmanship.</p>
<p id="line_1902">“GAHAHAHA! My ‘Veldora-Style Killing Arts<sup>TM</sup>’ incorporates countless sword techniques. Hold on, that’s not how it goes—“ and on he went with his nonsense.</p>
<p id="line_1903">Veldora seemed to have learned some techniques from the manga he read. And I thought that mangas were just making up the drawings, looks like there were actually practical techniques out there as well.</p>
<p id="line_1904">Veldora was pretty unpredictable to begin with, so nothing could really surprise me at this point. Looking at him closely enough, you would realize he was acting like a moron.</p>
<p id="line_1905">On the other hand, we had Milim. She wasn’t lying when she said that she focused on speed. She zipped around at break-neck speeds. It was beyond what the average person could control, let alone replicate, yet with Milim’s reflexes, it was a piece of cake. Actually, I should say that that’s just how fast a slime could move when it got serious. She could ignore friction while sliding across the ground and closed in on the enemies with a bounce. The way she darted along the ceiling with the same speed, surely, made it close to impossible for your everyday adventurer to spot her clearly.</p>
<p id="line_1906">I was a slime as well, yet I’d never realized such a thing until now. I was profoundly shocked.</p>
<p id="line_1907">“WAHAHAHA! You are so slow, all so slow. Eat this, you dimwit!”</p>
<p id="line_1908">Milim snuck behind her enemy without making a sound, acting all smug about it, and impaled the enemy’s neck with her Grim Reaper’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="javelin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—most fights with her ended like that.</p>
<p id="line_1909">Physical attacks couldn’t easily harm her, and in order to cast magic against her, you would first need to get a clear fix on her. Now that I thought about this, it was pretty terrifying to fight Milim’s slime as your opponent.</p>
<p id="line_1910">The person to complement Veldora and Milim was Ramiris, the ‘Professional Wingman.’</p>
<p id="line_1911">“WHOOOA! LET ME SHOW YOU HOW STRONG I AM!”</p>
<p id="line_1912">She led the charge as soon as we saw enemies. In addition, Ramiris’s combat style was to fight people head-on. Under normal circumstances, this was a risky move that rarely acted in her favor. She’s such an idiot. But for the rest of us, her doing so was the right tactic. After reminding her several times to no avail, we turned this in our favor. In short, we used Ramiris as bait while we launched a three-pronged attack.</p>
<p id="line_1913">Normally, it would’ve been tricky to pull this off. But Ramiris set loose on a blind rampage, utterly disregarding defense. All the enemies saw was a large set of armor wielding the Grim Reaper’s great axe barreling towards them. By then, confronting it was inevitable.</p>
<p id="line_1914">Because she completely neglected defense, all of their attacks were focused on Ramiris. However, she had ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Pain Nullification" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ that’s why she didn’t even flinch and launched attacks one after another.</p>
<p id="line_1915">In addition, the armor itself was very sturdy. Sparing no cost and paying no mind to weight, the heavy animated armor was crafted out of thick sheets of magisteel. That imbued it with some level of ‘Self Reconstruction,’ so a couple scratches were nothing to worry about. The sheer weight of the armor was enough to crush the average person, and imagining such a giant hunk of metal charging at you—the threat it posed to our enemies was readily apparent.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1916">Oh, and then there was my healing magic. As part of my experiment, I tried to cast ‘Holy Magic’ and found that I easily managed to pull it off, much to my surprise. As opposed to believing in myself, I controlled the ‘Spirit Particles’ that I originally could not manipulate through the use of prayers.</p>
<p id="line_1917">This time, with me turned into a ghost, both the mana of my body and the words of my prayer would reach my original body. I then cast the magic borrowing the power of my original body. The purpose of prayer seemed to be to convey the will to execute the action.</p>
<p id="line_1918">When manipulating ‘Spirit Particles,’ you needed to listen to the individual wish of the prayer to execute them accordingly—with such a complex action, no matter how advanced my processing power was, I wouldn’t be able to do it. That’s why I turned to a different method and had different individuals conduct the calculation.</p>
<p id="line_1919">As the number of people who prayed—my believers—increased, my mana rose in kind. In other words, I could improve my “godliness.”</p>
<p id="line_1920">In addition, because I was connected to my believers, it also served as a secret technique. I could use the minds of my own believers to expand my processing power. This would also allow me to lend them mana and processing power.</p>
<p id="line_1921"><em>I see how it is now.</em> That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to expand the number of followers she had.

<p id="line_1923">Let’s drop that for now.</p>
<p id="line_1924">Considering this, I could now cast ‘Holy Magic.’ As a result, our team was extremely strong.

<p class="space-break" id="line_1925">We shouldn’t be afraid to face anything; we should embrace challenges. Had we attacked head-on, we would have been defeated long ago. But rather, we honed our coordination and utilized traps.</p>
<p id="line_1926">We ordered the slime dolls to damage our enemies’ weapons.</p>
<p id="line_1927">We used slime rain to distract them and cause them to waste their stamina.</p>
<p id="line_1928">We took the chance to ambush them and backed them into the slime pool.</p>
<p id="line_1929">Ramiris roared to attract the enemies’ attention when Milim launched her sneak attack to completely disrupt the enemy’s formation. Veldora focused on cutting them off and isolating the rearguard. We used the giant slime to defeat the weaker mages and thieves and had Veldora and Ramiris force the rest of their main combat force into the slime pool.</p>
<p id="line_1930">The goal was to destroy their gear with strong acid.

That was our goal in this fight.</p>
<p id="line_1931">“Annoying! All our hard work—ruined!”</p>
<p id="line_1932">The pathetic cry made me realize that the captain of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a woman. That surprised me a bit, but what she said next caught my attention even more so.</p>
<p id="line_1933">“Let’s retreat while we’ve still made some gains. This is probably a good point to stop.”</p>
<p id="line_1934">“You’re right, ‘home nation’ has given the order anyway.”</p>
<p id="line_1935">She talked to a surviving male member of the team that seemed to be her subordinate. She did just say that “the home nation has given the order.” I heard that the mercenary group <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t belong to any nation; they were free-lancers.

The way she said “home nation gave the order” sounded as though their loyalty towards it was more than a mere customer.</p>
<p id="line_1936"><em>Looks like I need to be mindful of it.</em></p>
<p id="line_1937">Since the dungeon would attract customers, it was gonna attract many people with unchecked backgrounds. Regarding that, I’d been mentally prepared for it from the start, but it seemed that I needed to remind everyone about that once again.

<p id="line_1949">No one knew how old this mysterious person was.</p>
<p id="line_1950">As the Five Great Elders controlled the Council, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the head of the Elders.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1953">Currency is required for the development of a civilization.</p>
<p id="line_1954">In the past, crops such as wheat were used for bartering, but as humanity entered the era of monetary economy, civilization made a giant leap forward. The main reason was due to growth in the scale of economies.</p>
<p id="line_1955">In addition, the value of currency also changed. Currencies were once made of valuable metals such as gold and silver to ensure its value. However, in the new age, physical currencies were replaced by certificates and documents during trade.</p>
<p id="line_1956">That was the birth of the paper money economy.</p>
<p id="line_1957">And so, a mechanism required for the money to flow was born—the banking system. You would receive receipts by storing your gold coins in a bank, and in return, you could exchange those receipts for the physical, material currency. The banks could utilize the money stored in them at will; thus, they came up with a different mode of business: loaning money to those in need and turning a profit by setting interest rates.</p>
<p id="line_1958">This was a sorcery worse than alchemy.</p>
<p id="line_1959">Primarily, there was no money there, and yet, interest was accruing. On one hand was the total amount of physical money circulating in the market, and on the other was the total amount of receipts. When comparing the two, there would always be a certain unrecoverable difference… Someone would eventually have to pay the price for being unable to cover this fabricated margin.</p>
<p id="line_1960">This fundamental issue was inherent to the system of lending money and receiving interest.</p>
<p id="line_1961">Such a phenomenon became even worse when physical currencies were replaced by paper money. People would ask for loans from rich people with the interest rate as bait. Afterward, they would use the money to invest in financial products—to use money to make money. This cycle would continue beyond national boundaries and into the entire world.</p>
<p id="line_1962">Guaranteed in the name of the state, cash would be printed without limits. Meanwhile, the relative differences in national power would be exploited to manipulate the exchange rate and expand the scale of the economy to a dozen times its previous size. Including even the amount of paper money issued, the market was dominated by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1963">The illusion of a large-scale economy was far from the real economy. It was much, much smaller in reality. And one day, this bubble would burst.</p>
<p id="line_1964">Just as her former self, who inflated the bubble as much as possible before bursting it, she would then push unpayable debts to the weaker countries and have them take on the responsibility.</p>
<p id="line_1965">—In other words, it was a war of balancing the accounts. In this way, weaker nations would crumble, while the rich would get richer. Instead of a single person paying the price, a whole nation would. There was basically not that much difference.</p>

She was known as a financial genius in her past life. She had the memories of her past life and an intense desire to dominate. These all fueled <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power: her Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Greed" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ The Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Greed" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ originated from the seven original sins of man. It belonged to the Skill type known as the ‘Deadly Sins.’ These were a special presence even among Unique Skills, as they represented the desire of their users. The users’ emotions and wishes manifested in the form of their Skills.</p>
<p id="line_1967">In fact, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was born to be the strongest among the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_1968">She could see through people’s desires. The greater their desires were, the easier they could be manipulated.

Starting from people around her, she gradually increased the number of pawns she owned.</p>
<p id="line_1969">There was no need to panic. For she had already realized that the civilization of this world was not advanced enough. Even though there <em>was</em> an economy, within their economic circle, only one form of currency was used. It was a world without language barriers, quite unlike the world she came from.</p>
<p id="line_1970">But seeing it from a different light, she could exploit her environment. It was to the point that she thought this was her own personal playground.</p>
<p id="line_1971"><em>Yes, yes indeed. I will dominate this world as well.</em></p>

<h1 class="ch-number">Chapter 3</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">The Council</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_2003">In the small Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Siltrosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, situated in the north, a meeting was about to begin. A young man and an elder were facing off against each other.</p>
<p id="line_2004">The young man was the head of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kagurazaka.</p>
<p id="line_2005">The elder’s name was Johann Rostia. He was the biggest financial backer of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and a major figure within the council, being the duke of the Kingdom of Rostia. Given his surname being Rostia, his being the elder brother to the current king of Rostia was obvious.</p>
<p id="line_2006">Yet in truth, his real identity was one of the Five Great Elders manipulating the council. They often gathered for their secret meetings in this land—the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Siltrosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. This small kingdom on the border was perfect to fool the Western Nations, since an espionage organization held their secret base here—the best espionage organization among the Western Nations, in fact.</p>
<p id="line_2007">It was called the “Silt Foreign Information Bureau.” This organization set its attention beyond the petty disputes of humans and instead aimed to deter threats of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Its purpose was for crisis management.</p>
<p id="line_2008">Therefore, the agents from the agencies all had impressive portfolios. Every single member was rank B or above. They were few in number, but could all be considered as the elite among the elite. With such agents guarding the kingdom, infiltration of spies from other nations was impossible.</p>
<p id="line_2009">That was why they chose this location to conduct their secret meetings.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2010">“Begin your report.”</p>
<p id="line_2011">“Okay. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has completely seen through me and seems to have grown suspicious of me.

That being said, their relationship was strictly business related. The reason they preserved their relationship was due to the fact that both sides stood to gain a profit.</p>
<p id="line_2015">The Council funded the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> while the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> accepted jobs from the Council in return. The two organizations were equal in status and supported each other.</p>
<p id="line_2016">—All the aforementioned relations were a facade.

If they were to operate in other nations, they required the respective nations’ approval and care. Without such support, they wouldn’t be able to continue.</p>
<p id="line_2017">While the Association had greater influence than when it was just a mutual-aid society for the adventurers, in terms of authority and power, the Council was still superior.</p>
<p id="line_2018">Moreover, the reason why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was able to expand the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in just a span of a few years was due to the aid of the Great Elder Johann.

Just like what she had done to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to control others without them knowing.</p>
<p id="line_2084">There were, in fact, two ways she could achieve this.</p>
<p id="line_2085">The first way: Using her own desires to overcome the desires of her subject, leading the two to agree on a goal and therefore, turn her opponent into her ally. As for the drawback of this method, it was that it could only be activated in conversation-length interactions. It was like a toxin with a delayed effect, which meant she needed to try multiple times in order for such an opportunity to emerge. However, it was difficult to avoid raising suspicion since, in the eyes of others, lasting conversations might appear unnatural.</p>
<p id="line_2086">In addition, not only did she need to find the right timing for these conversations, but the amount of ‘desire’<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Ruby text reads ‘Poison’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> she could insert into others’ minds was also limited. She needed patience to slowly achieve her goal in this way.</p>
<p id="line_2087">The second method worked much faster. She simply used her Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Greed" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to forcefully dominate her target. It didn’t take as much time, as she could directly inject all the ‘desire’ required and completely destroy her target’s will, turning it into a walking puppet.</p>
<p id="line_2088">But this technique was too dangerous. Depending on the extent of her target’s desire, it might take different lengths of time. Even if it were for just a few seconds, for someone as strong as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it would be enough time for him to kill <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

It was to be expected from a Skill that originated from humans’ fundamental desires. No one could resist it.</p>
<p id="line_2090">The problem lay with the amount of time needed, as well as the extent of one’s desire.

<p id="line_2115">“N-nothing. I’m just worried that someone may crack your control,” Johann answered rather nervously.</p>
<p id="line_2116">“Your fears are unfounded. Once corrupted, a desire can never be restored—as long as it does not surpass mine.”</p>

<p id="line_2118">“Y-you have a point.

<p id="line_2137">“Blazing wind, turn into a whirling tornado and cut through your enemies! Blow, Tornado Blade!”</p>
<p id="line_2138">It was a mistake to have bunched together. As if laughing at those cautious foes, the Tornado Blade I unleashed cut right into them.</p>
<p id="line_2139">Tornado Blade was an area magic version of Wind Cutter. It cost a couple more magicules, but it could be used to attack multiple enemies in a specific area. It was great for taking on a full squad of enemies.</p>
<p id="line_2140">Milim ambushed the people in charge of checking traps as they were walking at the front. After quickly injuring her opponents, she had left the scene before I cast the magic.</p>
<p id="line_2141">The people to the rear of the squad had no clue what even happened. But as they became alerted, I followed up the attack with the Wind Cutter. It didn’t affect Milim, and my magic took out the entire enemy squad.</p>

<p id="line_2144">“Bastards! You whoresons! How dare you kill them?!”</p>
<p id="line_2145">The enemies roared in rage upon realizing what was going on. They were, in other words, the challengers of the labyrinth. It looked like a relatively balanced group of adventurers this time. However, our experience and strength were both far superior to them.</p>
<p id="line_2146">We took the initiative and took out the explorers within the enemy team. In order to make use of their being unaware of our presence, we made a preemptive attack using anti-group magic. Before discovering the enemy team, we would operate with invisibility magic applied. We would always see them coming first.</p>
<p id="line_2147">Once we attacked, the invisibility spell would deactivate, but by that time, we would have downed at least one or two men. They were usually the mage or healer at the back of the team, providing support. At this point, it’s like the game had already been decided.</p>
<p id="line_2148">As we came out of our invisibility spell, the enraged vanguards quickly discovered us and charged.</p>
<p id="line_2149">“GAHAHAHA! YOU ARE ALL TOO NAIVE!”</p>
<p id="line_2150">“WO—HEHEHE! DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT LEAVING THIS PLACE!”</p>
<p id="line_2151">Veldora and Ramiris, fully immersed in their roles, handled the assault.</p>
<p id="line_2152">Since there was no need for me to show up, I decided to hang back and just provide aid for the two of them. I also used analysis magic to investigate the warriors charging at us. There were red health bars above all of their heads which had dropped below half at that point.</p>
<p id="line_2153">“These people have less than half of their HP. Surely, you two would be enough to handle these guys?”</p>
<p id="line_2154">It wasn’t that I was getting ahead of myself, just confirming the state of our enemies.</p>
<p id="line_2155">Indeed, the red bar above the warriors’ heads indicated their hit points. Only I could see it due to the analysis magic. To make everything clearer, I made it so that it would look like something that would be in a video game. Even if other people used the same type of magic, they would probably see it differently.</p>
<p id="line_2156">That aside, it was convenient enough for me to use. Seeing things being expressed in a familiar manner, I was able to quickly identify the situation and give the appropriate commands.</p>
<p id="line_2157">Considering how things had developed, we had this one in the bag.</p>
<p id="line_2158">Without the supporting aid from the back, the vanguard didn’t stand a chance against Veldora and Ramiris. They had no defensive buffs, spell or healing. With their HP decreased, they had no chance.</p>
<p id="line_2159">If this were a more cautious team, they would have had a ‘Barrier’ set up at all times… But it seemed that the team wasn’t really that type.</p>
<p id="line_2160">And so, Veldora and Ramiris happily slayed the three remaining foes.</p>
<p id="line_2161">It was an easy win.</p>
<p id="line_2162">With Milim’s sneak attack on top of my magic, we were able to take out the scout and the rear guards—and that was our “gg ez” strategy.</p>
<p id="line_2163">However, we’d been picking too many fights lately, and it was inefficient. Even though the challengers’ strategies hadn’t been perfected, there were certainly more people thinking about them. The labyrinth challengers weren’t stupid. They were trying hard every day to improve as well.</p>
<p id="line_2164">While that was certainly pleasant to hear, we also had to reconsider our engagement strategy with them.</p>
<p id="line_2165">—As I thought so, the last man in front of us disappeared, fading away in beams of light.</p>
<p id="line_2166">The battle was over.</p>
<p id="line_2167">I’d seen this scene a million times at this point.</p>
<p id="line_2168">“Amazing! These rookies were no match for us either!”</p>
<p id="line_2169">“WUHEHE, that’s it! WE ARE THE STRONGEST, THE INVINCIBLE!”</p>
<p id="line_2170">“GAHAHAHA! THOSE ROOKIES WEREN’T EVEN ENOUGH AS MY APPETIZERS.”</p>
<p id="line_2171">My companions had gotten smug enough to brag about their achievement.</p>
<p id="line_2172">Indeed, we four made up the team.</p>
<p id="line_2173">—Eh, you want to know what we were up to all this time?</p>
<p id="line_2174">That goes without saying. We were using labyrinth challengers as the test subjects for our strategies.</p>
<p id="line_2175">We all loved learning and had been studying tirelessly every, single, day.</p>
<p id="line_2176">………</p>
<p id="line_2177">……</p>
<p id="line_2178">…</p>
<p id="line_2179">Umm, but what about the whole <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> deal from last time?</p>
<p id="line_2180">It had been a great win, but we weren’t satisfied just yet. We hadn’t seen the team <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> ever since, either. They were apparently called back by their home nation, possibly never to return.</p>
<p id="line_2181">With that being said, it might also have been because they had difficulty obtaining new gear for new floors. I was not sure whether they would return one day or not, but we had to get ready to fight them, nonetheless.</p>
<p id="line_2182">That’s why, even if we had defeated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we were going to keep roaming the labyrinth in secret to fight off challengers. In addition, another reason was the increased popularity of the labyrinth.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2183">Several days had passed after our fight to the death with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Green Rebellion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party managed to break through Floor 49.</p>
<p id="line_2184"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the real lucky star as he managed to collect the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> weapon series. With it, they successfully defeated the tempest serpent, and now they aimed to challenge Floor 50. With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party making it beyond Floor 49, the other challengers became much more motivated. And as we’d hoped, many capable individuals set their sights on Floor 49.</p>
<p id="line_2185">We publicized the video footage of the guardian fight as a test and it was received very well. We used the video projector to record the fight between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s team and the tempest serpent. It became a hot topic even within the town as people kept on requesting to replay the clip.</p>
<p id="line_2186">There was money to be made with this—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I thought to ourselves. There was no television in this world, so the battle footage within the labyrinth was considered to be top tier entertainment. But, obviously, considering the potentially gruesome scenes that would be showcased, we considered editing the footage beforehand.</p>
<p id="line_2187">However, some people seemed to prefer the uncut version. Therefore, there was some room reserved for negotiation in that regard—mainly depending on how much the people asking would pay.</p>
<p id="line_2188">There were also issues regarding the broadcasting rights, portrait rights, etc. All of the cumbersome formalities were handed to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2189"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s smile could probably be its own merchandise. That patented smile alone would earn us a sweet sum of money. In that way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would get some benefit, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I would also be counting cash. Apart from learning from the mistakes, we were also looking forward to the future development of the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_2190">The video footage was not limited to the video directly recorded by the magic item. We had actually saved a lot of things. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san also extracted a large amount of data from the labyrinth. By conducting “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” on it, it was possible to recreate the images. We also made video compilations of cool performances by the challengers and broadcasted them.</p>
<p id="line_2191">They turned out to be a big hit. Some people were even saying “Thanks to this footage, I got to have a girlfriend!” Many people who wanted to become famous were tempted to give it a try. Even people who weren’t serious before, began to put in some hard work.</p>
<p id="line_2192">I mean, I knew the feeling.</p>
<p id="line_2193">Even though it might be cruel to say this, at least they put in more effort. But in front of them was a high wall called reality. Don’t be too idealistic just yet! On the notion of giving tough love to our contestants, <em>we</em> began to interfere with the challengers’ progress.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2194">Nowadays we were called the ‘Dungeon Dominators’<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Kanji reads “Reapers of the labyrinth”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, feared by all.</p>
<p id="line_2195">Our appearance also had some drastic changes.</p>
<p id="line_2196">The ghost controlled by me now had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> surrounding it, engulfed in blue and white flames—a Fire Aura. I found this to be a very stylish look for me.</p>
<p id="line_2197">As for Veldora’s skeleton swordsman, all of his bones were renewed. Seeing how Ramiris’s armor changed, Veldora wanted to renew his bones as well.</p>
<p id="line_2198">I asked him what he wanted, and he responded rather recklessly, that “A gold skull suits me better.” I was just going to ignore his request at first. But since I also had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s request to handle, I tried to change my perspective on the matter and thought that I could use Veldora as an experiment for temporary flesh replacement. I wanted to test the metallic skeleton body’s abilities, so I decided to exchange that with Veldora’s avatar.</p>
<p id="line_2199">Ordinary gold wasn’t very strong. That was why I decided to utilize the strongest material I had available instead, though it was still in the experimental phase.</p>
<p id="line_2200">It happened to be golden as well, so I decided to go ahead with it. It was called ‘orichalcum’<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Orichalcum or aurichalcum is a metal mentioned in several ancient writings, including the story of Atlantis in the Critias of Plato." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, a special alloy refined from a mixture of magisteel and gold, while also infused with an unusually dense concentration of magicules. I wanted to combine the immutability of gold on top of the traits of magisteel.</p>
<p id="line_2201">The result was very successful, not just in terms of strength. The overall performance of orichalcum exceeded magisteel; it was an incredible metal. And so, orichalcum was born.</p>
<p id="line_2202">The problem with it, however, was the difficulty of its production. Gold itself was already rare and could not be produced en masse.</p>
<p id="line_2203">However, this time I humored Veldora’s request. Which was why I spent a hefty sum of money making the orichalcum and fabricating the humanoid skeleton.</p>
<p id="line_2204">As with Ramiris’ outfit, all we needed was a Master Core, since it didn’t matter what type of skeleton we had installed for Veldora. And in the blink of an eye, the golden skeleton swordsman was born in the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_2205">His bones were insanely strong, nothing like his previous skeleton.</p>
<p id="line_2206">I closely observed Veldora’s skeleton swordsman to examine its durability, as well as any potential flaws.</p>
<p id="line_2207">Milim’s reputation, on the other hand, was even more far-reaching. People were all afraid of the infamous ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Crimson Comet" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ With her abnormal speed, her afterimage looked like a red comet.</p>
<p id="line_2208">She abandoned all her techniques besides speed and focused on landing critical hits to achieve victory. This fighting style instilled fear and made her a legend.</p>
<p id="line_2209">Ramiris’s style also changed slowly. She became the brawn type and had been giving off an ominous energy around her. She glowed with purple flames—her heavy animated armor was enveloped in an aura of death.</p>
<p id="line_2210">She would wield her Grim Reaper’s great axe to crush her enemy and never backed down from a fight. This ended up giving her the reputation of the crazed heavy animated armor.</p>
<p id="line_2211">Her avatar might be stronger than her… No, never mind.</p>
<p id="line_2212">For the sake of Ramiris’s own reputation, it was best to let matters lie.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2213">And so, in a span of a few days, we all became famous.</p>
<p id="line_2214">The challengers’ response was pretty good as well. They all seemed to be afraid of us and kept their guard up against us. We were stronger than most low-level bosses, and also much meaner.</p>
<p id="line_2215">It was only natural for the challengers to react this way.</p>
<p id="line_2216">As I said before, our primary objective was to study how to fight within the labyrinth. We definitely weren’t just messing around for fun. You MUST not confuse that. We had been working hard every day and diving into our research. Surely, with the hard work that we’d put in, it would be useful someday.</p>
<p id="line_2217">In fact, we had seen many challengers using rare Extra Skills as well as seemingly original magic spells. We had learned a lot from it.</p>
<p id="line_2218">Nowadays, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san could extract intelligence from the labyrinth directly, using ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ and so the labyrinth had become a vault of information.</p>
<p id="line_2219">In addition, just as our own techniques would be reflected on the avatars, the things we learned via the avatars would also come back to our original bodies. This was an unexpected outcome, but was quickly considered as a new way to train.</p>
<p id="line_2220">And so, we performed our research every day.</p>
<p id="line_2221">Naturally, we made an ample number of new discoveries.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2222">There was one time that we got a bit too arrogant and decided to challenge the entire labyrinth with our team.</p>
<p id="line_2223">We quickly met our disastrous defeat.</p>
<p id="line_2224">With our abilities alone, we could not even get past the guardian on the fiftieth floor—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We couldn’t hold a candle to opponents above rank A if we were to fight fairly. And even if we were to sneak attack, it wouldn’t have worked on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He was like a brick wall standing in front of us.</p>
<p id="line_2225">On one hand, we wanted to praise him for his competence, but on the other hand, we were thinking, “Now we will have to defeat him.” And based on this thought, we began to train our avatars with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p id="line_2226">It was a form of learning one way or another. The process of training and self-improvement. And DEFINITELY not messing around for fun.</p>
<p id="line_2227">Seriously, please remember this point in particular!</p>
<p id="line_2228">………</p>
<p id="line_2229">……</p>
<p id="line_2230">…</p>
<p id="line_2231">And like that, we watched the challengers as they gradually disappeared.</p>
<p id="line_2232">“That was an easy win.”</p>
<p id="line_2233">Hearing my comment, the other three nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_2234">This was around Floor 38. The rank A-minus tempest serpent was almost in front of us. Its power wasn’t just for show, as its above average strength was much greater than that of most challengers. And to us in our avatars, if we were careless, we would also fall into a tough fight.</p>
<p id="line_2235">Considering our growth rate, this was the perfect hunting ground. It was best to continue at this pace.</p>
<p id="line_2236">Upon thinking so, my emergency contact ‘Clone’ in the office suddenly reached out to me.</p>
<p id="line_2237"><em>What happened?</em> As the thought crossed my mind, the message delivered by it to me was: “There is a guest that requires urgent attendance.”</p>
<p id="line_2238"><em>Looks like this is no time for playin</em>—</p>
<p id="line_2239">No, no. Learning, not playing.</p>
<p id="line_2240">This was important, we would remind everyone again to not mistake the two things.</p>
<p id="line_2241">Time to head to the office.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2242">By the time I got there, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Rigurd were already waiting.</p>
<p id="line_2243">There was someone else. A familiar female, ah yes, her. Ex-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Frey was sitting in my office. Apparently, the VIP was her.</p>
<p id="line_2244">She turned to me first as I entered. Her eyes then momentarily landed on Veldora before stopping on Milim, who entered the room last. She smiled.</p>
<p id="line_2245">Hm? Why did that smile look so unwholesome?</p>
<p id="line_2246">“Ara, Milim. So this is where you’ve been? Speaking of which, did you finish the work I assigned to you? The people who were supposedly guarding you were tied up and put down. Could you please explain to me what happened during that time?” Frey said, still smiling.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2247">This was more like an interrogation. Honestly, super scary.</p>
<p id="line_2248">Even though I wasn’t the person being questioned, it still felt mighty uncomfortable sitting in the room.</p>
<p id="line_2249">Indeed, my friend should have finished all her homework before playing with us. But now she’d been caught, not even having started it yet, by her parent and was being scolded—that was the scene I saw before me… How very reminiscent.</p>
<p id="line_2250">But as for Milim—</p>
<p id="line_2251">As her eyes met with Frey’s, she began to panic. “EH! F-Frey? N-no, that’s not it at all. There’s an important reason for that—!”</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/illustrations/image7.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_2252"></p>
<p id="line_2253"><em>I mean… You’re done for, Milim.</em></p>
<p id="line_2254">I’m gonna put a disclaimer here. This whole incident had nothing to do with me—us—at all. <em>Right?</em></p>
<p id="line_2255">“Ha-hahaha, Milim, you should have told us that you had work to do. I won’t be keeping you waiting, go back now and finish the work early!”</p>
<p id="line_2256">“U-umm, that’s right. I’m so sorry to have kept you around for our research. You should have told us if you had work to do. It was our mistake to have asked for your cooperation, we have to apologize!”</p>
<p id="line_2257">“R-right! I mean, aren’t we close and all, Milim? You should have just said it, we wouldn’t have kept you around like this!”</p>
<p id="line_2258">Sensing what was happening, Veldora and Ramiris also verbalized their support.</p>
<p id="line_2259"><em>How very impressive. This was true teamwork here.</em></p>
<p id="line_2260">Now that we’d distanced ourselves from Milim, we were safe.</p>
<p id="line_2261">Milim looked at us with tears in her eyes. But all we could say was, “Sorry, the chances of you being saved seemed slim.”</p>
<p id="line_2262">Or rather, “Please don’t drag us down with you.”</p>
<p id="line_2263">“N-no, it’s not what it sounds like. H-hear me out, Frey!” she insisted, emphasizing her innocence to the very end. However, her defenses were futile in front of Frey’s fixed smile.</p>
<p id="line_2264">And so, Milim was captured by Frey. With Frey’s claws at her neck, Milim couldn’t fight back. In the end, Milim was dragged back to her kingdom.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2265">Phew, that was horrifying. We almost got dragged down with her as well. It looked like we made it through.</p>
<p id="line_2266">And just when I felt reassured—</p>
<p id="line_2267">“Speaking of which, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, where have you been and what have you been doing?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked harshly, suddenly appearing behind me.</p>
<p id="line_2268">Even though, in theory, I couldn’t sweat, I still felt the sensation of it flooding down my forehead.</p>
<p id="line_2269"><em>No, it was all right. We would be fine. We were definitely not playing. Research, yes! We were doing research this whole time.</em></p>
<p id="line_2270">After settling on my defense, I tried to excuse myself.</p>
<p id="line_2271">Yet Veldora spoke before I could: “Looks like we’re getting in the way here. I should go back to my room to indulge in the intricacies of sorcery. Sorcery is profound and worth studying—“ he muttered before taking out his manga and walking away.</p>
<p id="line_2272"><em>Is he trying to flee now?</em></p>
<p id="line_2273">I panicked as well, but it was too late.</p>
<p id="line_2274">Making up some nonsense excuse, even Ramiris betrayed me. “T-then I shall go too…”</p>
<p id="line_2275">Veldora and Ramiris teamed up and slipped away.</p>
<p id="line_2276"><em>What the hell are these two doing?! Why are they especially cooperative at times like this?</em></p>
<p id="line_2277">But I didn’t have time to think about these “great friends” of mine. If I didn’t come up with a good excuse, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s wrath would be terrifying. If I were to use any random excuse as filler, I could get myself killed here.</p>
<p id="line_2278">With how things had developed, I couldn’t really defend the position that we were just studying.</p>
<p id="line_2279">Seeing that Veldora and Ramiris had fled, all of my brain cells switched into overdrive to find the most appropriate answer. Yet, nothing good came up. However, this was no time to lose my nerve.

<p id="line_2281"><em>Please help me through these tough times with an awesome excuse</em>—I prayed to myself and asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei.</p>
<p id="line_2282">Its response was as follows.</p>
<p id="line_2283">«Answer. There is no need for an excuse. The problem can be resolved by being confident.»</p>
<p id="line_2284"><em>What? You say that there’s no need for any excuse? The problem could be resolved by being confident, what did that mean</em>—</p>
<p id="line_2285">Suddenly, someone ran into the office in a panic. “Ah, so there you are, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I’ve been looking for you!”</p>

<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2317">The council—the Western States Council—was made up of different nations surrounding the Great Jura Forest. The councilors elected by each nation would attend the meeting in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> every month. Strictly speaking, unlike councils run by nations, the main goal of the council is to maintain everyone’s financial interests.</p>
<p id="line_2318">They wouldn’t put smaller nations on lower priority, and instead start off from the point of equality. People would cooperate with each other. All of the members aimed to uphold the idea of defending the good of all humanity.</p>
<p id="line_2319">The good of man referred to maintaining the circle of survival for humans. Apart from taking care of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they also needed to handle droughts, plagues, typhoons and earthquakes. They had a duty to draft out plans to respond to crises.</p>
<p id="line_2320">Also, the policies on importing and exporting surplus food, specialties and other goods differed from nation to nation. Due to this reason, negotiation on these subjects became very difficult. Therefore, the council only discussed motions relating to actual rescue efforts.</p>
<p id="line_2321">If there was a famine, they would dispatch food to aid; if there was a large number of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they would send reinforcements to aid them, and so on.</p>
<p id="line_2322">It was not easy, and it would potentially lead to a series of problems as well.</p>
<p id="line_2323">The council was funded by each nation, and the proportion obviously would differ. The fund would fluctuate depending on the size and scale of the nations, yet at the same time, all nations shared the same privileges. This led to some dissatisfaction, and therefore, the number of councilors for different nations needed to be increased when more responsibility was undertaken.</p>
<p id="line_2324">However, with no restrictions to this rule, nations were no longer equal to each other. Thus, another rule was set. For every new councilor added to the council, their percentage of the emergency fund would also be raised accordingly.</p>
<p id="line_2325">However, with more councilors in place, it obviously implied greater influence. The larger nations had long realized this point, and would give away several times more money than they normally would just to have more power within the council.</p>
<p id="line_2326">As mentioned, the council’s actions were not directly related to national interests. However, it was still a convenient venue for the more powerful nations to show off their strength.</p>
<p id="line_2327">The more say a nation had in the council, the more likely they could turn things to the favor of their own nations. And in times of crises, they would also be able to protect their own nations first.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2328">Motions, such as the distribution of acquired funds, would be decided by majority votes within the council.</p>
<p id="line_2329">For example, let’s assume some highly dangerous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> have appeared.</p>
<p id="line_2330">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> under the command of the council would take on the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2331">The council would issue missions to eliminate the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and have the association hire adventurers. However, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would not appear alone.</p>
<p id="line_2332">What if these dangerous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were to appear simultaneously in several kingdoms?</p>
<p id="line_2333">Obviously, larger nations with greater authority would enjoy the privilege of receiving protection first and getting the better skilled adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_2334">That was only to be expected.</p>
<p id="line_2335">The fact alone that they offered greater funding contributions showed that they were of higher standing among the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_2336">People didn’t invest their limited resources to protect the useless. When they could afford it, they would help them, but if they couldn’t, they would be cut off—as it stood, the weak were simply abandoned. This was merely the reality played out as a game of numbers.</p>
<p id="line_2337">For that reason, the council did not tolerate council members delaying the payment of contributions, and had also drafted a minimum amount to be given. Inability to pay up was met with a swift eviction from the council.</p>
<p id="line_2338">For weaker nations, this meant that there would be no reinforcements in times of crisis.</p>
<p id="line_2339">The council had the duty to make these judgements. Hence, it was only natural for things to have developed this way due to the larger nations within the council having more authority.</p>
<p id="line_2340">That being said, these contributions were not cheap. They increased with the number of councilors sent by a nation. Even the kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which once had the largest number of councilors, could only send at most five. This made the destruction of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> a significant matter that the council could not ignore.</p>
<p id="line_2341">As they were about to make contact with the newly risen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, a more troubling issue came up—the rise of Tempest.</p>
<p id="line_2342">This naturally led to the council being shaken internally.</p>
<p id="line_2343">After the Tempest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the council held an emergency meeting.</p>
<p id="line_2344">It was pandemonium. The councilors argued in chaos.</p>

<p id="line_2349">The topic this time would provide vital information about the future of the Western Nations.

<p id="line_2350">She was rather repulsed by the council members that fell into disarray.</p>
<p id="line_2351"><em>So, this is how much chaos ensues after a bunch of useless tools gather in the same room…</em></p>
<p id="line_2352">When it came to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ own meetings, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was in charge of everything.

<p id="line_2353"><em>In worst case scenarios, I can always shut everyone up by force</em>—it had always been <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s policy to employ more practical means of persuasion in resolving issues during their own conferences.</p>
<p id="line_2354">She also attended the meeting in Tempest the other day.

<p id="line_2368">There were also the nations neighboring Tempest.</p>
<p id="line_2369">Some nations, on the other hand, felt threatened by other factors.</p>
<p id="line_2370">Others still were situated relatively safer in-land.</p>
<p id="line_2371">And due to these different geo-political predispositions, they all had different opinions as well.</p>
<p id="line_2372">The nations welcoming <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s nation were all neighbors to Tempest.

<p id="line_2373">It didn’t matter if Tempest was the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> kingdom. If it could benefit their own nations, it was welcome to stay—that was the stance of these nations.</p>
<p id="line_2374">On the opposite side of the spectrum, the nations that had other threats to deal with were uncertain about their decision. These nations were under the protection of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, therefore they had less problems caused by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. They only had a small army and didn’t want to make any reckless moves.</p>
<p id="line_2375">This was the same for every nation; it was already taxing enough to maintain their current status quo.</p>
<p id="line_2376">The sharper nations had already begun to strategize about how they could use Tempest to their own ends. However, some nations never participated in the nation’s founding festival. And some nations didn’t want to trust <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> from the get-go.</p>
<p id="line_2377">As they continued to argue, the weaker nations could only side with the majority.</p>
<p id="line_2378">As for the stronger nations and their vassals—they mostly agreed with Tempest’s addition. With their own safety in mind, they also considered how much profit they could gain as well.</p>
<p id="line_2379">Those who were skeptical towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s policies held the opposition. These people blindly believed that if anything were to happen, they would be the first to be attacked by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and thus, frantically opposed the decision.

<p id="line_2380">With such conflicts of interest, it was only natural that the council would be in turmoil.</p>
<p id="line_2381">If we were to take a step back and observe, there was nothing more idiotic than this. But with that being said, most councilors were merely trying to protect their own nation’s well-being.</p>

<p id="line_2387">“Yes, we all knew about this.”</p>
<p id="line_2388">The problems were mainly caused by councilors sent by the larger nations. They were already holding information that was not accessible to most. And with them fanning the flames of the already chaotic council meeting, it only made things messier.</p>
<p id="line_2389">Their goal, on the other hand, was plainly obvious. These people had already reached a conclusion and were simply luring everyone else onto that path. They were trying to make it seem natural.</p>
<p id="line_2390"><em>Those poor small nation councilors. They were forced to make a choice without even knowing. It’s no different than them forfeiting their votes…</em></p>
<p id="line_2391">Ignorance is a sin too, and not knowing the correct information would become a huge loss in itself.</p>
<p id="line_2392">The weak were tricked to forfeit their precious vote.</p>
<p id="line_2393">However—</p>
<p id="line_2394"><em>Since their conclusion was to allow <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to join the council, it’s exactly what I wanted.</em></p>
<p id="line_2395">The goal of the large nations aligned with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_2396">“What <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is planning doesn’t matter.

<p id="line_2397">“Indeed. We are all worried about the movement of ‘the East’ these days.

<p id="line_2398">It was then that one of the councilors of high-standing within the council, Johann Rostia, duke of the Kingdom of Rostia, suggested that the Eastern Empire was on the move.</p>
<p id="line_2399">“’The East’? Could you be referring to the Empire?”</p>
<p id="line_2400">“Do you mean they are on the move? But now, Veldora occupies the Great Jura Forest…”</p>
<p id="line_2401">Johann’s words caused an uproar among the councilors.</p>
<p id="line_2402">And soon enough, all the attention in the room was on Johann alone.</p>
<p id="line_2403"><em>Now we’ve gone down to the real business</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought.</p>
<p id="line_2404">It was all too typical of noblemen to hold lengthy preambles before addressing the heart of the matter. They would first beat around the bush with each other to probe what information others held, and how deep that understanding was. Once they were convinced of having the upper hand, they would show their true colors. This was how they operated.</p>
<p id="line_2405">And following this exact playbook, Johann had managed to dominate the scene.</p>
<p id="line_2406">“As you are all aware, the Eastern Empire—the Eastern Sovereign Alliance of the Nasca Namrium Ulmeria Empire’s military units have moved out recently. According to reports by the merchants coming out of the area, they have been actively conducting military drills.”</p>
<p id="line_2407">Johann’s words calmed the hall down immediately.</p>
<p id="line_2408"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> knew about this as well.

<p id="line_2409">They probably were learning about the Empire’s movement via the dealing of healing potions and equipment. The Dwarven Kingdom was a neutral nation. King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must have kept silent in order to maintain their neutrality.

<p id="line_2410">The proof was the technology he showcased during the nation’s founding festival. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was playing dumb and said that “This was just the result of their liberal research,” but that was not the case in reality.</p>
<p id="line_2411">It was probably a threat to King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p id="line_2417">Everyone was waiting for Johann to continue, having experienced such shock. They wanted to gather sufficient information so that they could plan and protect their nations.</p>
<p id="line_2418">It may be the case for large nations with military reserves, but for smaller nations that couldn’t spare the expense to train an army, they didn’t have a large army.</p>
<p id="line_2419">Hiring mercenaries during wartime was not uncommon, but if all of the nations were to begin stockpiling their war effort at the same time, there wouldn’t be enough soldiers to go around.</p>
<p id="line_2420">“Everyone, please calm down. The Empire won’t strike anytime soon. We need to discuss this calmly and strategize!” Johann announced.</p>

<p id="line_2422">“Then, what do you suggest we do?” one of the councilors asked, followed by many.</p>

<p id="line_2425">“Calm down! The reason why the Empire has held back all this time was entirely thanks to that beast lurking within the Great Jura Forest. It may be a different case if it were sealed again. Thank god for its resurrection!”</p>

<p id="line_2431">“That does seem to be the case…”</p>
<p id="line_2432">After hearing Johann’s statement, the crowd began to gradually agree with his sentiment.</p>
<p id="line_2433">This seemed to cheer him up greatly.

<p id="line_2434">Johann announced this conclusion solemnly, saying it in a tone almost as if testing everyone’s reaction.</p>
<p id="line_2435">This line alone was enough to change the atmosphere of the council.</p>

Even though Tempest was a kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it was still a negotiable partner where human common sense prevailed.</p>
<p id="line_2437">On the other hand, the Empire was the greedy enemy attempting to devour all. It was because they were all humans, that the people foresaw the inevitable failure and fate of being vassalized, were they to fight against the Empire.</p>
<p id="line_2438">The ruling class would all be killed—that’s most likely what awaited them.</p>
<p id="line_2439">The Empire was an enormous military nation. Reviewing its history, they had swallowed up countless nations and prospered off of it. They have never shown mercy to their oppositions, that was why the Western Nations were all afraid of them.</p>
<p id="line_2440">“Umm, councilor Johann has a point. I agree with his view.”</p>
<p id="line_2441">“Oh oh, so you understand my concern, councilor <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gavan" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!

What are all of your thoughts on the matter?”</p>
<p id="line_2442">“Very well. First us Western Nations must unite.”</p>
<p id="line_2443">“Indeed. Now is not the time for us to fight amongst ourselves!”</p>
<p id="line_2444">Several senators voiced their approval for Johann’s proposition. Now that things were heading in the intended direction, the speaker of the council shouted: “Silence!”</p>
<p id="line_2445">As the speaker passed the motion, everyone began to vote.</p>
<p id="line_2446">First, they riled up people’s fear, then they pressured them with their common alliance. That really did seem like methods that noblemen would use, how clever.</p>
<p id="line_2447"><em>Could this be part of their plan? Speaking of which, it did take considerably long before they cut to the chase…</em></p>
<p id="line_2448">It was obvious that Johann and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gavan" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were in on this together, and there were other people who were supporting their ploy as well. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as a by-stander to the situation, didn’t have the right to vote.

<p id="line_2449">All of this chaos was scripted, and now <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was inwardly relieved to know that it was finally over.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2450">It had been eight hours since the start of the meeting. Even though there was an intermission to rest, the fatigue continued to accumulate, nonetheless.

<p id="line_2452">At the end of the day, that was the reason why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was summoned in the first place.</p>

<p id="line_2454">It was simply the noble’s way of dealing, to intentionally complicate things.</p>
<p id="line_2455">Much like how the Empire was seemingly stirring, but their intention was simply to generate fear. Perhaps they were really preparing something, but the act alone was purely demonstrative. After all, in order to invade the Western Nations, the Empire would first need to overcome a number of obstacles.</p>
<p id="line_2456">A few of them were the Great Jura Forest and Armored Nation Dwargon.</p>
<p id="line_2457">It might have been a different case had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> not allied with Dwargon, but considering the current circumstances, even the Empire would not dare to make a move without making proper preparations.</p>

That way, Veldora wouldn’t have gotten revived, either. The Empire had its chance to rule the world…</em></p>
<p id="line_2459">Out of fear that they would break the seal on Veldora, the Empire dared not to make a move.</p>
<p id="line_2460">Even with Veldora’s presence off the radar, they were still very cautious and didn’t act on it.</p>
<p id="line_2461">And now, they no longer had a chance to do so.</p>

<p id="line_2464">The result of the poll, naturally, showed a majority support towards the motion, agreeing to allow Tempest to join the council.</p>

<p id="line_2541">Momiji had taken <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to visit the hidden tengu village.</p>

<p id="line_2543">He had spent countless days researching lately, making it easy to forget that he was also an outstanding warrior trusted by his subordinates. Hopefully his test would go well. I was looking forward to the results. I’d reward him once he succeeded.</p>
<p id="line_2544">Just like that, my lieutenants had been hard at work.</p>
<p id="line_2545">This was why only the three of us were visiting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2546">The first place we visited was the clothing store.</p>
<p id="line_2547">Just like in modern Japan, there were all sorts of clothes on display inside glass cabinets and some passersby viewed the items as they walked past. It was a testament to how urban the capital of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was.</p>
<p id="line_2548">These windows were all insanely expensive. Despite glass wares being commonplace on the market, buying a single glass pane of this size would set you back as much as a run-down house. And given how the stores used them for their displays, it was a clear sign that their businesses were very profitable.</p>
<p id="line_2549">This was what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> taught me, though I could easily confirm such an idea from the number of customers alone.</p>
<p id="line_2550">By the way, our nation also adopted window displays. After I told everyone what I saw in the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the other female members begged me to import them. I couldn’t come up with a reason to refuse them, so I talked to Mildo and had him handle the production of the glass. With the amazing assistance from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, the production of the display windows came into fruition smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_2551">Putting that aside, the reason why we came here first was due to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s demands. Propped up in the window displays were the latest fashion trends. She was observing them with great interest.</p>
<p id="line_2552">They truly were gorgeous.</p>
<p id="line_2553">We perused all kinds of shops and found many clothes with special designs that our nation didn’t have. The clothes made by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others were mostly based on my personal memories. But the place here was full of clothes designed by the artisans themselves. The items all had their own charms.</p>
<p id="line_2554">They were enough to have completely mesmerized <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2555">“I’m not gonna be defeated like this, I will refine my skill even more—!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> muttered, filled with determination.</p>
<p id="line_2556">“I’ll be counting on you in the future! Then, everyone, please help yourself to any clothes of your liking. I’ll pay.”</p>
<p id="line_2557">“Eh! R-really?”</p>
<p id="line_2558">“I can choose as well?”</p>
<p id="line_2559">“…I’m fine with my outfit.”</p>
<p id="line_2560">“Don’t be so formal now! I haven’t been paying you guys any salary. At least allow me to treat you in times like this.”</p>
<p id="line_2561">As a token of appreciation for the care they had given me every day, I decided to buy them some clothes. Even though we had specially prepared suits for tomorrow’s meeting, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would still be wearing their combat outfits. Adventurers would be on site during the meeting as well, so they couldn’t really be blamed for their attire. But their outfits were still too eye-catching for wandering in the street. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also wearing her miko outfit, to which I had no issue if she were to have another pretty casual outfit.</p>
<p id="line_2562">Which was why I told everyone to pick their clothes.</p>
<p id="line_2563"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> picked two sets of tailor-made jackets and shirts, with skinny jeans to go along with it.</p>
<p id="line_2564"><em>Very naisu, very naisu. It’s a great fit for their style.</em></p>
<p id="line_2565"><em>On the other hand, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—OH OH!</em></p>
<p id="line_2566">She picked a soft white pantskirt with an icy-blue knitted vest.</p>
<p id="line_2567">How cute, it suited her perfectly!</p>
<p id="line_2568">“This looks great, it suits you perfectly, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_2569">“Thank you for your compliment! I’m so happy, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_2570"><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p id="line_2571">Seriously, while her miko outfit was amazing, this type of casual outfit looked great as well. It was rare to see her dressed this way, so it was very refreshing. This was a rare opportunity, so I had her choose a couple different outfits and bought all of them. Surely, she would be able to tailor more clothes based on these outfits.</p>
<p id="line_2572">I also chose a pale-blue jumpsuit as a gift for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That gal looked like an ice-cold beauty from the outside, I’m sure she will be able to wear this outfit to its fullest.</p>
<p id="line_2573">“She will definitely be overjoyed!”</p>
<p id="line_2574">“Will she now?”</p>
<p id="line_2575">Then I’m happy as well.</p>
<p id="line_2576">“Yes, definitely.”</p>
<p id="line_2577">Surely, it would be the case if even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said so.</p>
<p id="line_2578">“You two looked great in your outfits as well, let’s buy all of them.”</p>
<p id="line_2579">“Don’t have any more words to spare on us?”</p>
<p id="line_2580">“—Indeed.”</p>
<p id="line_2581"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to complain, but I ignored them.</p>
<p id="line_2582"><em>Are you two implying that you want to choose more?</em></p>
<p id="line_2583">Their tone gave the impression that they were completely disinterested, yet they still scoured the selection of clothes with great enthusiasm. Handsome people look good in any clothes, so there’s really no need for you guys to worry.</p>
<p id="line_2584">I, on the other hand, came to a quick decision. I couldn’t tell the difference between good and bad clothes no matter how much I worried about it, so I asked the staff of the shop to help pick out clothes for me. Their choices would be undoubtedly reliable.</p>
<p id="line_2585">And so, we each picked out our clothes. The size measurements were done on the spot, and we changed into our new clothes immediately.</p>
<p id="line_2586"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had a big smile on her face as she held the bag of clothes I bought her like a treasure. Unlike my secretary-in-name <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> always worked very hard. To see this different side of her did bring a smile to my face.</p>
<p id="line_2587"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also seemed happy after changing into their new clothes.</p>
<p id="line_2588">Everyone looked happy about this, how wonderful.</p>
<p id="line_2589">These people had always been hard at work, I wanted to reward them to show my appreciation. Seeing how overjoyed they all were, perhaps I should have come here sooner.</p>
<p id="line_2590">On that note, I paid the bill.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2591">After changing our outfits, we visited the cafe run by Yoshida-san. Nowadays, the cafe was run by his disciple. Business was very good. Since the ingredients they used were exported from our nation, we could buy the products they sold at a discounted price.</p>
<p id="line_2592">We were waiting for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was also coming to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Apart from the lunch I was looking forward to enjoying in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would also brief us in detail about the meeting being held tomorrow.</p>
<p id="line_2593">During that period, I acquired some of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s information. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been keeping tabs on what was going on in the Western Nations, so I thought he might know about the reason we were invited this time.</p>
<p id="line_2594">“Then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’ll trouble you to do the report.”</p>
<p id="line_2595">“Very well. Then I shall start with the feedback on the nation-founding festival—”</p>
<p id="line_2596">As he finished, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to report the important bits of information from the local rumors and gossip.</p>
<p id="line_2597">The report was easily understood, and I was very satisfied.</p>
<p id="line_2598">The feedback on the founding festival had been glowing. From noblemen to common peasants, everyone was talking about it.</p>
<p id="line_2599">Speaking of rumors, the dungeon was mentioned frequently as well. The promotion we did towards the nobles worked like a charm. I heard that some were even forming teams of participants to challenge the labyrinth. Not only was this the case for residents near our nation, even in distant kingdoms, the interest was growing.</p>
<p id="line_2600">At this rate, the number of challengers would keep climbing.</p>
<p id="line_2601">And with that, after finishing the more enjoyable topic, we decided to discuss the more important matter.</p>
<p id="line_2602">“Then, tell us about the result of the investigations on those merchants, as well as the connections Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had behind him?”</p>
<p id="line_2603">“I’ve investigated them all, ran a thorough search on the family members and the trade partners of the merchants. The results show that they have not been in contact with any suspicious individuals of late. However, they did seem to share common benefactors when they were applying for the business license. After doing some research on the officers who helped these merchants, we discovered that they were all connected to Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_2604"><em>…And, what does that mean?</em></p>
<p id="line_2605">«Answer.

<p id="line_2606">I see. So no more important information would be revealed even if we were to continue investigating these merchants.</p>
<p id="line_2607"><em>But what about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?</em></p>
<p id="line_2608">Perhaps there really was a shadow committee running the Western Nations. There was a possibility that they were planning for something. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed like a competent individual, we should probably continue surveilling the person.</p>
<p id="line_2609">“So, I’ve heard that Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s a cunning one, what happened to this pesky guy?”</p>
<p id="line_2610">No matter how cunning he was, he couldn’t run from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s watchful eye.

<p id="line_2611">But just as I was thinking about it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> spilled a shocking fact.</p>
<p id="line_2612">“He’s dead.”</p>
<p id="line_2613">“Ah?”</p>
<p id="line_2614">“I suspect the cause of death was a ranged attack.”</p>

<p id="line_2616">Moreover, if they really went to such lengths to cover their tracks, our opponent must’ve held tremendous power.</p>

<p id="line_2660"><em>How should I put this; I feel hurt.</em></p>
<p id="line_2661">This outfit was very comfortable and I didn’t really dislike it. But speaking of which, that was not the point. The thing was my dandy-like appearance now…</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2664">Right.</p>
<p id="line_2665">The way I looked right now, I couldn’t suggest the slightest bit of mature charm. I didn’t understand why I was concerned about my height now, even though I used to be an adult. Perhaps I should just come to terms with reality.</p>
<p id="line_2666">By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hadn’t dressed up beautifully like during the festival.

<p id="line_2668">Whatever the case, I wasn’t bold enough to say that out loud. Although I felt it was very difficult to let go of the matter, we went back to our previous topic.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2669">While mourning the loss of Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we began to investigate the circumstances of his murder.</p>
<p id="line_2670">“You mentioned that there are pistols in this world, so was he really killed by a sniper?”</p>
<p id="line_2671">“I’m not sure about the details regarding that, but a pistol doesn’t even have an effective range of fifty meters, right?”</p>
<p id="line_2672">That seemed to be the case.</p>
<p id="line_2673">Surely, one would need a rifle in order to launch such a long-distance attack.</p>
<p id="line_2674">“Are there sniper rifles in this world then?”</p>
<p id="line_2675">“Beats me, I’ve never seen one, but I can’t conclude that there aren’t any.”</p>
<p id="line_2676">I suppose.</p>
<p id="line_2677">It was best to assume that sniper rifles existed in this world and act accordingly. And so, I transferred the concept of firearms through ‘Telepathy Net’ to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others.</p>
<p id="line_2678">“Oh, so there’s this type of weapon.”</p>
<p id="line_2679">“I see, if this was utilized, I naturally would not have noticed.”</p>
<p id="line_2680">“Perhaps I can use this as well. It shouldn’t be a problem to research gunpowder, and the gun itself can be made by Dold-san.”</p>
<p id="line_2681">I got three different responses from three different people.</p>
<p id="line_2682">In <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s view, this type of weapon shouldn’t even be considered as a threat.</p>
<p id="line_2683">But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> feared a repeat of his last mission’s failure, and the inability to ensure the safety of his target. For his type of missions, he seemed to consider guns a threat.</p>
<p id="line_2684">On the other side of this, we had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Her idea was to make the most dangerous gun… We could indeed make one, but what would be the consequences of doing so?</p>
<p id="line_2685">The production of firearms marked a dramatic shift in the way that wars were fought—that being said, this world adhered to quality over quantity in a lot of cases when it came to strategic design. Still, adding guns to our arsenal seemed very dangerous, we were better off not developing them just yet.</p>
<p id="line_2686">“In any case, in another world, this weapon’s ferocity granted enough power to allow normally fragile people to dominate those around them. While I don’t know how useful it will be in this world, it should be effective against magical beasts and the like of them.”</p>
<p id="line_2687">“A gun can run out of ammo, but not mana. The higher the caliber, the more powerful the guns are, and the greater the number, the more threatening it is. For these reasons, I hope that your nation will not mass produce them.”</p>
<p id="line_2688"><em>Indeed, it’s definitely viable.</em></p>
<p id="line_2689"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had thrown in her two cents.</p>
<p id="line_2690">“Right, we’ll see about it. I think magic is stronger, but an average person wielding a firearm is equally dangerous.”</p>
<p id="line_2691">Japan did not have a gun society, therefore such a feeling was even stronger for me. Unlike what foreign news claimed about being able to protect yourself by owning a gun, I believed that such incidents probably wouldn’t happen if no one owned guns anyway. Upon thinking so, it indeed felt very dangerous to spread such dangerous weapons to everyone.</p>
<p id="line_2692">“Okay, then I shall keep it strictly as research.”</p>
<p id="line_2693"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> accepted that, which was reassuring.</p>
<p id="line_2694">However, even though it was generally considered as a threat, it shouldn’t be able to harm us at all. Did we really need to give it such high regard?</p>
<p id="line_2695">«Report. To individuals with insufficient amounts of information, if they were to witness someone being gunned down in front of them, they wouldn’t understand what happened. It is highly likely that the people around the deceased would be considered suspects.»</p>

It meant that if someone next to me were to be assassinated, people would start to suspect me.</p>
<p id="line_2698">After hearing so, it was indeed the case.</p>
<p id="line_2699">Since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was already close to me, even her testimony would likely be rejected. If the criminal ran away without leaving behind any murder weapon, I would likely be the one held accountable.</p>
<p id="line_2700">How dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_2701">Had I not discussed this with someone beforehand, I would have fallen for it.

<p id="line_2702">“Anyway, we best be careful during tomorrow’s meeting.”</p>
<p id="line_2703">“Wouldn’t we just feel a pinch after being hit by a lead bullet without mana? We shouldn’t be so careful about it.”</p>
<p id="line_2704">“No, that’s not discreet enough.

There may even be something like a magic bullet. Moreover, if someone gets hit by one during the middle of the meeting, I will probably be the number one suspect.”</p>
<p id="line_2705">“I’m worried about that too. I will be deploying my ‘Clones’ around the meeting ground and be extra careful.”</p>
<p id="line_2706">As expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he already thought of so without me bringing it up.</p>
<p id="line_2707">“Umm, I’ll be counting on you!”</p>
<p id="line_2708">“Yes sir.”</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_2710">Now that I had been reassured, it was time to get to the main issue.</p>

<p id="line_2712">I still hadn’t been informed what we would be discussing in tomorrow’s meeting. But I could predict it.</p>
<p id="line_2713">Perhaps it would be about a certain dragon running loose somewhere, or the sighting of a mysterious <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—Ramiris and Veldora’s predictions were absolutely idiotic. That couldn’t have been the reason. The topic of the meeting had to be about whether or not they should allow our nation to join the council.</p>
<p id="line_2714">It appeared that we would be treated as the nation’s guest this time. I looked forward to good news at the meeting.</p>
<p id="line_2715">“During the last temporary meeting, they agreed to let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> join the council. During tomorrow’s meeting, they plan to question you first before making the official verdict.”</p>
<p id="line_2716">Bingo!</p>
<p id="line_2717">Those two idiots were mostly oblivious of the situation and made nonsense predictions. It was correct of me to have ignored them.</p>
<p id="line_2718">“I see, as expected,” I nodded, pretending that I had been aware of the situation the whole time. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked at me somewhat doubtfully.</p>

<p id="line_2756">“Could you tell me the reason?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked me, looking very concerned.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2757">This guy was, as usual, serious when it came to work. To reassure <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I decided to give him the conclusion deduced by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2758">“Hmm, first of all, the most important thing is that we must think in the Empire’s perspective. Assuming the Empire was to invade the Western Nations, what type of strategy would they employ—?”</p>
<p id="line_2759">Essentially, the key lay in the motive behind their invasion. But that was an issue for another time. If they were to go to war, the most important step was to choose how they would invade.</p>
<p id="line_2760">They would need to cross the Great Jura Forest.</p>
<p id="line_2761">Or cross the steep mountain roads of the Canaat Mountains.</p>
<p id="line_2762">Their last option was to take the sea route, which aligned with the old trade route we used before we constructed our roads.</p>
<p id="line_2763">While it also depended on the size and scale of the Empire’s expedition army, either route would pose problems.</p>
<p id="line_2764">The sea route would be challenging. Distance-wise it could lead them to the Kingdom of Blumund. While it was safe travelling near the coast, if you went too far into deeper waters, you would run into the nests of large sea <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that were over rank A. Even if they were to navigate through them with a large fleet of ships, safety could not be guaranteed.</p>
<p id="line_2765">Even the tasty spear tuna was extremely dangerous in the sea. It could travel and attack at a speed of sixty knots—equivalent of thirty meters per second. This <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could create giant holes in a ship.</p>
<p id="line_2766">Moreover, don’t just think that you could ensure safety on a steel-armored ship. Because among the many giant sea <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the spear tuna was considered merely a third-rate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2767">A kraken might not be particularly intelligent, but it was rumored that their attack instincts against people invading their domain was very strong. If a ship were to be struck by its over ten meter long body, no battleship would be able to escape the fate of sinking.</p>
<p id="line_2768">Only traders who knew the sea route well would consider travelling by sea.</p>
<p id="line_2769">Then perhaps the mountain route would be preferable—but, near the Canaat Mountains, there was a hostile area called the den of dragons. If it were only a caravan, the dragons would probably close one eye. But if a large number of people were to approach, that would provoke the dragons. They were not humans, so it was impossible to negotiate. If the dragons thought that the visitors had harmful intent towards them, that would be their end.</p>
<p id="line_2770">The dragon clan were led by the prideful dragon lords. If the dragons decided to target them, the Eastern Empire’s army would already be half-dead before they could start a war against the Western Nations. That was if they won, however. It’d be absolutely hilarious if they were to lose.</p>
<p id="line_2771">Moreover, after defeating the dragons, they would have to face the Western Nations themselves, which from there on would be the start of the actual war.</p>
<p id="line_2772">The military operation of traversing the steep mountains would give them hell already. And it will also depend on the time period. They could only pass during the short summer period. During wintertime, the mountains would be sealed by extreme weather and snow, which was difficult to overcome even with magic.</p>
<p id="line_2773">Normally speaking, the army would avoid marching in this route.</p>
<p id="line_2774">In the end, this left only the Great Jura Forest route to be viable.</p>
<p id="line_2775">But that wasn’t very simple either.</p>
<p id="line_2776">“Now I, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, run the Great Jura Forest. Moreover, there’s also Veldora.”</p>
<p id="line_2777">“Indeed, we have circulated rumors that Veldora-sama has been revived. And now even the Empire would not dare to take a move without much consideration. They were already afraid of a sealed Veldora-sama, so they wouldn’t begin to know what to do now.”</p>
<p id="line_2778">Indeed, it was.</p>
<p id="line_2779">We had spread the rumors that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> army was wiped out by Veldora. Surely, the Empire heard this news as well, and its ambitions would be set back as a result. After all, for the longest time, the Empire had always been afraid of Veldora. That was why they had acted with extreme caution. Had they acted sooner, we possibly would have been devastated already.</p>
<p id="line_2780">But now we had Veldora at our back, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san therefore could conclude confidently that there was no reason for concern.</p>
<p id="line_2781">«Report. Not concluding, predicting. Situations change every day. With every additional piece of new information, new considerations will be added, and the situation must be reevaluated.»</p>

But it had a point.</p>
<p id="line_2783">If we were to rely on such biased views, we might find ourselves in a huge set up later.</p>
<p id="line_2784">“The Empire is indeed acting weird. Perhaps my ‘Shadows’ were not competent enough. I wanted to investigate myself, it’s just that…”</p>

<p id="line_2789">Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had evolved, he could only send out six ‘Clones’ at the same time.

<p id="line_2790">“The Empire’s intentions are really not that important.

<p id="line_2813">But whether I actually took her advice was a different matter.</p>
<p id="line_2814">“What do you mean? Are we going to get manipulated?”</p>
<p id="line_2815">“Yes, perhaps in terms of the military. But regarding that, I actually agree, wouldn’t it be in your interest as well?”</p>
<p id="line_2816">There would be conditions for joining the council. They seemed to want to toss us the job of managing everything in the Great Jura Forest. We’d also act as the buffer for defending against the Empire. That seemed to be every nation’s wish.</p>
<p id="line_2817">“No problem. With the number of wild <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decreasing, there will be more people coming to the labyrinth. That’s just what we want.”</p>
<p id="line_2818">“Don’t be too idealistic. The order has seen first-hand how many scheming old foxes are in the council. They may order you to dispatch soldiers to their nations in order to suppress the threat of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_2819">Normally speaking, no one wanted a foreign army in their land. But with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> being a thing in this world, they were the common enemies of all humans. Therefore, it was only natural for everyone to try and reserve sufficient military forces.</p>
<p id="line_2820">It was just like the Templar Knight Order of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Many nations would go so far as to employ other nations’ armies.</p>
<p id="line_2821">«Proposal. We can utilize this opportunity to offer them military force as a favor.»</p>
<p id="line_2822">So not only could we have the council acknowledge us as a nation, but we could even send our army directly to other nations with proper justification? If that were the case, if any backlash were to ensue, we could use the military force to show them what’s good.</p>
<p id="line_2823">My homeland Japan used to do this as well.</p>
<p id="line_2824">“Oh, oh, I see. Why not? Let them have it then.”</p>
<p id="line_2825">“But it does kind of piss me off to know that they are exploiting us.”</p>
<p id="line_2826">“But wouldn’t that actually greatly increase our influence?”</p>
<p id="line_2827">I gave an evil grin, to which <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> immediately understood my meaning. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smiled without saying anything. I suppose that meant that she agreed as well. There was no objection.</p>
<p id="line_2828">In other words, we’d act according to my will tomorrow.</p>
<p id="line_2829">“Your expression looked super evil just now.” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked at me, almost dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2830">She seemed to see through our thoughts. But she didn’t say anything more. In other words, she approved. And so, our talk ended.</p>
<p id="line_2831">Before leaving, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suddenly recalled something and said this: “By the way, there were a bunch of idiots who were up to no good. Don’t you get careless now.” It was a cautious reminder, telling me not to get angry and lose control.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2832">The council was divided. She was probably telling me not to judge everyone by a glimpse of what I would see.</p>
<p id="line_2833"><em>Seriously. Why are you so worried about a pacifist like me?</em></p>
<p id="line_2834">I knew what to do even if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hadn’t reminded me. My answer to her was, “You are worrying too much,” then we bid farewell to her.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2835">The night passed and the day of the conference was afoot.</p>
<p id="line_2836">We headed to the venue. It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I. Everyone put on their respective outfits, all looking dashing. And of course, all of our weapons were stored in my ‘Stomach.’ On the surface, we would appear unarmed.</p>
<p id="line_2837">I had not the slightest sense of unease, having obtained much information from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> beforehand. Someone seemed to want to exploit our nation. But that wouldn’t pose an issue for us joining the council.</p>
<p id="line_2838">If this allowed them to acknowledge us as a part of humanity, it would be one step closer to building the ideal society in my head. To form a relationship where both men and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> can prosper and build a world on top of that. Quoting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myuran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it would be a circle of common prosperity for men and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2839">On the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> side, we’d already established such a relationship among <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, dwarves, elves and many other races. This alone created a huge economic circle, but I was a human once myself, that’s why I wanted to prosper along with humans.</p>
<p id="line_2840">However, humans were greedy. Unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they cared too much about gains and losses and were naturally xenophobic. But at the same time, because of their greed, their standards of living had been raised as a result. That was an undeniable fact. They have also become the source of power that pushed forward the entertainment industry across the world.</p>
<p id="line_2841">Unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, humans weren’t simple beings. Humans were complex.</p>
<p id="line_2842">I probably shouldn’t have high hopes and expect that everything would go smoothly from the get-go.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2843">When we arrived at the venue, a number of councilors had already been waiting for some time. They began to greet us. They all seemed to come from nations that neighbored ours. Or perhaps they had heard things from the participants of the founding festival, which prompted them to come and establish some friendly relations with us.</p>
<p id="line_2844">I was very happy to hear how they praised our men.</p>
<p id="line_2845">As I responded kindly to their proposals for the future, they seemed to be reassured and began to smile.</p>
<p id="line_2846">“Wahahaha, I’ve heard that Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I never imagined you were so easy-going!”</p>
<p id="line_2847">“Let us continue our friendship in the future!”</p>
<p id="line_2848">“You are all too kind, this is my wish as well. In the future we will be holding events once in a while, as well. For those who are interested, do come and join us.”</p>
<p id="line_2849">During the festival, many people were still very afraid of us. But now they had warmed up and were willing to have discourse with us. This was all thanks to Rigurd, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others’ diligent efforts.</p>
<p id="line_2850">Because of this, I was cheered up greatly.</p>
<p id="line_2851">And even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> warned me a ton beforehand, by the current look of this, there really wasn’t any need for me to worry.</p>
<p id="line_2852">But just as I thought so, my mood was suddenly turned with the arrival of the next group of people.</p>
<p id="line_2853">“Hmph! You lot, stop troubling <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono so much. Bunch of petty small nation scrubs with no real substance. What gave you the confidence to have spoken with him for so long?”</p>
<p id="line_2854">“Hah, that’s right. What a rude bunch, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono might get the wrong impression of the council. Know your place and beat it already.”</p>
<p id="line_2855">And just like that, a group of arrogant councilors showed up and chased away the people who were chatting with me.</p>
<p id="line_2856"><em>Who’s the rude one!</em> I really wanted to say that, but I managed to hold myself back.</p>
<p id="line_2857"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had informed me via ‘Telepathy Net’ that the people who had just arrived had a rather powerful nation supporting them.</p>
<p id="line_2858">The council claimed that all councilors were equal, but it seemed that these people weren’t exactly abiding by that rule. These people also saw their actions as justified, seemingly not feeling any guilt for their actions at all.</p>
<p id="line_2859">There was indeed a class difference as the result of their identities.</p>
<p id="line_2860">“Good day to you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, chatting with those people surely couldn’t have been constructive.”</p>
<p id="line_2861">“Good day to you too, what constructive topic were you referring to?”</p>
<p id="line_2862">While I didn’t really want to talk with these people, I still decided to cooperate and give him some room to back off.</p>
<p id="line_2863">“My, my, don’t beat around the bush now, how would <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono understand if you put it that way!”</p>
<p id="line_2864">“Hahaha, you have a point. I see that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono is unfortunately devoid of noble etiquette. Then allow us to teach you in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_2865">I merely replied out of courtesy, yet their responses had sounded really malicious. To be honest, these people’s attitudes were way too natural, it’s hard to tell if they really had ill intent or not. At the same time, they also seemed a bit too casual around me. I suppose it was better than them being afraid of me…right?</p>
<p id="line_2866">“By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, I heard that you were building some interesting things?”</p>
<p id="line_2867">“Indeed, I heard that you were developing something called a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? We totally would approve if you would export this item to our nation!”</p>
<p id="line_2868">“Yes, that’s our thought exactly. We can give you our aid, but of course, for a price—but it would seem inappropriate to continue.”</p>
<p id="line_2869">Hmm, huh?</p>
<p id="line_2870">How should I put this; I was a bit astonished?</p>
<p id="line_2871">That was way beyond just ‘rude’!</p>
<p id="line_2872">I was thinking that I should act with a bit of humility since these were nobles that I was dealing with. However, it seemed that I had miscalculated. They’d had a huge misunderstanding because of how I’ve handled this.</p>
<p id="line_2873">But this was their domain, after all. If I didn’t play nice enough, things might turn problematic. I shall forgive them with my big heart. Since I’d promised <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with confidence, I couldn’t get angry at this point.</p>
<p id="line_2874">“The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> can’t be used without laying down the tracks first. Moreover, all of the construction plans have been pre-planned, so we can’t exactly export them just because there are demands.”</p>
<p id="line_2875">“Oh, never mind such details. I have already informed my home nation about it; all you need to do is to allow us to import the merchandise.”</p>
<p id="line_2876">Looks like they hadn’t even seen the actual thing and misunderstood.</p>
<p id="line_2877">They didn’t even seem to know what a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was, so our conversation had been completely pointless. Moreover, they were giving us demands one-sidedly without even considering our opinion.</p>
<p id="line_2878">But I still chose to endure this time.</p>
<p id="line_2879">“No, no, no! I’ve already told you, there are sequences to—”</p>
<p id="line_2880">I suppressed my inner rage and tried to refuse them, but these people didn’t know when to stop with their demands.</p>
<p id="line_2881">“Then we wouldn’t mind switching to a different merchandise. We would love to purchase a large quantity of weapons and armor, so please help us arrange it. And of course, don’t forget to show some appreciation when the transaction is completed.”</p>
<p id="line_2882">Among the noblemen, the man with a big beard representing the duchy of Laquia was especially annoying. He seemed to have even implied that we should bribe them. I seriously questioned whether he had forgotten the fact that I was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2883">The nations neighboring the Great Jura Forest were subjected to the threats of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, while the nations located in the in-land of the continent enjoyed peace and prosperity. It must have been because of the riches of these nations that they didn’t consider the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s a threat…</p>
<p id="line_2884">But I must say, these people were <em>really</em> annoying. The fact that I’d been trying to respond to them seriously made me look like an idiot.</p>
<p id="line_2885">“By the way, how did you educate that person called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? My contact went to deal trades with him, yet he has been pending without any response. Is it possible to change the correspondent?”</p>
<p id="line_2886"><em>You are really, really annoying, you know?!</em> I really wanted to yell this at him.</p>
<p id="line_2887">So <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had been dealing with this type of people all this time. He must have had plenty of hardship hiding this behind my back. Even though he seemed to have handled them with ease, surely it was still very annoying to deal with.</p>
<p id="line_2888">I gotta learn more from him in the future.</p>
<p id="line_2889">“I will handle this properly.”</p>
<p id="line_2890">Apart from saying so, I also gave them a smile.</p>
<p id="line_2891">Japanese was a very beautiful language.</p>
<p id="line_2892">Handle it properly—apart from what this line meant literally, there were no deadlines as to when the matter would be done. I never commented about how soon I’d handle the situation. It was the equivalent of me not promising anything.</p>
<p id="line_2893">This was a neat trick often used by the super elite—Japanese Bureaucrats. Now I could play dumb and make it through, as well as refuting this whole ordeal. What an excellent strategy.</p>
<p id="line_2894">“Oh, oh, that’s certainly reassuring to hear!”</p>
<p id="line_2895">“We will be looking forward to it.”</p>
<p id="line_2896">“Then, please allow us to excuse ourselves.”</p>
<p id="line_2897">“Regarding the merchandise, we can provide you aid at any time, please feel free to ask.”</p>
<p id="line_2898">“Looking forward to our future interactions.”</p>
<p id="line_2899">Completely fooled by my words, those idiots left with satisfied smiles.</p>
<p id="line_2900"><em>Now that was a mature response.</em></p>
<p id="line_2901">If you want to buy it, just come and buy it yourselves.</p>
<p id="line_2902">“Indeed, we will be in your care when that time comes.”</p>
<p id="line_2903">I replied with some disingenuous lines and saw these councilors off.</p>
<p id="line_2904">What a troubling bunch.</p>
<p id="line_2905">There was no need to sell our goods to these guys, it was much more pragmatic to sell them through the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. There were even more benefits, and the fact that the Association hadn’t told us to bribe them was a definite win for us.</p>
<p id="line_2906">The other councilors began to close in on me, but I only greeted them briefly before leaving. Chatting too long with them may lead to some unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p id="line_2907">My mood had already been ruined this early into the morning. But I suppose that’s an experience as well.</p>
<p id="line_2908">Had there been a problem before the meeting even started, there was no telling just how much <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would scold me afterward.

<p id="line_2910">It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2911">“Don’t consider yourself to be on the same level as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Those were just taunting words of unimportant mobs, how could <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama be troubled by them?”</p>
<p id="line_2912">“That’s right, Onii-sama, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s heart is broader than the widest sea. To think he would hold a grudge against insignificant characters like those would be most foolish.”</p>
<p id="line_2913">Oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p id="line_2914">I suppose I could only play along now that I’d been praised like that.</p>
<p id="line_2915">“I suppose. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you are still too naive to be pissed off by things as minor as these.”</p>
<p id="line_2916">Even though I put it so nicely like that, I was still furious in heart. However, now that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had misunderstood the situation and given a better explanation instead, I could only continue to push things in that direction.</p>
<p id="line_2917">I put on a pretense and lectured everyone. And so, some time passed by.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2918">Some chairs were set up in the manner of a paper hand fan.</p>
<p id="line_2919">We were sitting on the seats meant originally for the speaker of the council. To put it simply, we were situated at the guard of the hand fan, where everyone could see us.</p>
<p id="line_2920">There was another table and an additional chair.</p>
<p id="line_2921"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others stood behind me awaiting orders.</p>
<p id="line_2922">The speaker of the council, who was hosting the event, was transferred to the safety of the second floor.</p>
<p id="line_2923">The so-called safety measure was meant to counter us. Since I was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, after all, people were still on guard against us. All the eyes of the councilors were now on us. It was rather uncomfortable sitting like this.</p>
<p id="line_2924">And so, the council conference began, but this was the start of the true hell.</p>
<p id="line_2925">Because I tried to play smart and made all the big claims, now I couldn’t get angry even if my belly were filled with rage. I had to endure the entire thing, listening to the councilors speaking.</p>
<p id="line_2926">I’d asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> beforehand about the content of the conference.</p>
<p id="line_2927">First let’s look at the flow of the conference. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wished to join the Western Council, and so the council listed a number of conditions.</p>
<p id="line_2928">We were to:</p>
<p id="line_2929">First: Abide by international law.</p>
<p id="line_2930">Second: Create an economic zone.</p>
<p id="line_2931">Third: Provide military force.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2932">These were the three main conditions.</p>
<p id="line_2933">There was nothing wrong with the first condition. Regardless of the size of the nation in the council, there was a duty to abide by international law. With that being said, the council had no authority to actually interfere with the internal affairs of its member states, which was reassuring to know.</p>
<p id="line_2934">Every merchant was to abide by the trade laws of the nations they were trading in. If there were any problems, the matter would be settled according to the laws of the aforementioned nation.</p>
<p id="line_2935">If the merchants were dissatisfied about the verdict, they could file a complaint at the embassy of their home nations. There, it would be decided whether the issue would be elevated to a national level, or the merchants would just take the losses themselves.</p>
<p id="line_2936">It seemed that we had handled the incident during the nation founding festival pretty well.</p>
<p id="line_2937">If it were to develop into a problem on a cross-national level, it would be trialed according to international law. We would need to proceed to the international court to seek a verdict, and there would have to be a third-party nation at the scene—in other words, it would be a matter to be judged by the council.</p>
<p id="line_2938">The only councilors who didn’t have a say in the issue were the ones from the nation in question. It didn’t seem all too complicated. However, to be fair, we needed to publish our national laws first. That was the main issue, but I did have the reliable <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.</p>
<p id="line_2939">We had gathered information about the laws in different nations and had a perfect, easily understood outline to act as the foundation of our nation’s law.</p>
<p id="line_2940">We presented this as well, so there shouldn’t be any problems.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2941">As for opening the economic circle, that was gonna be problematic.</p>
<p id="line_2942">The concept of a patent had yet to be introduced to this world. The current trend is that whoever could copy the design the best wins the race.</p>
<p id="line_2943">But it was too early to be worrying about something small like advancing the patent industry. If any civilization became too advanced, they would be attacked by the ‘Army of Heaven.’ As many as a million angels would attack from the sky, ransacking any towns on their way.</p>
<p id="line_2944">That’s why the Western Nations didn’t have electricity or gas. There weren’t even steam-powered machines.</p>
<p id="line_2945">But did that mean everything in this world was inconvenient? That isn’t necessarily the case as we had magic and magic items to compensate for the lack of technology. The level of fashion in this world could rival that of Japan, and even though there weren’t too many fresh food ingredients circulating on the market, the techniques of preserving the food were excellent.</p>
<p id="line_2946">On the other hand, in terms of buildings, people seemed to utilize magic for some more advanced techniques than the modern world. It might not have been possible to create the castles and other impressive buildings using just modern techniques.</p>
<p id="line_2947">And so, people lived satisfied lives with an abundance of food, clothes and residences.</p>
<p id="line_2948">Living in the city was surprisingly comfortable.</p>
<p id="line_2949">If you had to point out where a problem was—</p>
<p id="line_2950">Vesta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s research publication, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s gear display, and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that even the bearded guy representing the Kingdom of Laquia knew about, had all been somewhat leaked at this point. It wouldn’t even be a surprise if they knew about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myuran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hiring a large labor force.</p>
<p id="line_2951">The problem was not with this information being known, but rather the fact that someone was trying to steal our technologies.</p>
<p id="line_2952">Correction, it’s okay if they were just trying to steal it.</p>
<p id="line_2953">But these people were even worse, using the excuse of trading between nations to lay the tracks down in their nation first.</p>
<p id="line_2954">“You must lead the train to the duchy of Laquia first!”</p>
<p id="line_2955">“How can you make such a decision so rashly! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, we at the Republic of Zamund are worthy as allies of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_2956">“Silence! No one is asking the opinion of the nation’s representatives; can’t you see that His Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is troubled by it now?!”</p>
<p id="line_2957">Had the white-bearded councilor not come out to mitigate, the meeting probably wouldn’t have been able to continue.</p>
<p id="line_2958">It was all right for the market to expand, but I wasn’t expecting to suddenly start providing new technologies to everyone. Moreover, if all of the nations were to treat us like a lackey and ask us to do every small favor for them, I had a bad feeling that they would call us for help constantly.</p>
<p id="line_2959">It turned out that my earlier worries were not for nothing. Even though, right now I felt quite frustrated, the conference needed to carry on.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2960">About the last condition, which was to provide military force. I needed to consider that more carefully.</p>
<p id="line_2961"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had already given me the advice, which was why I had re-examined the intelligence provided by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Someone had tried to exploit our military force in the name of military assistance, which was why we wanted to take the opportunity to do the same.</p>
<p id="line_2962">Tempest would have full authority over the Great Jura Forest. They wanted us to act as a deterrent against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, which was fine. We were planning to do that anyway, which would be in our interests.</p>
<p id="line_2963">As a result of the meeting between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I, our nation would be in charge of defending the Great Jura Forest while the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would defend the deserted land.</p>
<p id="line_2964">Our nation would be handling the expenses, so surely the council would be happy to see that. In order for economic activities to proceed smoothly, the world needed to be peaceful first.</p>
<p id="line_2965">There were several nations on guard against the Eastern Empire. To them, our nation’s defense was like a lifeline to them. I must be worrying too much. If anything were to happen, our nation would be the one to take the first blow.</p>
<p id="line_2966">Based on these considerations, the third condition must be the council trying to exploit us.</p>
<p id="line_2967">We could actually use this to our advantage.</p>
<p id="line_2968">The big prerequisite was that we would handle the defense of the Great Jura Forest. Smaller nations also hoped for us to use our extra military reserve to defend their nations.</p>
<p id="line_2969">Even if the number of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> near the Great Jura Forest had decreased, there may still be unexpected <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attacks. Some dangerous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could even fly from the air. So, a nation couldn’t be picky when it came to the national defense budget.</p>
<p id="line_2970">You also needed to issue salaries for the patrolling soldiers. Clients had to pay for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> slaying to take place. If the council couldn’t respond fast enough, they needed to make up the fee with tax-payer money.</p>
<p id="line_2971">Moreover, you could only issue contracts at the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> after discovering the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. So, you could never really be fully prepared.</p>
<p id="line_2972">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> only dispatched the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to nations that recognized their religion of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as their national religion. But they had limited knights, and the amount of area to patrol was very broad. Often, there weren’t enough people when needed.</p>
<p id="line_2973">That’s where we’d come in.</p>
<p id="line_2974">Each nation will pay us for our defense fee. We would be happy to oblige any request. At the same time, our nation will play a significant role in national defense. No kingdom would be able to ignore our nation.</p>
<p id="line_2975">In other words, we would be able to demonstrate our strength and influence on the Western Nations with our strong military backing.</p>
<p id="line_2976">We can make money while also expanding our influence.</p>
<p id="line_2977">That’s a plan that can kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p id="line_2978">Moreover, if the empire really invaded—</p>
<p id="line_2979">Should I call it fortunate or unfortunate? Tempest sat in the middle of the Empire’s invasion route. We’d have to fight them regardless, so we might as well unite with the people standing behind us. It is exactly what we wanted—for them to be not afraid of us and willingly accept our defense force.</p>
<p id="line_2980">It would require an absolute difference in terms of strength to make this a reality. We would need to show them they have no chance of winning. Or else, it would be extremely foolish to hand their entire national defense to another nation.</p>
<p id="line_2981"><em>If we can’t win by resisting, then we might as well use it</em>—if we can have everyone think that way, this tactic may actually work.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2982">The councilors were either making demands or interrupting people now. It was then that the speaker announced that his explanation concluded.</p>
<p id="line_2983">“—These are the conditions for the inclusion of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the council. Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, do you disagree with any of the items?”</p>
<p id="line_2984">Here, if you didn’t state any objection, you were considered to have agreed.</p>
<p id="line_2985">I may ignore the views of every councilor here, but I wouldn’t miss a single item on the list of conditions.</p>
<p id="line_2986">We wanted to exploit the council as well, so it’d be for nothing if we were to be bound by the treaty.</p>
<p id="line_2987"><em>Don’t you normally draft these things in paper for us to ponder upon?</em></p>
<p id="line_2988">—I was quite displeased by this.</p>
<p id="line_2989">What should we do if we couldn’t give a response right after they demanded an answer?</p>
<p id="line_2990">I guess that this was their way of provoking us as well.</p>
<p id="line_2991">With that being said, I did have <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san on hand. It would examine everything that was said in detail and use my hands to take notes. How omnipotent.</p>
<p id="line_2992">That’s why I got to ponder upon all of the items and raise objections.</p>
<p id="line_2993">“I have reviewed every item in detail and have drafted doubts as well as alternative plans. If you are willing to accept, we won’t have any problem either.”</p>
<p id="line_2994">I handed over the written document to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, to which he stood up and passed it to the speaker.</p>
<p id="line_2995">The speaker was forced to accept it.</p>
<p id="line_2996">“—What?”</p>
<p id="line_2997">I mostly agreed to their conditions. However, in order to benefit from their attempts at exploiting me, I changed some of the content.</p>
<p id="line_2998"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san very kindly took a record of the revised draft.</p>
<p id="line_2999">Unlike just a mere verbal delivery, you could understand everything even after the whole ordeal. The speaker seemed to have looked down upon us because we were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. When he saw that his speech just now had been copied down in ink exactly as he had delivered, his face went pale instantly. Moreover, his expression practically said, ‘Guess we can’t get away with this one.’ There were even revisions using red ink. No wonder why the speaker was so shocked.</p>
<p id="line_3000">But it’s all thanks to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, not me. Although I did need to act all smug for the occasion.</p>
<p id="line_3001">“Feel free to speak up if there’s any problem.”</p>
<p id="line_3002">If they don’t accept the proposal we raised, we don’t have to join the council. I would choose to give up deliberately. After all, there hadn’t been enough time, and if the public wouldn’t accept us, all we needed to do was to change our policies and only have in depth interactions with the nations that recognize us.</p>
<p id="line_3003">“No, there is no problem… But I hope you may give us some time to discuss Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s proposal.”</p>
<p id="line_3004">Looks like the speaker is no fool. He realized we were not easy to deal with.</p>
<p id="line_3005">But he raised no objections against our proposal, instead he decided to examine the document in detail.</p>
<p id="line_3006">Didn’t you just deny us any time to ponder—even if I thought so, there was no benefit in us objecting now. So, I decided to accept his demand.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3007">How did things turn out this way?</p>
<p id="line_3008">The table that was kicked into the air landed slowly.

<p id="line_3009"><em>So you’ve finally done it</em>—even if she didn’t spell it out for me, that line pinched my heart like a needle.</p>
<p id="line_3010">With a massive crack, the table hit the ground hard. I slammed the table with my heel, and it shattered into pieces.</p>
<p id="line_3011">No use crying over spilled milk.</p>
<p id="line_3012">I crossed my legs on the chair casually, acting as if everything was going according to my plan. I glared around at the councilors, whose faces had all turned pale, and sighed internally.</p>
<p id="line_3013">To be honest, I managed to hold it back at first.</p>
<p id="line_3014">People called me a mature adult and a role model for Tempest. I was proud of my open heart. You can tell from my behavior lately alone.</p>
<p id="line_3015">People said that I was the embodiment of patience and was even good at handling Milim. It’s because of my open heart that I was able to endure Milim’s stubbornness with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_3016">However…</p>
<p id="line_3017">What happens when a kindhearted slime gets crossed by a bunch of disgusting and horrible middle-aged men whose eyes glimmer with greed?</p>
<p id="line_3018">They get what they deserve, AKA a large table smashed in front of them.</p>
<p id="line_3019">There had been a three-hour intermission before the meeting resumed once more. It was then that problems emerged.</p>
<p id="line_3020">Regarding the files I mentioned, some councilors handed a bizarre document titled ‘Petition’ to me. Seeing how tired the speaker looked, this was not his idea. But I had no time to feel sorry for him.</p>
<p id="line_3021">As I skimmed the proposal, I realized most of the content in it was baffling.</p>
<p id="line_3022">The items were as follows:</p>
<p id="line_3023">One, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was to lead to the kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, while the construction fees needed to be paid by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> itself.</p>
<p id="line_3024">Two, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was required to supply high-grade equipment that would be used to strengthen the military reserves of the Western Nations, as a show of support.</p>
<p id="line_3025">Three, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s labyrinth was a treasure for all humankind, and thus, it was necessary for the council to oversee its execution and running.</p>
<p id="line_3026">Four, as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> joined the council, it needed to pay a set amount of taxes each year. Moreover, when it came to choosing a representative for Tempest, due to safety measures, only human candidates would be accepted.</p>
<p id="line_3027">And etc., etc.</p>
<p id="line_3028">They really went wild with their demands.</p>
<p id="line_3029">The rational side of me shattered within three seconds. These guys were truly impressive to have pissed me off in a mere three seconds.</p>
<p id="line_3030">Demands like these weren’t worth more inspection. This was beyond an unfair treaty. If I were to sign such a treaty, I might as well give up on coexistence with humans.</p>
<p id="line_3031">“Ehh, fellows, are you looking down on me? I’ll allow you to say whatever you want, but where did you get the impression that you can make demands of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_3032">After kicking the table, I calmed down a bit.</p>
<p id="line_3033">I suppressed my anger and questioned the councilors with their heads low.</p>
<p id="line_3034">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is asking a question. Don’t be so quiet now, please answer quickly,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> added on the assault with a smile, her words were even more effective than mine. All the councilors felt the immense pressure eating them alive and began to sweat.</p>
<p id="line_3035">“You all seem to have been mistaken. My nation is preparing to build a huge economic zone. But even so, I intend to join the Western Council. But this is for one reason—that is, we do not intend to antagonize humanity. But since you are clearly unwilling to cooperate, I don’t suppose we should either—”</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/illustrations/image8.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_3036"></p>
<p id="line_3037">The meeting hall fell silent with my words echoing.</p>
<p id="line_3038">Even though my voice wasn’t that loud, it went straight into every councilor’s heart and inspired fear.</p>
<p id="line_3039">I did not use my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord Haki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ since if I used it on humans, the luckier ones would only fall in a state of fear, but for the unlucky, they would probably go mad, or even die in pain like a maniac. That’s why I won’t use it in a place like this.</p>
<p id="line_3040">And of course, I won’t brainwash them either.</p>
<p id="line_3041">It will ruin any prospect of us befriending humans. I don’t want to deal with boring puppet-like companions who would only say YES.</p>
<p id="line_3042">Anyhow, at least I only destroyed the table in anger this time before expressing my opinion.</p>
<p id="line_3043">Yet this alone was tremendously effective.</p>
<p id="line_3044">“N-no, that wasn’t our intent when raising those terms, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono…”</p>
<p id="line_3045">“I-indeed! We were only trying to build a bridge of friendship with your nation, it was just a careless mistake that we got a bit too presumptuous.”</p>
<p id="line_3046">The councilors started to panic and tried to find excuses.</p>
<p id="line_3047">But I only got angrier as I listened.</p>
<p id="line_3048">By the way—</p>
<p id="line_3049">You are still calling me ‘dono’ even though I’m the ruler of a nation.</p>
<p id="line_3050">If you were the king or chancellor of a nation, then I suppose I could give it a pass. But if you were to call me that without actually leading a nation, it is the equivalent of looking down on our kingdom. It’s almost as if they were talking to the king of their vassal states, there wasn’t a shred of respect in their tone. These people were clearly looking down on us, thinking that we were just some <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3051">I can tolerate it if I get looked down on, but I cannot tolerate my nation being looked down upon. I’m a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> after all.</p>
<p id="line_3052">I was hoping that they would at least treat us in a manner worthy of such a title. But things were much more severe than I expected.</p>
<p id="line_3053">We stayed in the most luxurious hotel, and many councilors were polite to us, but that’s what made me careless.</p>
<p id="line_3054">Even with all this playing a part, their attitudes overall were still horrible.</p>
<p id="line_3055">“Huh? Then what exactly was your motive? It sounds to me that you want to make the people of my nation your slaves and work them into the ground for your sake?”</p>
<p id="line_3056">“N-no! That’s not the case at all!”</p>
<p id="line_3057">“We have no such intention! That’s not our motive at all—”</p>
<p id="line_3058">The councilors tried their hardest to explain.</p>
<p id="line_3059">So, these were the kinds of nobles representing their nations. What a pain to deal with. Even someone with an open heart like me was approaching the limit of my patience dealing with them.</p>
<p id="line_3060">I imagine <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must be one sly fox to have been able to play these stinky ocelots in his palm.<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="What a confusing line for the English readers, apparently Fuse liked it so much he lifted it straight from the web novel. “こういう狸どもを手玉に取っていたのなら,ユウキはなかなかの狐だと言う事”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span></p>
<p id="line_3061">I really want to learn from him, but I don’t think I’d be able to manage.</p>
<p id="line_3062">«Proposal. Allow me to handle the situation and engage automatic response? YES/NO.»</p>
<p id="line_3063"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san seemed to have said something, or was I hearing things?</p>
<p id="line_3064">It is very outstanding, but a Skill is just a Skill, there’s no way that it could have interjected freely like that. Maybe I’d relied on it too much every day, to be hallucinating its voice due to my wishes. If it were possible, it could even handle speech, then what the hell was all that I just suffered through?</p>
<p id="line_3065">I shook my head at such a ridiculous notion. And continued to glare at the councilors in front of me impatiently.</p>
<p id="line_3066">This was bad.</p>
<p id="line_3067">Now that I had regained my cool, I was troubled about how to salvage the situation. People always say that ‘A hasty man is seldom out of trouble,’ if anything were to go wrong here, it would be difficult to mend things.</p>
<p id="line_3068">The councilors were trying really hard, as was I.</p>
<p id="line_3069">«Report. There is no problem. Just as master has thought, it has been confirmed that the whole venue was under the influence of mental interference.»</p>
<p id="line_3070"><em>Huh? What did you just say?!</em></p>
<p id="line_3071">I honestly wasn’t thinking anything, not a single thought. I only acted because of my anger.</p>
<p id="line_3072">But—</p>
<p id="line_3073">«Report. Mental manipulation has been discovered after collecting several samples. Similar to the individual ‘Gai,’ it appears that the majority of the councilors here have been psychologically influenced by someone. Interrupt interference? YES/NO.»</p>
<p id="line_3074"><em>Ehh, do I really have to spell it out…</em></p>
<p id="line_3075">I chose YES without hesitation. With that, the few councilors who had remained silent until now began to speak.</p>
<p id="line_3076">“Of course His Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be angered by this! This is an absolute disgrace on our side, how can we make it up to you—”</p>
<p id="line_3077">“Hold on, all of these terms were never mentioned prior to the meeting!”</p>
<p id="line_3078">“Who is it, who drafted this on their own?”</p>
<p id="line_3079">The situation suddenly changed.</p>
<p id="line_3080"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san sure was impressive, always so reliable.</p>
<p id="line_3081">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="fufu" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, looks like all the councilors have regained their reasoning.”</p>
<p id="line_3082">I pretended as if I’ve seen through everything and mumbled rather pompously. I was just trying to play cool for a second, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> reacted to it.</p>
<p id="line_3083">“I see how it is now! I was wondering why they were acting strange, could it have been some sort of mental interference?”</p>
<p id="line_3084">So, what happened exactly, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san?</p>
<p id="line_3085">«Answer. It was a form of mental interference. The source of interference was not from magicules, so it took some time to decrypt it, but there aren’t that many people with the same wavelength at the same time. This one thought it would take more time to deactivate it, but the wavelength of master’s anger caused a ‘tear’ in it.»</p>
<p id="line_3086">I see, so everything was within my expectation—I’ll pretend that to be the case.</p>
<p id="line_3087">“Looks like the effect wasn’t that strong. The mental interference was only strong enough to make some councilors short-sighted.” I commented casually.</p>
<p id="line_3088">Fooled by my words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the other two looked at me with newfound respect.</p>
<p id="line_3089">“I see, so is that why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama just pressured the councilors to plunge them into chaos?”</p>
<p id="line_3090">“That was indeed the case, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. All done with deep considerations.”</p>
<p id="line_3091">Since I was afraid he would inherit the irritation of mine, I had to clarify first. It’d be great if I could explain this with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well.</p>
<p id="line_3092">I had enough time to take a breath at this point, but still I was confused, nonetheless.</p>
<p id="line_3093">Who was conducting the mental interference?</p>
<p id="line_3094">It was definitely not <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3095">Since it could have left evidence, I don’t think he would have done it. If he were to risk leaving any possible trace, he would need a strong enough motive—to which I can’t come up with one no matter how I think about it.</p>
<p id="line_3096">So, who was the one that orchestrated this incident?</p>
<p id="line_3097">This is no time to get to the bottom of that.</p>
<p id="line_3098">Right now, I had to resolve the problem at hand. Some of the councilors began to pressure those who regained their reasoning. It must have been these people who drafted the petition. The number was greater than I expected. Moreover, some of them still seemed very smug.</p>
<p id="line_3099">They have other tricks up their sleeves—that’s the only explanation.</p>
<p id="line_3100">It was then that I felt something was wrong. Some of the councilors began to look towards the back door of the meeting hall.</p>
<p id="line_3101">I listened carefully and heard sounds of footsteps.</p>
<p id="line_3102"><em>Have they called for the guards?</em></p>
<p id="line_3103">«Report. There was no such activity detected. It has likely been a pre-planned event.»</p>
<p id="line_3104"><em>Hmm. Looks like they planned to provoke me on purpose and then send in people to suppress me?</em></p>
<p id="line_3105">They sure were confident—they were still fighting a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you know?</p>
<p id="line_3106">It was unbelievable how they decided to utilize such a flawed plan, but the residents that lived around <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to have enough sense of crisis. Perhaps it was because they lived too far away from the threat of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that these people had become too complacent.</p>
<p id="line_3107">The same went for these councilors, they were too happy-go-lucky.</p>
<p id="line_3108">Perhaps they were the “Idiots with ill intent” mentioned by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…</p>
<p id="line_3109">When I realized this, the door happened to be open as a dozen soldiers and a large man walked inside.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3110">“Oh oh, how very pretentious.

Are you really so arrogant as to only bring three servants?” The man yelled the moment he laid eyes on me. How unintelligent.</p>
<p id="line_3111">His laugh was pretty maniacal, completely looking down on me.</p>
<p id="line_3112">This was not something that could simply be described as just being rude. He was clearly here to cause trouble, there was no room for excuses. Even we were astonished to the point that we couldn’t help but look at each other.</p>
<p id="line_3113"><em>No, hold up a minute. This must be the enemy’s strategy.</em></p>
<p id="line_3114"><em>How very cunning—</em></p>
<p id="line_3115">«Answer. This man likely does not have such capabilities.»</p>

<p id="line_3119"><em>Just in case, yeah, just in case, I’ll confirm with him.</em></p>

<p id="line_3122">While I was angry as well, I could still make a joke out of the situation.</p>
<p id="line_3123">I managed to stay calm and began to talk to him, in an attempt to work things out.</p>
<p id="line_3124">In the end, it was a wasted effort.</p>
<p id="line_3125">“Yeah, it’s you all right. I remember that the idiot’s name was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_3126">So, he wasn’t mistaken. That meant it was okay to kill him then…</p>
<p id="line_3127">“—Oi, you there, don’t get ahead of yourself now! I don’t know why you are doing this, but this is a public area with a bunch of eye-witnesses. You think you can break the laws here and get away with it scot-free?”</p>
<p id="line_3128">I decided to use the law as my shield and force this idiot away.</p>
<p id="line_3129">Then again, I wasn’t exactly qualified to say something after destroying the table, but that was different.</p>
<p id="line_3130">Otherwise, I would’ve really killed him.

<p id="line_3136"><em>I know that already! You don’t have to explain things seriously so often like I’m actually an idiot.</em></p>
<p id="line_3137">By the way, the item the large man was holding, I’d seen that magic artifact before when Milim was pretending to be manipulated—the Domination Orb. It seemed to be the real deal, but the question was if it would actually work on me.</p>
<p id="line_3138">«Answer. Domination Orb is ineffective in controlling master.»</p>
<p id="line_3139">Glad to hear.</p>
<p id="line_3140">I wasn’t sure where he got an item like that, but it was best to completely destroy something so dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_3141">With that thought, I stood up from my chair.</p>
<p id="line_3142">Confused at the sudden turn of events, the speaker seemed to regain his senses and began to shout in panic.</p>

<p id="line_3151">The councilors fell in disarray at these comments.</p>
<p id="line_3152">Seeing this reaction, they obviously had nothing to do with the large man.</p>

<p id="line_3296">The result was obvious.</p>

<p id="line_3298">The number of pages in the ledger was greater than the number of councilors who have stood up for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elric" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3299">«Answer. It seems that with the deactivation of mental interference, they have recovered their conscience.»</p>
<p id="line_3300">I see.</p>
<p id="line_3301">So, they realized how stupid they were after regaining reason.</p>
<p id="line_3302">That was certainly good to know.</p>
<p id="line_3303">So, all the fellow councilors had decided to join forces with me based on the rules of justice and fairness.</p>

<p id="line_3309"><em>Anyway, surely those councilors who have regained their reason were able to tell what’s right and wrong. Then I would treat them with the same courtesy and keep their embezzlement a secret.</em></p>
<p id="line_3310">But if one councilor’s judgement could determine the fate of a nation, then there was something wrong with the system.

<p id="line_3388">“Silence.

<p id="line_3389">“Hmph, don’t you regret saying something like that now! I won’t show mercy even to women and children.”</p>
<p id="line_3390">Gai unsheathed his sword as he finished. As expected from a holy sword, it looked awesome.</p>
<p id="line_3391">Seeing that weapon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s smile intensified.

<p id="line_3395">And so, under the eyes of the many authority figures within the council, the two groups confronted each other.</p>

<p id="line_3402">That was kind of expected to be honest.

<p id="line_3405">That slash alone shattered Gai’s sword.</p>
<p id="line_3406">“—What the fuck?”</p>
<p id="line_3407">As he made this almost comical response, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the chance to follow up.</p>

<p id="line_3410">The difference in strength was obvious. But for him to think he still had a chance to win, I couldn’t help but wonder just how delusional he could be.</p>

<p id="line_3413">“Yeah, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> taught her Jujitsu.”</p>
<p id="line_3414">The miko princess sure was talented.</p>
<p id="line_3415">Speaking of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s jujitsu, it was like the ancient martial arts used for combat. It was a dangerous style that contained many lethal techniques. It was definitely beyond ordinary arts of self-defense.</p>
<p id="line_3416">To have taught the princess such a dangerous martial art—I finally got more insight to the aggressive nature of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="ogre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> clan.</p>

<p id="line_3418">Gai pulled out his backup sword, yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, teasing her opponent, tripped Gai over his feet.</p>
<p id="line_3419">The weight of his armor completely obliterated Gai’s attack. He desperately tried to get to his feet with no success.</p>
<p id="line_3420"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> glared coldly at Gai on the ground.</p>
<p id="line_3421">Her petite mouth began to chant spells.</p>
<p id="line_3422">“I pray to thy god, grant me thy holy power, lend me thy ears to hear my wishes—”</p>
<p id="line_3423">Her words, in the form of prayer, went beyond time and space to be channeled to me.</p>
<p id="line_3424">Although I was standing next to her, it didn’t matter at this point.</p>
<p id="line_3425">“Huh? What the hell is going on?”</p>
<p id="line_3426">Gai was shocked as layers of magic circles began to close around him.</p>
<p id="line_3427">“Wait! T-this magic is—!”</p>
<p id="line_3428">Ah hah, so Gai knew.</p>
<p id="line_3429">I guess he really was above rank A. But even if you knew, there was no way he could deal with this. At this point of the casting, he couldn’t possibly escape. He had no choice but to tough it out or try to defend himself.</p>
<p id="line_3430">Although, I doubted he would be able to do either. After all, this spell—</p>
<p id="line_3431">“EWWEEEEEEE—! P-please stop—!”</p>
<p id="line_3432">“—All things in life shall come to an end! ‘Disintegration’!”</p>
<p id="line_3433">—Was the strongest spell in all holy magic.</p>
<p id="line_3434">A stream of light devoured Gai, and there was nothing left—or so it seemed.</p>
<p id="line_3435">Woah, it looked like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had killed the guy—or so I thought. She didn’t, however.</p>
<p id="line_3436">“Guu…guu…guuu…”</p>
<p id="line_3437">The light faded, leaving behind a half-naked Gai. He probably lost all the strength in his legs and couldn’t stand up as he collapsed on the ground, exhausted. His intelligence seemed to have devolved to that of an infant as he started bawling with tears and snot all over his face.</p>
<p id="line_3438">But he lived. Congrats, congrats.</p>
<p id="line_3439">“Ara, looks like my technique <em>was not masterful enough</em>. The spell didn’t seem to work. I see that spells that I’m still practicing really are quite useless.”</p>

I almost couldn’t hold back my tease of ‘Seriously?’ After all, to use ‘Disintegration’ so precisely as to only destroy the armor, it only could have only been done with absolutely perfect execution.</p>

Yet somehow, she had already mastered the most difficult spell. It seemed like she really was talented in magic. Her Unique Skill ‘Analyzer’ must have played a vital role in assisting her study.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_3461">After the victor had been decided, I stood up from my seat on the first floor and glanced around at the councilors.</p>

<p id="line_3472">And so, I was sure that I had got the upper hand.</p>

Somewhere two kilometers away from here, someone was directing killing intent towards the conference.</p>
<p id="line_3486">It was so far away, what could they be planning—?</p>
<p id="line_3487">I immediately executed ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Thought Acceleration" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and confirmed the situation. ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ showed a wild-looking red-haired woman. She was holding a small black iron block—a pistol.</p>
<p id="line_3488">Huh? Why was she using a pistol when she was so far away?</p>
<p id="line_3489">What was the effective range of that gun—?</p>
<p id="line_3490">«Answer. Official name for the weapon is Walther P99—small in size but extremely competent. Light in weight, high in proficiency. Its effective range is sixty meters.»</p>
<p id="line_3491">—Right, knowing this information wouldn’t help much either.</p>
<p id="line_3492">Even if it were extremely proficient, when its effective range was sixty meters, it wouldn’t matter.</p>
<p id="line_3493">Right now, the building we were in was located in the central area of the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and it was a special-alert zone. The walls of the surrounding area had been processed with magic-resisting enchantments. It was extremely firm and couldn’t be pierced by any weaker attacks.</p>
<p id="line_3494">Moreover, the bullet that would be shot would still obey the laws of physics, being affected by gravity and air resistance. You could strengthen it with magic or Skills, but you might as well have just prepared a sniper rifle.</p>
<p id="line_3495">On top of that, even if you were using a sniper rifle, there was no use if you couldn’t see the target.</p>
<p id="line_3496">The woman could not see <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elric" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> directly from that position. Even if she had my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and locked onto a target, sniping wasn’t possible as there were many walls in its direct path.</p>
<p id="line_3497">That wasn’t even adding on the fact that with the recent assassination of Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the conference building was well guarded. I was also cautious and had made preparations beforehand. I’d confirmed that it would be difficult to snipe from an area that far away from the conference. That was why her action would be meaningless…logically speaking.</p>
<p id="line_3498">Could it be that she could deflect bullets and change their path—?</p>
<p id="line_3499">Just as that thought crossed my mind, the red-haired woman pulled the trigger.</p>
<p id="line_3500">In a moment’s delay, as if in a frame-by-frame animation, I watched the bullet leaving the chamber at an incredible speed before suddenly being sucked into a black hole that appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p id="line_3501">—Eh!</p>
<p id="line_3502">To my shock, the bullet disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p id="line_3504">‘Spatial Connection’ apparently was a Skill that could connect two recognized points. The distance between the two points couldn’t be too far away, and the area of effect was very narrow, so it didn’t need much effort to perform.</p>
<p id="line_3505">But right now, I had no time to listen to explanations like that.</p>
<p id="line_3506">The red-haired woman was comprehending the space through ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’ The next second, the bullet reemerged next to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elric" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She launched the Skill at the location with precision.</p>
<p id="line_3507">As a result—she completely ignored the two kilometers in between us as well as the outer walls. The assassination plan was about to succeed.</p>
<p id="line_3508">A small black hole appeared around fifty centimeters away from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elric" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s head. And from it flew the lethal bullet travelling at over four hundred meters per second.</p>
<p id="line_3509">It was just as powerful as if it were shot nearby. There was no obstacle in its path, and the bullet was closing in on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elric" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3510">Slowly, but surely. I could see it travelling.</p>
<p id="line_3511">Yet in this situation, there was nothing I could do. I didn’t have time to warn him, and even if I were to take action, I wouldn’t be fast enough to stop the bullet.</p>

<p id="line_3571">He was too cunning for the circumstances, surely, he was confident enough that he wouldn’t leave any clues. If that were the case, would that mean it’d be difficult to incriminate him as well?

<p id="line_3572">This was why noblemen were so annoying.</p>

<p id="line_3581">This middle-aged man had a beautiful face. The thick blonde hair and the tilting moustache suited him very well.</p>

<p id="line_3583">“I suppose so. But the misunderstanding has been resolved.”</p>
<p id="line_3584">I didn’t want the matter to get any more severe. If the human society were willing to accept us, I suppose I could turn a blind eye to some rudeness.</p>
<p id="line_3585">“—Is that so? I have not come as king, but as a father to apologize to you, as well as to thank you.” As he finished, King Aegil nodded to me lightly.</p>
<p id="line_3586">If even the king was willing to lower his head in apology, this whole ordeal was likely resolved.</p>
<p id="line_3587">“I accept your apologies, but hopefully this won’t happen again.”</p>
<p id="line_3588">“Yes, I understand. I wish to build a healthy relationship with you, too.”</p>
<p id="line_3589">King Aegil’s eyes were sharp and straight when he said this. I could tell he was genuine.</p>
<p id="line_3590">It was best to not ponder too much this time and just believe him. If he were to betray us, we’d worry about that in time.</p>

<p id="line_3618">These people were probably the so-called magical inquisitors.</p>
<p id="line_3619">Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Reiner" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Gai tried to resist, the newcomers effortlessly took care of them.

<p id="line_3620">As expected from the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they were, indeed, a powerful nation. They had kept leashes on some very impressive fellows.</p>
<p id="line_3621">«Report. It has been deduced that this is likely a demonstration of force. In order to inform master that this kingdom possesses strong individuals as well.»</p>
<p id="line_3622">In other words, he was probably saying “don’t look down on us.” It was a public announcement to remind us that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Reiner" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not the strongest that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could offer so as to save the face for their nation.</p>
<p id="line_3623">Being a king sure looked hard. He had to plan something like this just so that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wouldn’t get the better of them.</p>
<p id="line_3624">If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elric" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s plan actually worked, the king would probably have wanted to use me to fortify the authority of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But to be honest, if they didn’t have even the slightest evil intentions, there was no way they could pitch a fight against any other cunning noblemen.</p>
<p id="line_3625">“Sorry for the interruption. Our nation shall take care of the remaining matters.”</p>
<p id="line_3626">Leaving this line, the king and his men left.</p>
<p id="line_3627">They were smart and even took the Domination Orb. But that wasn’t a problem. It’d be problematic if they used it for evil causes, so I secretly broke a core functioning part.</p>
<p id="line_3628">I didn’t want to get more involved in the matter, so I saw them off quietly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3629">We rested a bit in the afternoon and reconvened the conference thereafter.</p>
<p id="line_3630">Unlike the morning conference, the councilors all seemed highly unmotivated. There was no need to threaten these exhausted noblemen. They needed to examine and pass important motions.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3631">First, acknowledge <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as a nation.</p>
<p id="line_3632">Second, allowing the inclusion of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> into the council.</p>
<p id="line_3633">Thirdly, sharing the military authority of the council with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3634">Those were the three main items that passed.</p>
<p id="line_3635">The document I forced them to examine was passed as well. There was a unanimous agreement. Although it was a lengthy process with various complications, my document was still passed. And the matter was set in stone.</p>
<p id="line_3636">I wasn’t good at dealing with the cunning councilors. It was very tiring scheming and detecting words in words.</p>
<p id="line_3637">I handed all that to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.</p>
<p id="line_3638">«…Understood.»</p>
<p id="line_3639">In terms of results, we kind of used brute force to resolve the issues.</p>
<p id="line_3640">But I didn’t really participate. It was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and our precious little <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-chan. I, on the other hand, would be considered the benefactor who rescued <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elric" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That was enough to prove my generous heart. I was personally very satisfied.</p>
<p id="line_3641">Apart from that—</p>
<p id="line_3642">It was a fool’s errand to use force against the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—they all knew this, so I suppose it was very meaningful.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3643">The conference ended smoothly, and we all left.</p>
<p id="line_3644">And so, the conference, filled with twists and turns, had finally concluded.</p>

<h1 class="ch-number">Chapter 4</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">The True Identity of the Mastermind</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_3646">The beautiful ex-mercenary—Glenda Attley. Every time she pulled her trigger, a life was taken.</p>
<p id="line_3647">Ever since she was summoned to this world, she held onto her beloved firearm. It had never betrayed Glenda’s expectations. It became a part of her, so much so that shooting became second nature. With the addition of the Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sniper" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ Glenda was invincible.</p>
<p id="line_3648">Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sniper" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’—this Skill has three main functions: ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ for the amazing ability to identify any target, ‘Outcome Calculation’ to analyze actions, and ‘Space Manipulation.’</p>
<p id="line_3649">The last function in particular, ‘Space Manipulation,’ made Glenda almost invincible. Within her field of vision, Glenda could connect the space between any two points. In other words, her effective range of fire was anywhere within her eyesight. She could fire a bullet right next to the enemy’s head, making bullets pass through any obstacles at will to hit the intended target. Factors such as gravity and air resistance could be neglected by her, allowing her to perform long-distance sniping even without a sniper rifle.</p>
<p id="line_3650">These conditions made her emerge victorious in every fight.</p>
<p id="line_3651">However, the misstep she made last time made her realize that there were stronger individuals out there.</p>
<p id="line_3652"><em>It wouldn’t work. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like that are too strong for me.</em></p>
<p id="line_3653">With a single glance, Glenda had immediately recognized how dangerous her enemy was. That opponent—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—was someone Glenda couldn’t hurt with her pistol. This wasn’t simply about physical attacks being ineffective against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, however.</p>
<p id="line_3654">There were two different types of bullets in her arsenal that Glenda could fire: normal bullets and magic bullets. If she didn’t want to leave any magical trace, she would use the normal bullets. Faced by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that were resistant to physical attacks, she would concentrate her own mana into bullets and fire them as a magical attack. It was a universal mechanism that was designed to be effective against all manner of opponents. Therefore, one would assume that Glenda had no blind spots in that regard.</p>
<p id="line_3655">However, her fight against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was different.</p>
<p id="line_3656">Glenda’s instincts were screaming at her to run away. Her ‘Outcome Calculation’ she had relied on predicted no other outcome but her demise.</p>
<p id="line_3657">Even with her overpowered abilities, there were still opponents in this world that she couldn’t defeat. On that day, this fact was laid bare in front of her eyes. It was hard for her to swallow.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3658">And today—</p>
<p id="line_3659">Glenda started to work on the assassination as her target came within range of her ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’</p>
<p id="line_3660">The bullet she shot would appear around fifty centimeters away from the target. In a blink of an eye, her target would receive a headshot—that was common sense.</p>
<p id="line_3661">Fifty centimeters was a wonderful distance. When connecting dimensions, there could only be a certain amount of mass overlapping with the wormhole, anything exceeding a certain threshold would cause the connection to fail. In other words, if her target moved around, the space that Glenda connected between them could be disrupted.</p>
<p id="line_3662">That’s why she chose fifty centimeters.</p>
<p id="line_3663">No matter how strong her opponent was, no one could deal with such a small object suddenly appearing at such a short distance. The bullet would tear through the air at supersonic speed; her target probably wouldn’t even catch a glimpse of it.</p>
<p id="line_3664"><em>It may be a different case for a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but some prince of a large state is much easier to deal with. Never mind, there’s no use for me to sigh at this point. Let’s just prepare for the next encounter.</em></p>
<p id="line_3665">At that moment, Glenda was calm and composed, but in the next second, something shocking occurred. The bullet that was meant to pierce through the prince’s skull disappeared.</p>
<p id="line_3666">“How can this be! What happened?!”</p>
<p id="line_3667">The unexpected situation of paranormal activity became her reality.

<p id="line_3669">Glenda’s instincts told her so. She fired once more.</p>
<p id="line_3670">If the perfect ambush didn’t work, taking more shots would be in vain. Even though she knew this in her heart, the mission would fail if she did not do so.

<p id="line_3675">Glenda was shocked, but she realized something. He didn’t ask for her name. Glenda judged that it was not because he wasn’t interested, but that he had planned to capture her before interrogating her.</p>

<p id="line_3677">The assassination had failed.</p>
<p id="line_3678">And now, the worst outcome would be her capture. If she were to continue making mistakes, she would be executed for incompetence. There had been several colleagues of hers who suffered that fate. She had to prioritize running away.</p>
<p id="line_3679">After making up her mind, she engaged a stand-off against her enemy.</p>
<p id="line_3680">“…He knew about my planned attack?”</p>
<p id="line_3681">“I spoke too much, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has already seen through everything. You can resist all you want; I don’t plan to kill you anyway. But the more you resist, the more you will suffer.”</p>
<p id="line_3682">“Hmph! How generous of you. Then I shall not hold back.”</p>
<p id="line_3683">Without hesitation, Glenda pulled her trigger as she finished her sentence.</p>
<p id="line_3684">She only shot one normal bullet. There were sixteen more rounds left. However, she figured that it wouldn’t work on this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3685"><em>Magic bullets might work…</em> As she thought so, Glenda pulled out her army knife. It was clean and swift. There was elegance in her ferocious strike as Glenda slashed at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. He dodged the attack with minimal movement, Glenda grinned as she saw that.</p>
<p id="line_3686">The knife was enchanted with her mana. Not only did her weapon deal physical damage, she also gave the knife a magic effect. This was specifically used to deal with opponents who were resistant to physical attacks. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> surely wouldn’t have thought that the knife was of any threat.</p>
<p id="line_3687">Moreover, Glenda had seen through <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s preference in combat.</p>
<p id="line_3688"><em>This guy doesn’t like dragging on with combat. If that’s the case, he probably would get tricked by a simple attack like this. I’ll break your calm demeanor.</em></p>
<p id="line_3689">As she thought, Glenda continued her attack. Her right hand had her knife while her left hand held her gun. She didn’t hesitate to continue shooting as she observed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reaction. As she predicted, he didn’t react much, since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought that even if the attack were to connect, it wouldn’t deal much damage.</p>
<p id="line_3690">But he wasn’t getting careless, he was still very cautious of Glenda’s right hand.</p>
<p id="line_3691"><em>I’ve still got one more card up my sleeve. But among the people I’ve battled, he’s probably the strongest.</em></p>
<p id="line_3692">As far as she was concerned, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t count. Her logic was that opponents she couldn’t fight at all should not be included.</p>
<p id="line_3693">It was then that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s left index finger twitched. Glenda didn’t miss it, she immediately backflipped away upon sensing the danger. She quickly distanced herself from her opponent.</p>
<p id="line_3694">It was the right call. In the next second, extremely thin strings closed in on where Glenda was just a moment ago.</p>
<p id="line_3695">“Ho, you are quite sharp.”</p>
<p id="line_3696">“Thanks for the compliment, you ain’t half bad.”</p>
<p id="line_3697">While exchanging praise, Glenda didn’t forget to shoot in return of the favor.</p>
<p id="line_3698">It was not too big of a threat to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. As opposed to dodging, he was more focused on approaching her head on.</p>
<p id="line_3699"><em>As expected, he’s pretty naive. That’s great, this type of enemy is easy to take care of.</em></p>
<p id="line_3700">Magic bullets didn’t require gunpowder. They could be shot while suppressed, and you could mix them in while shooting normal bullets.</p>
<p id="line_3701">Her opponent, who had gotten used to her tactic, would be too careless to defend himself. She would be able to defeat him when he least expected it. That was Glenda’s strategy.</p>
<p id="line_3702">The attack that he thought was incapable of harming him would become the fatal blow. Even if her opponent were on guard, such a sudden strike would still be difficult to react to.</p>
<p id="line_3703">Glenda had defeated some strong people before, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reaction was just like theirs. As his right shoulder was hit by the magic bullet, he was sent flying spectacularly.</p>
<p id="line_3704">“Ahahahaha, how embarrassing for a handsome man like you. Lamar fell for the same trick. The more confident you are, the easier it is to be played by a simple trick such as this.”</p>
<p id="line_3705">Glenda laughed out loud. But her eyes weren’t slacking. She was inspecting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s wound.</p>
<p id="line_3706">You shouldn’t be careless when hunting your prey. That was the ironclad rule of warfare. Until she made sure that her opponent was dead, Glenda would not let her guard down.</p>
<p id="line_3707">After all, she didn’t think that one bullet would be able to kill <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3708">“…I see you are more difficult to handle than I expected.”</p>
<p id="line_3709">“You a sore loser or something? Sorry, but since you’ve seen my face, I’ll have to eliminate you.”</p>
<p id="line_3710"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stood up, his right arm missing. Glenda could see her victory before her. Still, she was even more cautious as she pointed the gun in front of her.</p>
<p id="line_3711"><em>Magic bullet worked. And now for my trump card, I’m gonna make sure to blow his head off.</em></p>
<p id="line_3712">Glenda activated her Unique Skill ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sniper" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and aimed cautiously.</p>
<p id="line_3713">“Heh, rest assured, the order I received was to capture you. I suppose the goal was to interrogate you for information, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is a kind man. If you were to tell us everything we wanted to know, he wouldn’t take your life.”</p>
<p id="line_3714">“You’ve got balls talking all big at this point!” Glenda roared as she pulled the trigger.</p>
<p id="line_3715">Three bullets aimed for his head and two for his heart. Five magic bullets in total were fired as planned. The bullets were shot and instantly warped in space, appearing in front of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as well as the right of his head. There were also bullets shot directly in front of his heart and to his left flank.</p>
<p id="line_3716">All five bullets tore into his body.</p>
<p id="line_3717">Warp Bullet—Glenda’s ultimate technique. The magic bullets spawned from mana were different from normal bullets and would disrupt magicule. Even if her opponent could regenerate, they wouldn’t be able to revive after being hit.</p>
<p id="line_3718">No matter if her opponent were a master of knife and gun play, when getting hit by supersonic bullets coming from all directions, even the best amongst the elite would not be able to handle it.</p>
<p id="line_3719">Glenda had come to understand her capabilities from her past experiences. That was the secret to her survival. For this reason, Glenda was certain that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had met his end.</p>

She was relieved. Since she had laid eyes on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she had felt a deep feeling of unease. Even though it was not as sharp as when she ran into <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, her instinct told her that her opponent was dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_3721">“You are done. Since you were strong, I didn’t want to hold back,” Glenda muttered after feeling greatly reassured.</p>
<p id="line_3722">Yet it seemed that she had done so too early.</p>
<p id="line_3723">A voice that, by all common sense, should not have been heard was raised behind her.</p>
<p id="line_3724">“Is that so? Then you shall promptly admit defeat and let me capture you.”</p>
<p id="line_3725">Glenda jumped away subconsciously. She turned back quickly and found <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> standing there.</p>
<p id="line_3726">“H-how is this possible! Didn’t you just die…?”</p>
<p id="line_3727">“Heh, you’re just full of jokes, aren’t you? How could that weak of an attack have killed me? In the first place, there’s no reason for me to lose to a cheap shot like you.”</p>
<p id="line_3728">“Then I’ll do it again—eh, what?!”</p>
<p id="line_3729">Glenda’s line was cut short.</p>
<p id="line_3730">It was to be expected. To her disbelief, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s aura began to spread all around her.

<p id="line_3731">“N-no way! How can this be, why are you everywhere? What kind of joke is this! What kind of Skill is this!”</p>
<p id="line_3732">“It’s very simple. I have a Skill called ‘Clone.’ And that was it.

<p id="line_3733">“Damn it all—!”</p>
<p id="line_3734">After shouting in a tone devoid of womanly charm, she launched her attack at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3736">On a balcony overlooking the blooming flowers in the courtyard, a young girl, a young man, and an old man stood around a round table, looking intently at each other.</p>

<p id="line_3782">“T-that would be…!”</p>
<p id="line_3783">Upon hearing her explanation, Johann finally realized the severity of the matter.</p>
<p id="line_3784">In this world, due to the common threat of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, kingdoms seldom battled amongst themselves.

<p id="line_3786">“Moreover, the strength of this nation is not their military alone. To be bound by rules is the equivalent of losing freedom. However, if they were to make the rules themselves, surely, that would mean their nation would not be at any loss, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_3787">Even if Tempest decided to follow the rules set up by the council, the future remained unknown.

<p id="line_3789">Or through military force.</p>
<p id="line_3790">Or with economic pressure.</p>

<p id="line_3919">This kind of reminded me. There was some online game in the past where you could cheat through game exploits. You could change your health points to infinite, giving your opponent the hope of winning while you grinned behind the screen.</p>
<p id="line_3920"><em>I’m so close to winning</em>—that was the most sinister thing to make your opponent think. And your opponent would try so hard during the fight, using every last one of their items.</p>
<p id="line_3921">That’s exactly what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did, but he must have been trying to get relevant information about the culprit.</p>

<p id="line_3926">Oh yeah, now that he’d mentioned it, I <em>did</em> say something like that to him. I recalled that it might have been the plot of some spy movies…or was it video games? Didn’t really matter since I seemed to have forgotten about it.</p>

<p id="line_3941">“Yes, that’s it. It doesn’t seem like magic. I assumed that it was a weapon from another world.”</p>
<p id="line_3942">«Answer. It is likely that the individual ‘Glenda’ used mana to craft it. It may be slightly different, but with Skills such as ‘Weapon Specification,’ one can construct weapons from memory.»</p>
<p id="line_3943"><em>W-weapon specification? So not only does she have sniper skills, she even had a trump card like that?</em></p>
<p id="line_3944">By the way, if it was the authentic ‘Weapon Specification,’ she would’ve been able to reconstruct weapons from her memory perfectly. Yet what Glenda had recreated didn’t seem delicate enough and could only act as a pale imitation. Nonetheless, it still posed a threat.</p>

<p id="line_3950">I had yet to publicly disclose the existence of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.

<p id="line_3951">“It’s instinct! When you reach my level, your instincts become super sharp.”</p>
<p id="line_3952">My words evoked looks of admiration from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others.

<p id="line_3953">“Never mind. Putting that aside, can I interrogate her as well?

<p id="line_3954"><em>Looks like she ignored me.</em></p>
<p id="line_3955">If she had things to ask Glenda, she should go ahead.

<p id="line_3956">Glenda’s claims suggest that she had fought against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the past, but she managed to run away early on.

<p id="line_3957">—Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said that he had already let her have a taste of fear.</p>
<p id="line_3958">Not physically, but mentally. Surely, Glenda’s pride must be in tatters.</p>
<p id="line_3959">That said, whether we should let her go was also a difficult choice. She was stronger than we expected, so it would be dangerous to just let her run wild. In any case, it didn’t seem right to hand her over to the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. For now, I figured we should keep her.</p>
<p id="line_3960">“Okay, are you coming with us?” I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3961">“Then do indulge me,” she nodded.</p>
<p id="line_3962">Anyhow, depending on her attitude, we would decide what to do after we checked up on her.</p>
<p id="line_3963">On that note, we decided to switch venues.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3964">—By the way, I was the one to pay the bill at the café.</p>

<p id="line_3985">I didn’t intend to do that kind of thing to a woman. Moreover, Glenda didn’t seem so stubborn as to not reveal anything. Perhaps with negotiation, we could get her to reveal the truth.</p>

<p id="line_3989">Glenda knew <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so I figured that she must have escaped knowing she wouldn’t win.

<p id="line_3990">I was also curious about why Glenda betrayed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Even if she didn’t reveal the identity of the employer behind this assassination, she might reveal some other information.

<p class="space-break" id="line_3991">After settling down with that idea, I posed the first question in a calm tone.</p>

<p id="line_3994">“You were going to create the illusion that it was my doing to chase us out of the Western Nations, is that why?”</p>
<p id="line_3995">“Perhaps. I didn’t ask for the reasons. Someone just ordered me to do that.”</p>
<p id="line_3996">I see, she didn’t seem to be lying.</p>

<p id="line_3999">“What are you going to ask?”</p>
<p id="line_4000">“I put you in charge of the business hub cities, gave you the freedom of operating in an environment where you wouldn’t be bound, and told you ‘not to trust words of merchants’ easily. But you were already bribed at that point, weren’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_4001">“No comment.”</p>
<p id="line_4002">“You were going to betray us from the start, weren’t you? Was it from someone’s order?”</p>
<p id="line_4003">“—No comment.”</p>
<p id="line_4004">“I figure that your employer is probably also running the council behind the scenes, so what’s his true identity?”</p>
<p id="line_4005">“…”</p>
<p id="line_4006">“I have been onto you for some time.

<p id="line_4007">“Didn’t I just say? No comment!”</p>
<p id="line_4008">“Is that so?

<p id="line_4047">That was true. Though, that said, she couldn’t reveal the details of the Skills if her opponent didn’t activate them. She could, nonetheless, still tell the strength of her opponent’s Skills and identify whether it was an Extra Skill or a Unique Skill.</p>
<p id="line_4048">But when a single person possessed more than two Unique Skills, it became hard to discern whether you were dealing with one extremely powerful Unique Skill, or multiple—the details seemed to be more difficult to obtain.</p>
<p id="line_4049">I had similar Skills myself. The accuracy of my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ had increased, and now I could vaguely read my opponent’s Skills.

<p id="line_4050">It was like how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Guy" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Crimson disguised his magicule capacity.

<p id="line_4051">But that was not the case at all.

<p id="line_4063">“No comment—even though I want to say this, I have to admit that you are correct.”</p>
<p id="line_4064">“Thank you. Then let us continue. There was a guy who was corrupted by ‘desire’ during the nation founding festival as well. That man’s name was Gai.

<p id="line_4066">It may be a different case for someone as completely corrupted as Gai, but as the distance increased, the effect of the Skill would weaken.</p>

<p id="line_4068">However, the effect of ‘desire’ purely relied on the power of the Skill. You could probably intensify the influence with the clever use of sophistry and the like.</p>
<p id="line_4069">To put it simply, it was highly likely that this individual had attended the nation founding festival. This did make a lot of sense. In this way, I could only think of one suspect.

<p id="line_4125">If she were to insist on remaining hostile towards us, I would just take care of her in time. I didn’t feel all that troubled by her actions, so I decided to forgive her this time.</p>

Since I had forgiven her, she probably couldn’t do something that meant otherwise.</p>
<p id="line_4127">In some sense, Glenda was merely following orders. She was not making decisions herself, but was acting under the restrictive control of the ‘Curse.’ Therefore, we should be light with her punishment.</p>
<p id="line_4128">“That’s all, you are free to go. Feel free to stay in our nation if you feel like it, but if you were to cause any trouble—”</p>
<p id="line_4129">“W-wait a minute—no, please hold on a second! Are you really letting me go?”</p>
<p id="line_4130">“Umm, killing you doesn’t seem all that meaningful.”</p>

<p id="line_4132">“You alone won’t pose too much of a threat anyway,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> added on to my words.</p>
<p id="line_4133">Even though the way they put it was rather off, they seemed to be okay with this verdict. They probably felt that Glenda posed no threat. While that may sound harsh, it was, in truth, the reality of the situation. She didn’t stand a chance against a serious <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and she obviously wouldn’t win against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Glenda herself seemed to be mindful of keeping her life. She wouldn’t be stupid enough to challenge someone she couldn’t beat. That was why we were fine with letting her go.</p>
<p id="line_4134">Facing me, Glenda suddenly dropped to her knees.</p>
<p id="line_4135">The words she then spilled were shocking.</p>
<p id="line_4136">“I-I have a request! I will tell you everything I know, so can you please hire me? I’ll do any dirty work you have, anything, please!”</p>
<p id="line_4137">Hearing this, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I looked at each other, dumbstruck.</p>
<p id="line_4138"><em>What should I do?</em></p>
<p id="line_4139"><em>It’s your call.</em></p>
<p id="line_4140">We were exchanging information with our eyes.</p>
<p id="line_4141">Even if she wanted us to hire her, we didn’t really have the money. My pocket money had increased by a lot, but we were still reviewing our executives’ paychecks.</p>
<p id="line_4142">We were a super sweat-shoppy corporation—I mean nation.</p>
<p id="line_4143">“Uhh—I’m glad to hear your enthusiasm, but we are still developing. We are slow in terms of designing systems, so there is no salary for now…”</p>
<p id="line_4144">You gotta be clear when it came to this type of question. It wouldn’t help if I were to act rich, so I told her the truth.</p>
<p id="line_4145">“—Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_4146">Glenda was frozen in disbelief.</p>
<p id="line_4147">Be that as it may—what Glenda said next shocked us instead.</p>
<p id="line_4148">“Oh, I’m used to that already. Even though I was a member of the Pope’s Imperial Order and a member of the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I wasn’t getting paid anyway…”</p>
<p id="line_4149">I didn’t expect that someone with such high status as the ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Three Martial Sages" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ wasn’t even getting paid.</p>
<p id="line_4150">As it turns out, everything was paid with actual goods; any money they had, was collected by themselves. However, they could use their reputation to get a national guest level of treatment in the Western Nations. They could also receive prizes for stopping crimes, and overall, it sounded like they were well off.</p>
<p id="line_4151">“Eh, does that mean <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hasn’t collected much money either?”</p>
<p id="line_4152"><em>But didn’t she spend a ton during the festival?</em></p>
<p id="line_4153">“—Tsk, yeah. In <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we promote the idea that everyone is equal, so we won’t pay in cash in public trades. Everyone just uses goods as currency.”</p>
<p id="line_4154">I was surprised, but also reassured. If a kingdom as long-lived as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could work without paying salaries, surely, we were not in a hurry to design our own systems.</p>
<p id="line_4155">By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was in charge of running the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight Order" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, with the additional role as the head knight of the imperial order. She seemed to be able to access the national treasury to some extent. With the additional earnings from fulfilling <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> contracts throughout the day, she could earn plenty of money.</p>
<p id="line_4156">“So, you are still asking me to pay even when you are making so much money?”</p>
<p id="line_4157">“Why do you care so much! It’s called being frugal, frugal!”</p>
<p id="line_4158">She was willing to spend money treating the kids but was super stingy with me.</p>
<p id="line_4159">By the way, have I given any bonus to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?</p>
<p id="line_4160">I thought to myself, but I figured it would be too much trouble and decided not to dwell on it.</p>
<p id="line_4161">“Despite how I look, I’m quite infamous among the Western Nations,” Glenda exclaimed. “That’s why, even if you let me go, I probably won’t find a single job offer. After all, most nations probably wouldn’t dare to hire me. The adventurer lifestyle doesn’t really suit me either. Moreover, this place probably has the highest level of culture around. I’ll be satisfied if you just provide me with the basic necessities,” Glenda said with apparent desperation. She didn’t seem to be lying.</p>
<p id="line_4162">This did seem reasonable. No matter how you saw it, a ‘Martial <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ who was chased out of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would appear to be a traitor to the world’s eyes. There was no way any nation would dare to hire someone as dangerous as that.</p>
<p id="line_4163">Even if she were to hide her identity and become an adventurer, it would still be a life of unending fear. If she were to expose her identity accidentally, either <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would likely send people after her.</p>
<p id="line_4164">Either way, she wouldn’t be able to live a peaceful life.</p>
<p id="line_4165">“That’s true, you probably will have a hard time surviving if no one wants to help you.”</p>
<p id="line_4166">“Tell me about it.

<p id="line_4167"><em>How could I believe you?</em></p>
<p id="line_4168">But to be honest, you couldn’t exactly hate her. She was like the unfortunate woman that appeared in the spy movies. You just couldn’t leave her behind.</p>

<p id="line_4170">“If <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama wishes so, I will not object.”</p>
<p id="line_4171">“Then I’ll be counting on you. It’ll be troublesome if she were to betray us, so please prepare accordingly.”</p>
<p id="line_4172">“Understood. Her combat prowess outshines <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, therefore she can be under my command and help expand our secret services.”</p>
<p id="line_4173">“A secret service that exclusively recruits problem children?”</p>
<p id="line_4174">“Well, sort of. I want to use what is available in front of me as opposed to spending the effort recruiting otherwise.”</p>
<p id="line_4175">Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had gone to search for subordinates.

<p id="line_4176">So I let him go ahead.</p>
<p id="line_4177">“Then you shall handle this in its entirety!

<p id="line_4178">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_4179">The matter was settled quickly.</p>
<p id="line_4180">“Oi, how can you call me a problem child when I’m right here…” I heard Glenda muttering.</p>
<p id="line_4181"><em>If you have a problem with that, try winning over my trust first.</em></p>
<p id="line_4182">And just like that, I decided to recruit Glenda.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4183">I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to manage Glenda, but before that, I needed her to give us all the information she knew. Since this was no longer an interrogation, we simply had a normal conversation over dinner.</p>
<p id="line_4184">“You grab one of these wooden tags with the type of meals written on it and exchange it for food at the window over there. There are three different types of meals, which we switch up every day. There are special meal sets as well. If you were to become an officer of some sort, you can order any food you like.”</p>
<p id="line_4185">“Eh, is that so? They have been preparing meals for me every time?”</p>
<p id="line_4186">They always seemed to have a lot of fun eating, but had never used the wooden tag to order anything. But this was the lieutenants’ canteen, someone would prepare meals for them even if they didn’t order anything.</p>
<p id="line_4187">The creation of new dishes by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s and Gobichi’s own kitchens was a story for another day.</p>
<p id="line_4188">“This is our most popular dish. You need to make an appointment using your effort points or come early to wait in line to get it. It’s a specially made dish,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> explained with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_4189">I was gonna say that the dessert in the combo made it seem very extravagant. I realized why that was the case after hearing her explanation.</p>
<p id="line_4190">“We can all have this set.”</p>
<p id="line_4191">“Yes. We’ve ordered people to reserve them for us.”</p>
<p id="line_4192">I saw that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> both were ordering the special meal. I was caught on the fact that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> just said something about ‘Ordering people to reserve them.’ Could it be that he had ordered his subordinates to wait in line for him? I should probably just believe in the idea that he wouldn’t be stupid enough to order people to fight over meals at the canteen.</p>
<p id="line_4193">With the meals served to our table, we began to dine.</p>
<p id="line_4194">“Now then, let’s talk—”</p>
<p id="line_4195">I turned to Glenda as I was about to ask her something. There I saw that her eyes had lit up and all her attention was focused on the meal.</p>
<p id="line_4196">It was really delicious. No wonder it was listed as a special. I supposed it was best to talk about happier topics during the meal. So I questioned her after we ate.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4197">After we finished dining.</p>
<p id="line_4198">“I used to put money above all, but that thought was changed today. From today onward, I’m gonna live for points!”</p>
<p id="line_4199"><em>Just to clarify, in case you were being serious, they are not that easy to collect.</em></p>
<p id="line_4200">But, fine, whatever. If it made her put in her best efforts, I’d say <em>go for it</em>.</p>
<p id="line_4201">“What secrets do you know? Do not hide anything, tell us everything,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> prompted Glenda, which finally got her to open up about the secrets she knew.</p>
<p id="line_4202">The contents she revealed gave us a surprise.</p>
<p id="line_4203">First, regarding the council. It was under the control of the five leaders of an organization called the Five Great Elders. The head of the Five Great Elders was the aforementioned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4204">As for the remaining four, to our surprise, we learned that today’s prime suspect, count <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gavan" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, was one of them. And in contrast, the duke of the Kingdom of Rostia, Johann, was also a member of the Five Great Elders.</p>
<p id="line_4205">“How come the Five Great Elders were in disagreement with each other?”</p>
<p id="line_4206">“That was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s plan. She intentionally organized an opposition while also keeping someone aligned with the majority view. In truth, this was her faking disputes, but to the people involved, this was a real battle where the stakes were life or death.”</p>
<p id="line_4207">I see… Was she doing so to make her organization more effective?</p>
<p id="line_4208">At first, it could seem to be efficient to make an organization with one sole goal. However, it was likely to eventually stagnate and become a breeding bed of corruption.</p>
<p id="line_4209">For example, it was often seen that one bad leader could bring down a whole business.</p>
<p id="line_4210">Also, if Johann managed to win my trust, it would’ve been easier for them to keep tabs on me. For them, it would have been great if they were able to eliminate me, but now, they would probably make plans for Johann to conspire from inside the council.</p>
<p id="line_4211">“That feels so shady.”</p>
<p id="line_4212">“I seriously don’t want to deal with these people, I want to burn them all.”</p>
<p id="line_4213">It was annoying just to hear about these kinds of things.</p>
<p id="line_4214">This was probably how the nobles operated, to eliminate people whose alignment was unclear. I might have trusted Johann if I had not heard about this information. It was the correct choice to have absolved Glenda.</p>
<p id="line_4215">The other two members of the five were the count of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Cidre" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was in charge of guarding the northern border of the Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dolan" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was from a small kingdom in the west.

<p id="line_4216">With these two power houses stationed in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it was obvious how much thought <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had put into the structure of this land. It was next to the Holy Empire of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and far from the Great Jura Forest.

<p id="line_4217">“But why is he antagonizing me?

<h1 class="ch-name">The Trap of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Greed" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span></h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_4311">I gathered all of my lieutenants and shared the information with them.</p>
<p id="line_4312">I also introduced Glenda to everyone. Of course, this also meant that she was under surveillance from now on. Glenda would have to win our trust through her own effort in the future.</p>
<p id="line_4313">I introduced her to Kaijin and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well and let them inspect Glenda’s pistol. Now, they could probably help supply some ammo for her.</p>
<p id="line_4314"><em>Perhaps we could end up mass-producing pistols?</em></p>
<p id="line_4315">I really wanted to own guns, to be honest, but I had no interest in letting them flow freely in the market. Instead, I would only distribute it to important people through a license system.</p>
<p id="line_4316">It looked very cool, so I wanted one.</p>
<p id="line_4317">As I was getting dorky with these ideas, time passed on quickly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4318">It was the day to explore the ancient ruin. Everything was ready.</p>
<p id="line_4319">I looked great in my explorer outfit. I even had a prototype of the pistol. Kaijin took an interest in the matter and used the free time in between his research and made the model. Dold engraved the model and installed a mechanism that could cause small explosions via mana.</p>
<p id="line_4320">Since gunpowder wasn’t being used, there was no need to discharge a shell casing. Now all you needed to do was to insert the oval-shaped bullets. Its caliber was around nine millimeters, and you could load sixteen rounds. The blowback that happened every time you shot had the purpose of reducing the sudden recoil of firing as well as chambering the next bullet.</p>
<p id="line_4321">It was crafted like a toy, but its power could rival that of a .44 magnum. This was all because of the magisteel that was used to craft the gun, allowing it to withstand a high enough impact. The engravings that delivered the magical explosion were tuned to the maximum force possible, which is what granted the weapon its devastating power.</p>
<p id="line_4322">Different types of ammo had different magnitudes of power. Under normal circumstances, one could use the plain lead bullet. The mithril bullets, which were enchanted with mana, were specially made to deal with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The amount of mana infused would change the strength of the bullet, meaning the weapon was highly adaptable depending on what target you were fighting.</p>
<p id="line_4323">The weapon’s rating was rare-grade, but it could attack with the firepower of a unique-grade weapon. It was an interesting choice of arms for sure.</p>
<p id="line_4324">It even surprised Kaijin and the others who made it. Its power had made us consider listing it as the official gear for our new recruits. However, just as I stated prior, this decision needed to be contemplated carefully. To put it bluntly, it was hardly a noteworthy addition to our arsenal. In a sense, it was just a fanciful weapon.</p>
<p id="line_4325">I was hesitant to make it an official sidearm. The idea was to only lend them out if it was deemed necessary, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p id="line_4326">Yep, like this time.</p>
<p id="line_4327">The right gear is what gave us a certain flare.</p>
<p id="line_4328">Pursuing the fantastical is man’s aesthetic<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Refer to previous explanation of ‘Men’s romance’" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>

<p id="line_4358">“Uh, nothing’s wrong, but, it’s just that…”</p>
<p id="line_4359">“…?”</p>

<p id="line_4361">She was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinate, so just in case, we listed her as a suspect. Just now, my conversation with Milim was to have her confirm whether there was anything fishy about our suspect using her ‘Dragon Eye.’</p>
<p id="line_4362">Milim seemed to have noticed something strange, but apparently there was no major issue. I still wasn’t entirely reassured, so I thought that I’d best stay on guard for now.</p>
<p id="line_4363">“My team has gathered as well, allow me to introduce you to them.”</p>
<p id="line_4364">After gazing at us in a rather unexplainable way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san began to introduce the teammates.</p>
<p id="line_4365">At the square near the HQ, a line of people was awaiting orders. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san had trained an exploration team and had hand-picked some of the most outstanding individuals to accompany us during the upcoming exploration operation.</p>
<p id="line_4366">Even though I made it clear to them that we may get ambushed, these people still came nonetheless, almost fearless. They were a mixed group of around ten members. All the passersby were looking at them curiously, but none of the teammates took note of the stares. They looked to be well trained.</p>
<p id="line_4367">Their attire could only be described as “Armed to the teeth.”</p>
<p id="line_4368">They were all heavily geared, unlike our “casual equipment.”</p>
<p id="line_4369">Covered in very thick and heavy clothes from head to toe, they were carrying all sorts of bulky backpacks. Among their tools, they brought canes, crowbars, shovels, and many other useful items.</p>
<p id="line_4370">“Then, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I shall have someone carry your luggage for you. Where have you put it?”</p>
<p id="line_4371"><em>We didn’t bring any luggage, just new clothes.</em></p>
<p id="line_4372">“No, we didn’t really prepare anything in particular, this will do.”</p>
<p id="line_4373">“What? Surely you jest.”</p>
<p id="line_4374"><em>No no no, it’s no use telling me that now…</em></p>
<p id="line_4375">“It’s not a good idea to show your bare skin. With all those bug bites and stuff, you’re more likely to get hurt, aren’t you?”</p>
<p id="line_4376">The explorer outfits excelled at covering their skin. Sloppy clothing was also a no-go.</p>
<p id="line_4377">“Uh—will it though? My skin’s protected by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so it shouldn’t matter!”</p>
<p id="line_4378">“Umm—but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san is angry though!”</p>
<p id="line_4379">“You too! In my opinion, your gear is way too light! Both of you are underestimating the exploration business.”</p>
<p id="line_4380"><em>I don’t get it. They are nitpicking problems with such a fervor, but what were our mistakes?</em></p>
<p id="line_4381">“Ahh, please calm down, it’s all right. Despite how I look, I’m actually a fairly experienced adventurer!”</p>
<p id="line_4382">To be fair, since we weren’t going camping, it would be fine to wear light clothing. But I didn’t need to say it out loud, I’d just show her when the time comes, surely, they would understand.</p>
<p id="line_4383">“Since you say so… However, if you run into any trouble, please tell me immediately.”</p>
<p id="line_4384"><em>We probably won’t run into any trouble.</em></p>
<p id="line_4385">I only considered this a hike, but I did keep my guard up.</p>
<p id="line_4386">I had also warned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Ranga, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as well.</p>
<p id="line_4387"><em>Now then, let’s get on with our hike.</em></p>
<p id="line_4388">“Then let’s prepare the horse carriages—”</p>
<p id="line_4389">“Eh? Do we really need that?”</p>

<p id="line_4391">I was confused as well. Because it would take around two months to travel to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Jistav" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> by horse-drawn carriage, I didn’t intend to do that from the start.</p>
<p id="line_4392">“What do you mean by that?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san asked.</p>
<p id="line_4393">I then asked them to move to the outskirts of the city first.

I had gotten pretty handy using this now and could link up locations I had already been to very quickly.</p>
<p id="line_4394">“Please go through this. It won’t disappear anytime soon, so you guys can walk through just fine.”</p>
<p id="line_4395">Upon finishing my sentence, the members of the exploration team who had been watching the outcome in stunned amazement began to stir.</p>
<p id="line_4396">“You gotta be kidding! I don’t even know how far it is from here to there…”</p>

<p id="line_4398">“This is such overkill. So, all of our preparations have been for nothing…”</p>

<p id="line_4404">“Of course, everyone should get their own room. If need be, we’ve also prepared a bigger room.”</p>

<p id="line_4409">With the chief’s instructions, we let her guide us to the large room. There I had all the teammates put down their luggage. They did as they were told and put down their luggage in an almost robotic fashion.</p>

<p id="line_4412">“Eh, eh? One room per person, eh? Are we being treated as guests in this castle?”</p>
<p id="line_4413">Just now I was saying that they were acting like robots, but it seemed they were just unable to catch up with what was going on. Their heads must’ve been spinning as their whole world was turned upside-down.</p>
<p id="line_4414">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama ordered me to take care of everyone here, if you were to experience any inconvenience, there is no need to restrain yourself. Please let us know,” the chief said with a gentle smile to assuage the flabbergasted teammates.</p>
<p id="line_4415">That was the moment it clicked for them, and they finally decided to accept the reality of the situation. Seeing them like this, I couldn’t help but giggle.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4416">Afterwards, I took the group to check out the castle with a guide.</p>
<p id="line_4417">As expected from the home base of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman, I could only describe it as extravagant. The dark elves were managing the castle with care. Not a speck of dust could be found.</p>
<p id="line_4418">“Milim, when the expedition is over, you will be in charge of this place. However, the local residents asked to continue living here.”</p>
<p id="line_4419">“Umm, I know, I will have people deliver food and supplies regularly.”</p>
<p id="line_4420">“Thank you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Milim-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_4421">“You’re welcome. You are my citizens as well; I’m just doing my job.”</p>
<p id="line_4422"><em>Oh oh, even Milim has become an astute ruler. It must all be thanks to Frey-san’s efforts.</em></p>
<p id="line_4423">Apart from being impressed by Milim, I also asked some other questions, such as whether there would be any inconveniences.</p>
<p id="line_4424">This castle was vast, big enough for all the dark elves to live in. There were no castle towns to speak of. There seemed to be places for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to live in, but they were all working for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> now. I heard that the dark elves were managing these residential areas as well, for them to live in the day they returned.</p>
<p id="line_4425">“This is the entrance to the ruins. There are three levels in total, the bottom floor seems to be a tomb. We were only able to enter the upper floor, since for the middle floor and below, only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman knew what was held there.”</p>
<p id="line_4426"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also reported that the entrance to the ruins was inside the castle.</p>
<p id="line_4427">“Then have you figured out the layout of the upper floor?”</p>
<p id="line_4428">“Yes, all of the treasure from the upper floor was collected. Right now, we are using it as living quarters.”</p>
<p id="line_4429">I heard that there were many empty rooms, enough to easily fit over a thousand men.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4430">I opened the door and walked straight inside. In spite of this location being underground, it was filled with a gentle glow.</p>
<p id="line_4431">“What is this light—?”</p>
<p id="line_4432">“Your Majesty, this is the permanent effect of magic creation. It seems to be linked with the orbit of the sun as it does get dimmer at night.”</p>
<p id="line_4433">“What? So ancient magic is still at work here!”</p>
<p id="line_4434">“Th-this alone should be a major discovery. Even though it’s being utilized so naturally, I still want to investigate it thoroughly.”</p>
<p id="line_4435">“Then, is there also magic like this present in the middle floor and below as well?”</p>
<p id="line_4436">“Yes, when we sent off Clayman-sama, I secretly had a peek at it. The middle floor was very bright as well.”</p>
<p id="line_4437">The chief answered my every question. This lasted for a while.</p>
<p id="line_4438">The exploration team was ecstatic. This excitement must’ve been contagious, as we began to feel it too.</p>
<p id="line_4439">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun, don’t you be a troublemaker now!”</p>
<p id="line_4440">“Understood! But I am feeling a bit nervous.”</p>
<p id="line_4441">We talked amongst ourselves in hushed voices as we began to tour the first floor. It was very lively, showing signs that the dark elves really were living down here.</p>
<p id="line_4442">“Won’t <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> emerge from underground if you guys were to reside here? The word tomb alone makes me feel that there may be ghosts.”</p>
<p id="line_4443"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s question prompted the chief to crack a wry smile.</p>
<p id="line_4444">“No, we wouldn’t be concerned about that. There’s only one entrance to the underground, and only Clayman-sama was able to open it.”</p>
<p id="line_4445">“Oh—then why not just break it if you can’t open it!”</p>
<p id="line_4446">“Leave it to me, I’ll slash it open right away!”</p>
<p id="line_4447">“No! We have to investigate carefully, not just wrecking things!”</p>
<p id="line_4448">I stopped such an aggressive suggestion.</p>
<p id="line_4449">“Y-you have a point. Let’s be careful now, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_4450">“That was close. I would have cut it down had you not warned me.”</p>
<p id="line_4451">This made me feel rather uneasy, but it seemed everything would be fine as long as I explained things well to them.</p>
<p id="line_4452">And so, we headed through the cavernous ruins.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4453">Passing the residential area of the dark elves, a giant gate appeared before us. Its size was about the same as the first gate. Only this time, the door seemed to have been enchanted with some sort of spell.</p>
<p id="line_4454">“—I see. This appears to have been enchanted with an ancient magic defense mechanism. If you accidentally disturb this contraption, the defensive mechanisms within the city may activate.”</p>
<p id="line_4455">“Defensive mechanisms? Are they still functioning?”</p>
<p id="line_4456">“Yes, please be very careful. If we were to trigger it accidentally, we may no longer be able to investigate the ruins,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san advised everyone with a serious face. The team also seemed rather tense upon hearing her words.</p>
<p id="line_4457">I was more curious about how Clayman opened this gate.</p>
<p id="line_4458">“Is Clayman connected to these ruins in any way?”</p>
<p id="line_4459">“That guy only rose to power recently; he shouldn’t have anything to do with such ancient ruins.”</p>
<p id="line_4460">“Perhaps he was able to decode the sorcery and open the door with the correct procedure.”</p>
<p id="line_4461">Hmm-hmm.</p>
<p id="line_4462">That’s right, even if it were Clayman, surely, he would’ve been able to undo the sorcery with enough time.</p>
<p id="line_4463"><em>By the way, I recall that Clayman had a Unique Skill as well.</em></p>
<p id="line_4464">«Correct. He possessed Unique Skill ‘Manipulator’; he could receive or transmit information in encoded signals.»</p>
<p id="line_4465"><em>Yeah yeah yeah, that’s it.</em></p>
<p id="line_4466">It was some ability about analyzing intelligence, surely, it would be just as simple to analyze magic spells.</p>
<p id="line_4467"><em>By the way, did I obtain the Skill as well?</em></p>
<p id="line_4468">«Answer. It is an inferior version of master’s Skill; thus, it has been decomposed into energy and absorbed. If anything, the Skill ‘Ley Line Manipulation’ has been added to ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Law Manipulation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’»</p>
<p id="line_4469"><em>I see, no wonder it didn’t report it to me.</em></p>
<p id="line_4470">Because it wasn’t worth mentioning. That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san never brought it up. But if Clayman could do it, so could I. Even though this would be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san doing all the actual work.</p>
<p id="line_4471">“We may be stuck figuring this thing out for a long time.”</p>
<p id="line_4472">“We ran headfirst into a mighty challenging task. But our circumstances are already a lot better than what we’ve done in the past. Let’s calm down and analyze it carefully!”</p>
<p id="line_4473">The members of the exploration team talked amongst themselves in a display of motivation.</p>
<p id="line_4474">Ignoring them all, I put my hand on the gate. I instantly got a picture of the energy coming from the ‘ley lines’ permeating the wall in the form of magic spells.</p>
<p id="line_4475">“I get it now. If we were to destroy this door, the lights on this level would all vanish. All of the energy would be used to repel the invaders before reconstructing itself. It’s still functioning normally even after more than a thousand years. Looks like this is a super advanced product born from the magic-wielding civilization.”</p>
<p id="line_4476">It was all Greek to me, but thanks to the help of the all-talented <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, I was able to unravel the matter easily. It was like playing a puzzle game, making it somewhat intriguing.</p>
<p id="line_4477">Like solving an arithmetic problem. I undid the magic expressions one by one and finally found the way to open the gate.</p>
<p id="line_4478">“Ah, there you go. By channeling magic here, we should be able to open the input window of the coded spell.”</p>
<p id="line_4479">I finished my sentence only to turn around and see the expedition team with their mouths hanging open.</p>
<p id="line_4480"><em>Oh snap, I overdid that a bit</em>—I suddenly realized.</p>
<p id="line_4481">I accidentally started analyzing due to it being so interesting. This was supposed to be their job.</p>
<p id="line_4482">“Sorry, I got ahead of myself…”</p>
<p id="line_4483">“I-it’s okay, don’t worry about it,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san said to comfort me, but I still felt that I owed an apology to everyone.</p>
<p id="line_4484">I reflected upon what I’d done while petting Ranga as I patiently waited.</p>
<p id="line_4485">—That’s what I should have done. But my own teammates couldn’t contain themselves.</p>
<p id="line_4486">“WAHAHAHA! I want to solve it as well!”</p>
<p id="line_4487">“I give up.”</p>
<p id="line_4488">Milim started shouting loudly, prancing before the gate, while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t figure out a thing.</p>
<p id="line_4489">That seemed to cheer up the other teammates and they began to discuss. The spark to drive the situation was the question <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san asked, “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, could I ask you about something? How did you analyze the puzzle?”</p>
<p id="line_4490">By then I was stroking Ranga’s fur. But since she’d asked, I couldn’t very well withhold an answer. To quench her thirst for clarification, I explained the analysis method in detail.</p>
<p id="line_4491">“First, we need to investigate what sort of magical expressions were used before it came to be, then we could sort those expressions into different stages.”</p>
<p id="line_4492">“Do you mean to identify the most recently used magical expression?”</p>
<p id="line_4493">“Right, we then probe what should be removed from the end-product to prevent that magical expression from activating. Repeat this process for the expression before it and so on until you grasp the foundation—that is the underlying flow, the nucleus, of this mechanism. Then, after that, it will conversely give you only the right answers.”</p>
<p id="line_4494">“I see…”</p>
<p id="line_4495">“Ruling out false leads and only preserving the expressions that are functioning correctly, is it?”</p>
<p id="line_4496">No wonder why everyone present here was an elite, they immediately understood the method merely from listening to my short suggestion.</p>
<p id="line_4497">“Aren’t trap-type expressions complete on their own in many cases? They are like branches and leaves of a large tree that grow close together, parts that do not belong to the central roots and the trunk. This is, assuming that the expressions are not primarily intended to trigger the trap.”</p>
<p id="line_4498">“…I see. So even if it’s the main stem of the expressions, we still shouldn’t let our guard down.”</p>
<p id="line_4499">My teaching style seemed to be easy to understand, maybe because I had experience teaching kids. I was pleased to see that it was pretty well received, so I continued to demonstrate more and more of the puzzle analysis.</p>
<p id="line_4500">During this time, Milim opened the gate almost immediately. Later on, a couple of our teammates managed to open the door successfully as well. It was then that the chief called us.</p>
<p id="line_4501">“Everyone, we have prepared meals. You must be tired after your arduous journey; shall we call it a day?”</p>
<p id="line_4502">Having it pointed out, I realized it was already evening.</p>
<p id="line_4503">She had a point, we could begin our exploration officially tomorrow. We would open the gate tomorrow and close up shop for now.</p>
<p id="line_4504">“Shall we stop for the day?”</p>
<p id="line_4505">“I concur. Her saying that we’ve been on ‘an arduous journey’ still feels bizarre, nonetheless. We shall begin the investigation officially tomorrow.”</p>
<p id="line_4506">With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s consent, the day came to a close.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4507">The next day.</p>
<p id="line_4508">Our team lined up and prepared for marching. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san unsealed the gate on our behalf. The blue light flashed repeatedly as the gate silently opened.</p>
<p id="line_4509">“Looks like it was a success.”</p>
<p id="line_4510">The folks began to cheer.</p>
<p id="line_4511">“Good job,” I praised everyone as I took a step inside the gate.</p>
<p id="line_4512">The middle floor had a different level of luminosity compared to the upper floor. There were candlesticks on the stone walls emitting faint light that couldn’t be extinguished. This was some fantastic magic technology. But they were not actual candles, rather, illumination created by magic.</p>
<p id="line_4513">While feeling impressed, I walked towards the floor as Milim came to my side.</p>
<p id="line_4514">“I feel like there’s suddenly a really strong sense of oppression here.”</p>
<p id="line_4515">“It’s true. Because unlike the upper floor, the ceiling is really low, and the hallway is surrounded by stone walls. The passage is really narrow as well, it almost feels like a labyrinth.”</p>
<p id="line_4516">The ceiling was only two meters tall. A larger man would have to bend his back. The hallway was only two meters wide as well. It was a bit narrow for two people to stand shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p id="line_4517">Not like that was a problem for me and Milim due to our petite figures. But the teammates behind us carrying large backpacks may have some trouble doing the same.</p>
<p id="line_4518">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, how’re things looking ahead?”</p>
<p id="line_4519">If this floor was truly built like a maze, we may have to ponder which road to choose every time we encountered a split. Moreover, there may be traps.</p>
<p id="line_4520">“If there were to be any traps, we’d be able to sense them, so is it okay to allow us to continue leading the team?”</p>
<p id="line_4521">“Are you guys truly able to handle it?”</p>
<p id="line_4522">“Just count on me! With my presence, there’s nothing to worry about!”</p>
<p id="line_4523">The person who nodded heavily was Milim, not me.</p>
<p id="line_4524">If no one objects, then we should do just that.</p>
<p id="line_4525">With us leading the charge, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and her vice-captain followed. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were walking at the back of the team to protect the other teammates. Ranga was hidden in my shadow, whereas the chief had stayed behind to stand guard.</p>
<p id="line_4526">I was looking forward to today’s supper.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4527">I used ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ to confirm the status ahead of the road as I casually walked onward. The passages were surrounded by stone walls, which occasionally had murals painted on them. These were some fine drawings.</p>
<p id="line_4528">“They are so beautiful. These murals on their own are already valuable art pieces.”</p>
<p id="line_4529">“Is that so?”</p>
<p id="line_4530">“Indeed. Looks like they are depictions of the living conditions in ancient times. We may be able to gain some understanding of ancient civilization. This alone makes it priceless.”</p>
<p id="line_4531">“Oh—now that you’ve put it that way, it does remind me of the sceneries I’ve seen in the past.”</p>
<p id="line_4532"><em>Ah yes, this by-gone past to me were nostalgic memories for Milim. She must have many feelings passing through here.</em></p>
<p id="line_4533">I should try to keep them in their original conditions and be cautious during our investigation.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4534">The traps that I was worried about did not trigger. The exploration went smoothly.</p>
<p id="line_4535">It was already noon and we decided to rest for a moment.</p>
<p id="line_4536">“Now then, let’s prepare lunch.”</p>
<p id="line_4537">“Ah, hold up. I asked the chief to prepare bento for us, let’s eat that.”</p>
<p id="line_4538">I stopped the teammates who were about to start a fire and took out bento for everyone. It looked as if they appeared out of thin air, but I’d actually stored them all in my ‘Stomach.’ It even kept them warm, what a great Skill for travelling.</p>
<p id="line_4539">“W-well…”</p>
<p id="line_4540">“You can do that?”</p>
<p id="line_4541">Mutters such as these began to spread around, but I ignored all that.</p>
<p id="line_4542">While still feeling confused, the teammates took the bento.</p>
<p id="line_4543">“Umm, this does look very tasty,” Milim said happily after opening up the bento.</p>
<p id="line_4544">It was lunch time.</p>
<p id="line_4545">Scrumptious sandwiches with fresh vegetables, eggs and bacon, that was today’s lunch.</p>
<p id="line_4546">Speaking of the dark elves’ cuisine, their unique sauce was incredible. It tasted like mayonnaise and could even turn crumbly bread soft. And for people who still thought the bread was too tough, they could drink the warm vegetable soup from a large wooden bowl. The stock seemed to have been finely drawn from chicken bones, and it had a rich, savory taste. The vegetables had also thoroughly absorbed the fragrant aroma, and drinking it felt delightfully satisfying.</p>
<p id="line_4547">“No need to hold back, there’s more soup for everyone!”</p>
<p id="line_4548">As I finished, some teammates rushed over with their bowls. Milim came in first though, and looked like she really enjoyed the soup.</p>
<p id="line_4549">“It’s quite rare to have such delicious delicacies in the wilderness. Everyone must be very pleased about it,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san said, but she sounded kind of salty.</p>
<p id="line_4550">She was probably implying that I shouldn’t get too ahead of myself like this. <em>I totally get her meaning, but please forgive my little trick this time.</em></p>
<p id="line_4551">“I actually didn’t want you guys to start a fire here.”</p>
<p id="line_4552">“Fire you say?”</p>
<p id="line_4553">“Yes. I didn’t want there to accidentally be any fire hazard. Moreover, this is underground. Even though there is air flowing, I just want to be cautious.”</p>
<p id="line_4554">“I see that you have foreseen far ahead…”</p>
<p id="line_4555">“I wouldn’t mind if we are outdoors.”</p>
<p id="line_4556">I was genuine. In truth, this passage was narrow and had no water source. If anything were to happen, we probably would have nowhere to run. That’s why I had someone prepare bento.</p>
<p id="line_4557">Also, people would probably need to visit the toilet.</p>
<p id="line_4558">“Ah, I had suspected people would probably want to use the toilet. So, I’m going to open a ‘Portal’ that connects to the entrance. Everyone, please use the lunch break period to relieve yourself.”</p>
<p id="line_4559">I quickly opened the ‘Portal’ after saying so.</p>
<p id="line_4560">I received a round of baffled stares shouting, “This is insane.” But I couldn’t just compromise because of that.</p>
<p id="line_4561">Seriously, I was sure they were planning to sneak off in the darker parts of the passageways and get their business done, but I didn’t wish them to do so. After all, this was the road leading to a tomb, such sacrilege would just be too much.</p>
<p id="line_4562">“Maybe I’m overthinking it, perhaps the deceased won’t mind it after all.”</p>
<p id="line_4563">“…No, your way of thinking is admirable,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san agreed, which I was pleased to hear as well.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4564">Right, as everyone went to take a toilet break—</p>
<p id="line_4565">“I want to try something, is it okay?”</p>
<p id="line_4566">“Try what? Please do tell.”</p>
<p id="line_4567">“Nothing significant, but we are actually running a labyrinth, and right now the most popular strategy has been ‘Spirit Communication.’ It’s a spell that only a shaman or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="spirit wielder" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> can use, it allows you to find your desired path right away.”</p>
<p id="line_4568">“I-is there really magic that convenient?”</p>
<p id="line_4569">Oh, so even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san didn’t know. Actually, it was probably normal that she didn’t know anything outside her own specialty.</p>
<p id="line_4570">“U-uh, well! I am a shaman! Can you tell me in detail about this ‘Spirit Communication’?”</p>
<p id="line_4571">Oh, wonderful timing.</p>
<p id="line_4572">I was going to say that it wouldn’t seem appropriate if I did it myself, this was perfect. A female teammate volunteered herself, saying that she could use ‘Spirit Magic.’ I then explained ‘Spirit Communication’ to her.</p>
<p id="line_4573">“Ah, I see. I understand now!”</p>
<p id="line_4574">She was skilled in the attribute of ‘Wind,’ and her communication with the spirit was very successful.</p>
<p id="line_4575">“Woah, now we won’t get lost! If we were to continue, we will meet a dead end, we should go back to the crossroads three blocks behind them on the way back and take a turn to the east. But it’s gonna be a huge project to construct the map…”</p>
<p id="line_4576">That’s true. The caster would be exhausted after hearing the voice of the spirit for a prolonged period of time, so it was better to draft a map.</p>
<p id="line_4577">In my case, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei would handle all that for me. It could print out the map and draft it almost as if it were using high-precision rendering software.</p>
<p id="line_4578"><em>Eh, hold on?</em></p>
<p id="line_4579">“If that’s the case, I recall a magic that can print out the image in your brain onto paper.”</p>
<p id="line_4580">That’s right, there was magic like that. There was a spell book in the library called “Mischief Magic Illustrated,” a rather silly name.</p>
<p id="line_4581">«Report. Search complete—it is illusion magic ‘Sketch Thought.’»</p>
<p id="line_4582"><em>That’s it!</em></p>
<p id="line_4583">I didn’t remember proper spells, but for some reason, I could memorize this type of spell instantly. A slime’s cells are very great, and its memory is a lot better. It’s almost the same as when I was human.</p>
<p id="line_4584">“Can anyone use ‘Illusion Magic’?”</p>
<p id="line_4585">“A-although I’m still an apprentice, I <em>am</em> a sorcerer!”</p>
<p id="line_4586">“Then can you try to learn this spell, also—”</p>
<p id="line_4587">Regarding the means of sharing information, making use of ‘Telepathy Net’ made things a lot easier. But for something that any average human could use, perhaps a spell would be more convenient. And it was then that—</p>
<p id="line_4588">«Proposal. The most suitable alternative would be illusion magic ‘Share Thought.’»</p>
<p id="line_4589"><em>Oh oh, so you can do that.</em></p>
<p id="line_4590">I taught ‘Sketch Thought’ and ‘Share Thought’ to the young man who claimed himself to be a sorcerer. He put them to work and found that map making became incredibly simple.</p>
<p id="line_4591">“Woah, now we won’t get lost!”</p>
<p id="line_4592">“Perhaps we can even easily sketch the structure of the ruins using this magic!”</p>
<p id="line_4593">“Investigations from now on will be so much easier!”</p>
<p id="line_4594">Well, it’s great that my proposals were appreciated so much.</p>
<p id="line_4595">“We still won’t be able to detect traps or magic mechanisms with the map! So don’t get careless!”</p>
<p id="line_4596">While the teammates were cheering, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san scolded them and quieted them down.</p>
<p id="line_4597"><em>She sure is something else.</em></p>
<p id="line_4598">Without the need of my reminder, she didn’t overlook the remaining risk.</p>
<p id="line_4599">We headed down for the gate leading to the lowest level that day.</p>
<p id="line_4600">And we reached our destination before dark.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4601">Day three.</p>
<p id="line_4602">Today we started from the gate leading to the bottom floor.</p>
<p id="line_4603">We split up, with one group of people trying to decode the magic cast on the gate, and another group exploring the middle floor. I demonstrated how to do it yesterday, and today I would only be observing. Milim, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Ranga would join the exploration team.</p>
<p id="line_4604">“There’s nothing to do, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.”</p>
<p id="line_4605">“How about making some tea for the people working.”</p>
<p id="line_4606">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_4607">Just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, there really was nothing to do. However, I sometimes got questions from the team, so I felt satisfied in a way.</p>
<p id="line_4608"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> excitedly prepared the table and put down all the cups before pouring coffee into them from a magic flask.</p>
<p id="line_4609">I had many feelings witnessing this scene.</p>
<p id="line_4610">Not too long ago, I wouldn’t permit <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to prepare any food.</p>
<p id="line_4611">“Here it is! Does anyone want to have a drink?”</p>
<p id="line_4612"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words set us into a short break.</p>
<p id="line_4613">Hot coffee was quite popular, we spent a short and peaceful time together. Despite how casual I looked, I was still on guard against any ambushes. Although there wasn’t any sign of that just yet.</p>
<p id="line_4614">I hope this is just me overthinking things.</p>
<p id="line_4615">However, now that I was no longer with Veldora, this would be the perfect opportunity for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and her conspirators to strike. I should remain vigilant and observe quietly.</p>
<p id="line_4616">I didn’t forget to keep an extra eye on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and her team. I checked with my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and didn’t detect any suspicious individuals. Their abilities were just as they were told, they weren’t corrupted by ‘Desire’ either, therefore there was no sign of them being manipulated.</p>
<p id="line_4617">If one of these people were indeed brainwashed, then my eyes—or rather, the eyes of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—must have been deceived.</p>
<p id="line_4618">But that’s highly unlikely to have happened.</p>
<p id="line_4619">However, it would be different if they were obeying willingly rather than having been brainwashed. There was that possibility as well, so I couldn’t be careless. Although I didn’t think they would pose much threat with their abilities.</p>
<p id="line_4620">Based on these considerations, I sipped on my coffee nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4621">After some time, Milim came back with a bunch of stuff in hand.</p>
<p id="line_4622">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, check this out! I’ve got so many trophies!”</p>
<p id="line_4623">To be more accurate, her hands were empty as she sat on Ranga. A couple members of the team as well as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were forced to hold onto all sorts of items.</p>
<p id="line_4624">“See, all of these have a bunch of magicule. These alone should make us bank, right?”</p>
<p id="line_4625">Milim was right, most of her trophies were gear. This was already elite gear crafted by master smiths when they were first made. With the times they have endured, their magisteel has completely matured, making their quality skyrocket.</p>
<p id="line_4626">“Oh oh, it’s true. Even though they won’t be worth much as artwork, there are still many impressive weapons here.”</p>
<p id="line_4627">“Right? Check this out, this one is unique-grade!”</p>
<p id="line_4628">This stuff was for real. We couldn’t just leave them lying around, these were highly valuable.</p>
<p id="line_4629">“Where did you find all these?” I asked Milim, as I was a bit confused. “There’s no way Clayman would just leave this stuff laying around…”</p>
<p id="line_4630">“Actually, I accidentally triggered some traps and a bunch of golems came out. These guys had this gear on ‘em.”</p>
<p id="line_4631"><em>Hold up, now I can’t just ignore what she said.</em></p>
<p id="line_4632">“You triggered a trap?”</p>
<p id="line_4633">“UH! N-not like that! It was triggered as soon as I entered the hallway, even you wouldn’t be able to evade that!”</p>
<p id="line_4634">“Right! We were using magic to investigate every hallway for traps. We definitely weren’t being careless!”</p>
<p id="line_4635">According to Milim and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s accounts, they did not slip up. The other teammates testified for them as well, so it was the truth. It looked like the location had stored some sort of response patterns of specific types of creatures. The trap would be triggered when anyone outside of the registered patterns entered. In that way, unless the visitors knew the wavelengths needed to pass beforehand, there was no way anyone could have decoded that. You could only fight your way through.</p>
<p id="line_4636">“Then that can’t be helped. By the way, I didn’t know there were such complex traps.”</p>
<p id="line_4637">“Umm, that taught us a great lesson. We should set traps like these in our labyrinth as well.”</p>
<p id="line_4638">So only the registered individuals could pass through the hallway.</p>
<p id="line_4639">Perhaps this entire floor was used to battle against invaders of the tomb.</p>
<p id="line_4640">“In other words, it is reasonable to deduce that there are many other golems wearing unique-grade gear. I never expected that when left alone for so long, the weapons would be able to evolve, how surprising…”</p>
<p id="line_4641"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was right.</p>
<p id="line_4642">Luckily, Milim and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed them, or the teammates might have been killed by the golems.</p>
<p id="line_4643">“Nothing happened yesterday, so I was rather reassured. But there may be other traps on this floor. However, don’t panic just yet, from tomorrow onward, we need to be much more cautious in doing our work.”</p>
<p id="line_4644">“You have a point. Analyzing this door seems to need more time, tomorrow—“ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was abruptly cut off as the earth suddenly began to shake. Including the ruins, the area suddenly experienced a huge energy reaction. Bits of stone were falling from the ceiling, which only added to the feeling of oppression and fear.</p>
<p id="line_4645">“What is happening—?!”</p>
<p id="line_4646">“Let’s get out now, this place is gonna collapse!”</p>
<p id="line_4647">The teammates began to panic before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san scolded them loudly and told them to calm down.</p>
<p id="line_4648">“Quiet! The duration of the vibration was short, it was not an earthquake. A solid structure like this wouldn’t collapse so easily. Let’s all stay calm and find a place for shelter.”</p>
<p id="line_4649">Her shout calmed them down. These teammates were pretty mature.</p>
<p id="line_4650">“What was that just now?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked me in a calm voice.</p>
<p id="line_4651">“Uh—the shock wave seemed to come from the surface, and it was quite strong. The castle may have been affected as well…”</p>
<p id="line_4652">If anything were to happen, we still have ‘Portals’ to help us, so there’s no need to panic. Upon thinking so, I gave my answer to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4653">But, with that being said…</p>
<p id="line_4654"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san hit the nail on the head, it was not an earthquake. It was a local energy reaction, it must’ve been man-made. I was also concerned about the situation on the surface, to the point that I was considering whether I should take a look outside.</p>
<p id="line_4655">It was then that I had a certain intuition.</p>
<p id="line_4656">«Report. Hostile intent detected. The defense mechanisms within the ruins seemed to have been activated. It has been confirmed that multiple golems were on the move. In addition, someone was invading the ruins.»</p>
<p id="line_4657">The alarm bells were set off.</p>
<p id="line_4658">Some sort of mechanical voice suddenly began to blare.</p>
<p id="line_4659">“AMALITA HAS BEEN INFILTRATED. EXTERMINATE INVADERS! AMALITA HAS BEEN INFILTRATED, EXTERMINATE INVADERS!”</p>
<p id="line_4660">The repetition of the voice gave me nothing but a premonition of danger. The situation just went downhill real fast.</p>
<p id="line_4661">The surface also wouldn’t be safe, and the insides of the ruins were also in a state of emergency.</p>
<p id="line_4662">“How can this be! The entire ruins—all of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Amalita" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s defense mechanisms have been activated on their own?”</p>
<p id="line_4663">Now even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was panicking, her calm demeanor just now disappeared.</p>
<p id="line_4664">“There seemed to be invaders. They must have triggered the traps. But, even if we stress that we weren’t the ones who triggered them, the golems won’t understand.”</p>
<p id="line_4665">I answered this way, yet I was starting to suspect <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. She was standing close to the door, could she have triggered the defensive mechanisms without my seeing?</p>
<p id="line_4666">Moreover, the timing seemed too good to be true. As soon as the invaders came, the alarm went off. This seemed calculated no matter how you see it.</p>
<p id="line_4667">“Milim, is there a problem?”</p>
<p id="line_4668">“No, I haven’t picked up anything yet.”</p>
<p id="line_4669">Secret conversations using ‘Telepathy Net’ or ‘Magic Communication’ would be picked up by Milim. So there was no use hiding it, yet there didn’t seem to be any reaction this time.</p>
<p id="line_4670">I was suspecting that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was working with the invaders, looked like I was overthinking things.</p>
<p id="line_4671"><em>Then, is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san innocent?</em></p>
<p id="line_4672">«Answer. Cannot be determined. If ‘Soul Corridor’ is connected, they can utilize secret channels of ‘Telepathy Net.’»</p>
<p id="line_4673"><em>I see, so I still can’t put my guard down.</em></p>
<p id="line_4674">I didn’t want to start fighting my enemies while in the company of a suspected spy… It’d be pretty convenient if they would abandon and leave us alone, but that wouldn’t be right.</p>
<p id="line_4675">“This is not looking good. The invaders were probably the same organization that got their eyes on us.”</p>
<p id="line_4676">“Ah ah, can’t believe they are real…”</p>
<p id="line_4677">“That earthquake must have been them—!”</p>
<p id="line_4678">“But they decided to target a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, just how stupid can they be?”</p>
<p id="line_4679">Their reactions seemed genuine. There weren’t any suspicious teammates. <em>If that’s the case, I think I kinda get the picture now. Let’s protect everyone here and defeat the enemies.</em></p>
<p id="line_4680">“Rest assured, I promise that I will protect every one of you guys.”</p>
<p id="line_4681">This surprised a couple of teammates. They probably thought that I would leave them to their death. I’d be hurt that way. We only just managed to become close, I hoped they would put more trust in me.</p>
<p id="line_4682">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, is it just like what you expected?”</p>
<p id="line_4683">“Yes. Whether it is them taking the bait, or me, let’s find out.”</p>

But how did they manage to get in—<em>I guess I’m not gonna ask about that.</em></p>
<p id="line_4685">If they were hand-picked elites, it was probably a piece of cake sneaking past the dark elves on the surface and inside the castle and then getting into the ruins.</p>
<p id="line_4686">This time, let’s decide who’s the victor here.</p>
<p id="line_4687">I expected this to happen a long time ago. I had planned out the strategies in response, so there was no need to panic. We would be facing our enemies as planned.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4688">The second shockwave hit.</p>
<p id="line_4689">“What is going on? I have a bad feeling about this.”</p>

<p id="line_4693">It was difficult doing this from inside the ruins, but I managed to use my magicule to have ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Magic Perception" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ expand to the outer region. It was then that I saw this vicious dragon.</p>
<p id="line_4694">It looked a lot like Veldora, but its size was a lot bigger. Its skin had rotted and its enormous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was leaking out.</p>
<p id="line_4695">It looked like it possessed a great amount of magicule. It may even far exceed that of an awakened <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, its danger level must have reached Catastrophe class.</p>
<p id="line_4696">“I-is that bad?”</p>
<p id="line_4697">“Yes, looks like it’s a dragon. But not just any greater dragon—it’s probably stronger than a dragon lord. Could that be Veldora’s brother…?”</p>
<p id="line_4698">“Y-you mean, Veldora-sama?”</p>
<p id="line_4699">It has already exceeded the size of a regular wyvern and could only be explained to be a True Dragon. However, it didn’t look like Veldora either. It had no sense of majesty or grace…</p>
<p id="line_4700">Actually, that idiot dragon had no grace or majesty, either. That’s not the point. I suppose the right thing to say is that they seemed different. They were similar but different at the same time.</p>
<p id="line_4701">“That’s—!” Milim suddenly went wide eyed.</p>
<p id="line_4702">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’ve got something urgent to do. Th-that dragon is—”</p>
<p id="line_4703">As she finished, Milim stared at the sky and left with ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Spatial Movement" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.’</p>
<p id="line_4704">Seeing how panicked she looked, I could sort of guess what had happened. The fact that she panicked meant things were dire. In other words, our enemy had brought out something incredible.</p>
<p id="line_4705">“Unbelievable, that seemed to be Milim’s friend, the dragon she sealed in the past. It wasn’t revived, but it seemed like someone had broken the seal and attempted to control it.”</p>
<p id="line_4706">“What! Is this true, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama?”</p>
<p id="line_4707">“Umm. I felt an incredibly strong shockwave. I don’t think even I have a chance of winning this.”</p>
<p id="line_4708">This was a fact. Not even Charybdis, who was born from the dregs of Veldora’s power, could compare to this. I was sensing a fearsome aura of hatred and spite. It probably wouldn’t stop until it destroyed the whole world.</p>
<p id="line_4709">Moreover, this emotion was under someone else’s control. In other words, this dragon’s emotion was being manipulated by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and it was her puppet.</p>
<p id="line_4710">“—Chaos Dragon, I never expected to see this tyrant in this day and age…”</p>
<p id="line_4711">Hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s mutter, I felt the same.</p>
<p id="line_4712">Thankfully, Milim was here. She should be able to defeat it and put the Chaos Dragon back to sleep. There was no need for me to worry here. I needed to handle what’s coming for me instead.</p>

<p id="line_4714">“Understood!”</p>
<p id="line_4715">“Just leave it to me, these third-rate golems won’t stand a chance against me!”</p>
<p id="line_4716">I was planning to use a ‘Portal’ to let the teammates flee to the outside, but it looked like I wouldn’t have the time. We were huddled near the gate, and platoons of golems were marching towards us.</p>

<p id="line_4718">The sad thing was, the ceiling was too low, and it got stuck.</p>
<p id="line_4719">“Idiot! You gotta check your surroundings carefully before engaging!”</p>
<p id="line_4720">“S-sorry! That was a slight miscalculation.”</p>
<p id="line_4721">This slight miscalculation could have cost someone’s life.</p>

She must have slipped up because of her recklessness, hopefully she would be more careful next time.</p>
<p id="line_4723">“It’s gonna be difficult to fight in tight spaces like this. But we don’t know what’s ahead of us, perhaps the bottom floor will be quite spacious.”</p>
<p id="line_4724">“Then I’ll have someone undo the seal fast—”</p>
<p id="line_4725">“No, at this point, let me handle it.”</p>
<p id="line_4726"><em>Sorry, I’ve got no time for this.</em></p>
<p id="line_4727">“Ranga, go and help those two.”</p>
<p id="line_4728"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Ranga—those three would buy some time while I tried to finish the work at hand.</p>
<p id="line_4729">The alarm was raised, and the traps were activated. Based on the hope of preserving the ruins, I didn’t want to be reckless. Yet in the end, I didn’t have to worry too much about the door as it opened up almost instantly.</p>
<p id="line_4730">“Come on, let’s get inside!”</p>
<p id="line_4731">The teammates followed my lead and quickly ran down the stairs. No one was in a panic and their evacuation was smooth. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was the last in line. I protected her from the back and went down the stairs as well.</p>
<p id="line_4732">And so, everyone made it to the bottom floor.</p>
<p id="line_4733">The floor where the dead slumbered.</p>
<p id="line_4734">It did not quite look like a tomb, as a bright light filled the place. It was a large and spacious meadow. This serene scenery almost made me forget about our situation upon reaching it. I couldn’t help but be mesmerized.</p>
<p id="line_4735">But this was not the time to be amazed.</p>
<p id="line_4736">The next second, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> fell down the stairs. We began to battle against the golems that were coming after him.</p>
<p id="line_4737">However, the tables turned quickly. Now that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could move freely, she began to smash all the golems into pieces.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4738">At this point, there wasn’t gonna be any mercy for anyone. If the opportunity presents itself, then we must crush our enemies. Surely, our opponents shared the same sentiment.</p>
<p id="line_4739">Provoking Milim—they were willing to take on such a risk in order to isolate me. I didn’t expect them to go to this length. Honestly, I might have underestimated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4740"><em>However, it’s not gonna happen again from now on.</em></p>
<p id="line_4741">«—Roger that. Converting to full battle mode.»</p>
<p id="line_4742">I calmly prepared myself. Removing all limits that I had layered onto myself, I prepared for the enemies coming our way.</p>
<p id="line_4743">Now we just had to wait for the mastermind to arrive.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4744">There were hordes of golems, but the situation was looking good for us.</p>
<p id="line_4745"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had completely gone wild while Ranga provided support and disruptions. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the chance to use his gun to destroy the golems and even had plenty of time to reload.</p>
<p id="line_4746">It looked like they were all handling the fights quite well. The other teammates were relieved as well.</p>
<p id="line_4747">“About that, I’m really surprised that someone actually attacked. Who would be so daring as to launch an attack on the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? And they even awakened that Chaos Dragon—“ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san asked me out of curiosity.</p>
<p id="line_4748">She seemed rather panicked and sounded quite worried. It’d be impressive if all of this were just an act, but I honestly had no idea about what was going on in her heart.</p>
<p id="line_4749">“Sorry to have dragged you guys into this matter.”</p>
<p id="line_4750">“There’s no such thing! Now that the Chaos Dragon has been revived, it is rather reassuring to have <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama at our aid.”</p>
<p id="line_4751">“That’s right! We need to report this back to HQ as soon as possible so that they can figure out a solution.”</p>
<p id="line_4752">“But, if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Milim were to be defeated, wouldn’t that leave us with no solution at all…”</p>
<p id="line_4753">“Rather than thinking about that, it’s more important to overcome the trouble brewing right before us! We have no idea who did this, but intentionally triggering the traps is terribly wicked.”</p>
<p id="line_4754">Some people brought up optimistic views, it seemed that they had adjusted their mood quite fast.</p>
<p id="line_4755">“Didn’t I just say that I’ll protect you all? That being said, I have to win first.”</p>
<p id="line_4756">To reassure the teammates, I intentionally joked about the situation.</p>
<p id="line_4757">We had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Ranga and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> here.

<p id="line_4758">Our situation may not exactly look bright, but it was definitely not the worst. We were gonna defeat all of our enemies and clear the burdens at hand. Then we would have to worry about what came next. It was fairly simple.</p>
<p id="line_4759"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san probably was reassured as well after hearing my words, she hadn’t spoken much since.</p>
<p id="line_4760">I turned to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others who were fighting while waiting for the people that were to arrive.</p>
<p id="line_4761">“—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama sure has a lot of enemies.

<p id="line_4762">I happened to be available while waiting for my enemies, so I answered casually, “I suppose so, not that I wanted any of them.”</p>
<p id="line_4763">“Why?”</p>
<p id="line_4764">“The Kingdom of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pissed me off. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Clayman played dirty and forced me to defend myself. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the Saint had problems with me because of a misunderstanding. It’s always been someone else trying to pick a fight with me, that’s why I was willing to confront them. In a sense, they were justified self-defense.”</p>
<p id="line_4765">“I see. Then, has <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama never actively set up a scheme?”</p>
<p id="line_4766">“Not exactly true. There was a conflict of interest between my opponents and me this time, after all. Our beliefs clashed, and it became a competition of who would strike first. That’s how things have developed to this point.”</p>
<p id="line_4767">“Can you resolve the conflict without violence—?”</p>
<p id="line_4768">“Perhaps. But, if the only way to win in this fight is to absorb your opponent, under the circumstances that my opponent doesn’t exactly want to be absorbed by me, I suppose this is the right call.”</p>
<p id="line_4769">Dwargon and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—Tempest had forged an alliance with these two megastates, there was no reason why we would lose in an economic battle with the Western Nations.</p>

<p id="line_4771">“—Eh? In other words, you thought that what your enemies were doing was the correct thing?”</p>
<p id="line_4772"><em>Hmmm, I’m not so sure about that.</em></p>
<p id="line_4773">If we were to recognize the difference in our ideology and both take a step back, things may have worked if the both of us steered clear from each other’s business.</p>
<p id="line_4774">Our enemy had justifications, but so did I. I wanted to have control over my opponent, yet they did not wish to be controlled, so confrontation was the only solution. In some sense, economic warfare was far more horrifying than war fought with men. There was no concept of surrender. It wouldn’t stop until one of the players was absorbed.</p>
<p id="line_4775">That’s why I was lucky that they decided to use violence to confront me. In this way, they would admit defeat once they realized they had no chance of winning. Even though that was the only method left for our opponents, whether they were justified in doing so was another issue entirely.</p>
<p id="line_4776">“We have different stances, and so-called justice also has infinite forms. I can’t say that I am definitely the one in the right, but to quit here means that we will be at a disadvantage. That’s why all we can do is to fight our enemies with everything we have…”</p>
<p id="line_4777">Of course, we could also yield and beg for mercy.</p>
<p id="line_4778">Though, if I admitted defeat, all my companions would suffer.</p>
<p id="line_4779">“But you can still respect their perspective, exchange opinions and try to establish good relationships. Wouldn’t there be no need to be hostile against each other then?”</p>
<p id="line_4780">That was a difficult question to answer.</p>
<p id="line_4781">How should I put it—but before I could concern myself with the question, a young girl spoke up and answered it for me.</p>
<p id="line_4782">“No way, that wouldn’t work. Man’s desire is limitless and will not simply endure. Once your opponent decides to step back, you would obviously make more demands. That’s simply human nature.”</p>
<p id="line_4783">Yes. If we were to take a step back, our opponent would be understanding as well—I wish that were true, but that wasn’t realistic in the slightest. If I were just a mere citizen of the world, perhaps I could look forward to a dream like that, perhaps I could’ve praised such idealism.</p>
<p id="line_4784">But—as the ruler, there was no way I could believe such a fairy tale.</p>
<p id="line_4785">It seemed that the head of our enemies thought the same as me.</p>
<p id="line_4786">“We seem to understand each other. I thought so too.

<p class="space-break" id="line_4788">Almost in an instant, all of the golems were destroyed.</p>
<p id="line_4789">In front of me was the young girl that I had seen before during the nation founding festival. As I suspected, she was the enemy. And she was a lot bolder than I expected. I thought she would be more cunning and would stay off the frontline. It was rather amazing to see her leading the charge at the scene.</p>
<p id="line_4790">She wasn’t alone, however. There were three more people around her.</p>
<p id="line_4791">Gai, with wounds all over his body, and another man in a knight uniform.</p>

<p id="line_5159">Right now, I was gazing at the Chaos Dragon.</p>
<p id="line_5160">It was huge, to the point of excessive. By my estimate it was about one hundred meters long. Its gigantic body could even outmatch Charybdis. It was a shocking sight. It also looked like it was consuming the magicule in its surroundings and gradually gaining in size.</p>
<p id="line_5161">It could decimate a mountain with a single breath. It was some tyrant, indeed.</p>
<p id="line_5162">With a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> such as this as our opponent, even we would have to surrender.</p>
<p id="line_5163">However, Milim was different. She used her ultra-large pool of magicule to restrain the Chaos Dragon and prevent it from attacking.</p>
<p id="line_5164">“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Milim!”</p>
<p id="line_5165">“There you are, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I’ve been waiting for you! This is really frustrating for me, because this here is my friend. I was trying to seal him but couldn’t do it. If this were to continue it will result in casualties… But I also can’t kill my friend!” Milim shouted, sounding upset.</p>
<p id="line_5166">Unlike Charybdis, the Chaos Dragon was one of Milim’s valued friends. It was only natural that she didn’t want to kill it… Moreover, the Dragon was too large. Even with Milim’s power, sealing it had proven difficult.</p>
<p id="line_5167">It was easy to achieve victory, but Milim couldn’t bring herself to kill her friend.</p>
<p id="line_5168">I could understand her feelings. I like this Milim.</p>
<p id="line_5169">Which was why I gave her a big smile and told her to rest assured.</p>
<p id="line_5170">“It’s all right, I’ve got a plan!”</p>
<p id="line_5171">“How reliable! What should I do then?”</p>
<p id="line_5172">Milim faced me with shining eyes. She trusted me a lot, even under a lot of stress.</p>
<p id="line_5173"><em>Don’t panic, me.</em></p>
<p id="line_5174">I continued to put on a confident air and explained my plan to Milim.</p>
<p id="line_5175">“Listen to me now, no matter how large a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is, it must have a ‘Core.’ Why don’t you use your precision attacks to knock out the rest of its body until only the core is left?”</p>
<p id="line_5176">It was just like when we tried to save <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Phobio" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who was possessed by Charybdis. Milim should be able to avoid attacking the Chaos Dragon’s soul.</p>
<p id="line_5177">The astral body and spiritual body that were responsible for protecting the Chaos Dragon’s soul had been completely corrupted. Actually, it was the opposite case. It was because of the damage both bodies had suffered that led to it being corrupted by hatred to this extent.</p>
<p id="line_5178">On top of that, with the corruption of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Greed" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ it was incurable.</p>
<p id="line_5179">But perhaps, it was possible to preserve its soul alone.</p>
<p id="line_5180">It used to be Milim’s friend, and it could be seen, even if it was just a tiny bit, that its core was fighting hard so that it wouldn’t diminish the remaining light in it.</p>
<p id="line_5181">“B-but…it has become so powerful; I probably won’t be able to penetrate it without applying enough strength. I may accidentally destroy it completely…”</p>
<p id="line_5182">“Didn’t you learn how to control your strength before? Your friend is trying very hard, so you should show the same courage as well!”</p>
<p id="line_5183">I wasn’t going to let her find any excuses now.</p>
<p id="line_5184">The most important thing here was courage. If we fail—if we were to have such a notion in mind—what could have been a success, would fail anyway.</p>
<p id="line_5185">“I will assist you. Just follow my instructions and concentrate on unleashing the full force of your magic!”</p>
<p id="line_5186">I was playing cool when I said that I had a plan, but there actually wasn’t any. It would all hinge on Milim just toughing it out.</p>
<p id="line_5187">But this was not her first try. I had witnessed her doing it once before and it was very successful. The scale this time was different, but it’s the same thing.</p>
<p id="line_5188">“Okay. I have faith in you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_5189">“Right, just count on me!” I acted all confident.</p>
<p id="line_5190">This would have a huge impact on everyone’s mood. The thought of failure alone was extremely scary. But there was no other way. Only I could do this.</p>
<p id="line_5191"><em>I’ll be counting on you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!</em></p>

<p id="line_5193">I always pushed my responsibilities to other people and was pretty powerless in this situation. Now I really gotta put on an act.</p>
<p id="line_5194"><em>Don’t be afraid of failure. Everything will be fine.</em> I tried to convince myself.</p>
<p id="line_5195">“It’s all right, last time you were successful almost immediately. This time will be the same! Let’s go Milim!”</p>
<p id="line_5196">“Yeah! You are right, then here I go, my friend. Watch carefully now, behold the brightness of all the stars in the galaxy! Drago Bustaaa!”</p>
<p id="line_5197">A blinding light was shot out. It felt as if my brain would be burnt to ash even if I closed my eyes.</p>
<p id="line_5198">Milim unleashed a gigantic swirl of power and it went straight at the Chaos Dragon.</p>
<p id="line_5199">Its unknown power formed a barrier that impacted Milim’s lightning.</p>
<p id="line_5200">The two powers began to clash.</p>
<p id="line_5201">I analyzed the wave of energy and found the source of the Chaos Dragon’s power. I was doing this simultaneously while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s analysis helped Milim control her power.</p>
<p id="line_5202">It was so heavy. The power was so heavy. I could tell that my magicules were going down. With this much energy input, the Chaos Dragon still didn’t seem to have weakened. What a tough foe. I was almost losing hope, but if we gave up here, everything would go south. All my planning had been for times like these. I believed this deeply and gave it all I had.</p>
<p id="line_5203">On one hand, I tried to calm myself down, and on the other, I slowly tried to get rid of the evil spirit trapping the Chaos Dragon.</p>
<p id="line_5204">The entire process lasted around one second…</p>
<p id="line_5205">However, the heavy, oppressive aura I felt in that one instant seemed to last an eternity.</p>
<p id="line_5206"><em>I see it!</em></p>
<p id="line_5207">The uncontaminated core of the Chaos Dragon. It was still glowing with a dim light.</p>
<p id="line_5208"><em>I can’t just rest yet.</em></p>
<p id="line_5209">There was a black fog formed by ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Greed" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ and an evil spirit of hatred. Even if I extracted all of those, it might still cause some mental corruption later. I had to proceed with extreme caution.</p>
<p id="line_5210">The operation continued.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_5211">All of a sudden, the black fog disappeared. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must have defeated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!</p>
<p id="line_5212">“Okay, now we have a chance!”</p>
<p id="line_5213"><em>I’ll use this to win.</em></p>

<p id="line_5215">“Milim, let’s take this chance to get it done, can you increase your input?”</p>
<p id="line_5216">“Just leave it to me! Raaah, Drago Nova!”</p>
<p id="line_5217">Following my instruction, Milim began to show her true abilities.</p>
<p id="line_5218">This, once again, made me realize just how strong Milim was. How was it possible for her to put in even more power at that point? The fact that she could casually pull off ultimate techniques like these showed that she was on a different level to me.</p>
<p id="line_5219"><em>Ahh, no no. This is no time to get all impressed.</em></p>
<p id="line_5220">“Okay, Chaos Dragon. We will set you free now,” I muttered, beginning the final step.</p>
<p id="line_5221">Timing was key.</p>
<p id="line_5222">The spiritual body of the Chaos Dragon had leaked out, and Milim’s magic had destroyed it, along with its astral body.</p>
<p id="line_5223">I witnessed all that, and before Milim crushed its core, I needed to execute ‘Devour Soul.’</p>
<p id="line_5224">Ignoring time and space, ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gluttonous King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Beelzebuth" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ was activated.</p>
<p id="line_5225">As long as I could see, it would finish the job faster than Milim’s magic.</p>
<p id="line_5226">And, my plan worked. I successfully obtained the Chaos Dragon’s broken core.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_5227">As the ‘core’ that managed its enormous magicule content disappeared, the Chaos Dragon began to collapse.</p>
<p id="line_5228">But that was precisely the issue.</p>

It’s going to explode!”</p>
<p id="line_5230">Seeing my signal, Milim stopped her magic. But there was still a gigantic energy field that was powerful enough to warp space left.</p>
<p id="line_5231">The clashing power’s collisions had created a super dense energy cluster. It would start to destabilize soon. Sooner or later, it’d cause a huge explosion. Even Milim wouldn’t be able to deflect it.</p>
<p id="line_5232">She looked at me anxiously.</p>
<p id="line_5233">But I was not panicking at all.

<p id="line_5264">“It’s called Gaia! I thought of that long ago and was going to name it one day. Its ‘name’ is Gaia!”</p>

<p id="line_5268">Finally, the Emulated Soul began to glow lightly.</p>
<p id="line_5269">It succeeded. The soul now had a core. I used a Master Core to cover Gaia’s Emulated Soul. And there, the Avatar Core was completed. And my work here was finally done.</p>

<p id="line_5271">“It worked, Milim. This is a brand-new Gaia. It hasn’t been born yet, it’s like an egg.”</p>

<p id="line_5278">Yeah yeah.</p>
<p id="line_5279">That being said, thank god Milim was here.</p>
<p id="line_5280">This was not something I could have handled.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_5281">The castle emerged on the horizon. I could see all my companions. They were all waiting eagerly, and I was glad that everyone was all right.</p>
<p id="line_5282">Now the issue had been resolved.</p>
<p id="line_5283">I really wanted to go back and relax a bit.</p>
<p id="line_5284">Take a shower and have a cup of beer.</p>

<p id="line_5303">The truth was that he detonated a pre-placed magic bomb, but he twisted the narrative by saying: “The explosion was smaller because the residual energy within the engine reactor was relatively low.” In order to make himself more believable, he had even scattered scraps of the actual engine reactor.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_5351">We had taken out the Chaos Dragon and saved Milim’s friend.</p>
<p id="line_5352">After going back to check, we discovered that the bottom floor of the ruin was buried. According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who seemed to be in one piece, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> blew herself up upon being forced into desperation. She seemed to have wanted to take me down with her—<em>was she really going that far just to take care of me?</em></p>
<p id="line_5353">Upon thinking so, that kind of made me sad.</p>
<p id="line_5354">But we were enemies, and I couldn’t really help how things turned out…</p>
<p id="line_5355">It was no use for me to constantly fall into this emotional low point. I needed to go talk to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and see if we could restore the ruins. It would take some time, but we planned to dig out the entire bottom floor. We would do it one bit at a time, and display the devices dug out from the ruins. This castle was planned to be decorated into a museum.</p>
<p id="line_5356">We also planned to create more tracks for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="magitrain" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to connect here and make this a tourist site. I wasn’t sure how many years this would take, on top of the many issues I already had on my to-do list. The least that I could be sure of now, however, was that until we signed a nonaggression pact with the Eastern Empire, this would be the foremost frontline of the battlefield. Even though this was part of Milim’s territory, we still couldn’t be careless.</p>
<p id="line_5357">Therefore, we only planned to conduct the restoration work.</p>
<p id="line_5358">The negotiations with the Council were proceeding smoothly as well. After our moderation of the Council members, their authority had reduced greatly. On the other hand, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Western Holy Church" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had flourished, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, no longer under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s control, also grew more influential.</p>
<p id="line_5359">With how things had developed, the Council called for a new unifying force.</p>
<p id="line_5360">And that would be us—or rather, me. Tempest had become the biggest faction within the Council. We had the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> led by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> behind our back.

<p id="line_5361"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also agreed to the matter. She justified that it would be beneficial for peace among the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_5362">And so, I was able to cultivate great influence in the Western Nations.</p>
<p id="line_5363">On another note, I was glad that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could finally be washed off his suspicion.</p>

<p id="line_5365">«Negative. The suspicion is confirmed.

<p id="line_5369">«…»</p>
<p id="line_5370">It’s all because I was too naive.

I should not have hesitated for the sake of the future. If she had tried to inflict harm on me, my doubt would have disappeared. But, since they hadn’t really made too much trouble for us, I felt that it was unnecessary to kill her.</p>
<p id="line_5371">There was also Gai. I also felt that I had gone overboard, after killing him. That was also one of the reasons for me to be discouraged from doing the same to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p id="line_5373">«…Yes. I felt that it was necessary.»</p>
<p id="line_5374"><em>How dare you act on your own—!</em> I couldn’t really say that.</p>
<p id="line_5375">In fact, just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san predicted, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> killed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> without so much as a flinch.

<p id="line_5376">I had no reason to complain. But I also felt frustrated.

<p id="line_5378"><em>Thanks. For helping me avoid the guilt afterward too.</em></p>
<p id="line_5379">While I was happy about this outcome, I couldn’t let this happen in the future. I had to face what was coming and make decisions based on my own will.

<h1 class="afterword" id="afterword">Afterword</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_5387">Long time no see, everyone. This is Fuse.</p>
<p id="line_5388">I was going to forgo writing an afterword this time. The reason being that this volume has been the one with the most added pages in the history of Tensura light novels, even after attempts at cutting things.</p>
<p id="line_5389">The sound of Editor I-san giving up the struggle was really unforgettable.</p>
<p id="line_5390">But! It turned out, in the end, there were a couple pages left. They told me to write an afterword of around five pages.</p>
<p id="line_5391">I mentioned this before, when I go to a bookshop to read light novels, I would first read the blurb before checking the afterword. Sometimes I will even determine whether the work is interesting or not on the merits of the afterword.</p>
<p id="line_5392">Moreover, even if the work is part of a big series, I’ll still read the afterword to first check whether there is any new information, when the next volume will be released, etc. That’s my habit of checking before reading the actual book.</p>
<p id="line_5393">That’s why personally I felt that “the afterword is important,” but when it came to my time to write one, it was a different story…</p>
<p id="line_5394">No, actually, I suppose even if I were to write about the author’s personal life, not a lot of people would be interested. And if I discussed something related to the series, it would become a spoiler. As opposed to writing an afterword, it’s probably better to write more in the main story. That’s probably what a lot of people’s thoughts are right now.</p>
<p id="line_5395">If the readers want to hear about things like this in particular, please contact the GC Novels editorial department!</p>
<p id="line_5396">It will probably be reflected in the book.</p>
<p id="line_5397">Now, let’s have a little chat about this time’s volume.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Soft scene break." class="ornament-soft" src="/ln/sources/Volume 10/figures/softscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_5398">Regarding the pistol that was introduced in this volume, there’s an untold story behind it.</p>
<p id="line_5399">This is the first time I used Arabic numerals. That was the pistol name that actually exists in real life, “Walther P99.” We were going to use kanji for the numbers, but it seems that weapons from the real world are an exception to that.</p>
<p id="line_5400">The weapon that Glenda used in the novel was a semi-automatic pistol developed by the German weapon manufacturer Walther. And of course, it is real.</p>
<p id="line_5401">At first, I was considering whether I should use a pistol produced by Beretta, such as the M92 or PX4, but if I did, it may get mixed up with the character Beretta. That’s why I got pretty frustrated trying to decide which gun to choose, before finally settling on the P99.</p>
<p id="line_5402">Speaking of Walther, their P38 is quite famous. The highly popular master thief (Lupin III)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Lupin the Third is a Japanese manga series." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> also uses this weapon, so it’s very well known. I initially wanted to get some of his clout but decided not to in the end.</p>
<p id="line_5403">Glenda-san is a female, so a smaller and more compact weapon is probably more suited for her. Based on this consideration, I settled on the gun that was introduced this time, the “Walther P99.”</p>
<p id="line_5404">Its name only appeared once, but in order to write about it, I researched a bunch and even bought an airsoft version of it. It was then that I recalled I wanted one when I was a kid. I suppose this can be considered as me fulfilling a childhood dream, now that I have the money as an adult—uh, but I digress.</p>
<p id="line_5405">That’s the type of gun it was. I plan to make it show up a couple of times in the future as well.</p>
<p id="line_5406">There are mechanical and magic type pistols. While the pistols in question have the same names, the two are very different from each other. For instance, the gun <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> brought to the exploration was only a recreated copy. It only looked similar in appearance. It also seemed to require gunpowder, but I felt that there was too much complication. Can’t we make it a bit simpler? That’s why I gave the final pistol some magic modification.</p>
<p id="line_5407">Furthermore, in the book I hinted at the fact that the Empire had guns as well. So, I plan to write something completely different for them. I only made the magic-modified guns with reference to the way that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others thought.</p>
<p id="line_5408">That’s how I felt. But there are also other problems.</p>
<p id="line_5409">On the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> side, I planned that for the same clan, they will be named after supercars. On the other hand, the series of magic dolls, like Beretta, would be named after gun manufacturers.</p>
<p id="line_5410">In the web novel, Beretta didn’t have any brothers.</p>
<p id="line_5411">So, what should we do?</p>
<p id="line_5412">The reason why we mentioned naming Walther was in hope that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would recall the matter…</p>
<p id="line_5413">Sig, Colt, Glock, Mauser, Mateba, Remington. There are also the twins, Heckler and Koch. There are also tons of other candidates, but these are the only ones that made it in. These people, as Beretta’s peers, will surely shine in Tempest.</p>
<p id="line_5414"><em>Figuring out their backstories alone would be tiring, so please don’t let them be introduced</em>—I could almost hear someone’s cry along this line, so there’s probably no need to introduce them. However, I hope that, in the future, they can be introduced in side stories and other Tensura IP.</p>
<p id="line_5415">And these are the untold stories about guns.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_5416">Here at the end of the volume, I want to express my gratitude to everyone that I’ve accumulated from my daily life.</p>
<p id="line_5417">First of all, I want to thank Editor I-san who was always helpful with providing information to me. With the increase in pages, I apologize for the extra work. But since you said that it was good for the readers, as the author, I was therefore relieved. My mood really improves whenever I’m talking to you over the phone, so I’ll be counting on you in the future as well!</p>
<p id="line_5418">There’s also Mitz Vah-sensei who has provided the series with beautiful illustrations every time. Thank you for your hard work on designing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Mariabell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Thanks to you, the character was created excellently. As I am writing this afterword, you must be working hard on Volume 10’s cover and illustration.</p>
<p id="line_5419">Even as the author, I am also looking forward to it!</p>
<p id="line_5420">The series only got to be published with the support of the proofreaders, designers, and other people.</p>
<p id="line_5421">Thank you all so much!</p>
<p id="line_5422">I would also like to thank all the readers. “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” managed to make it through the tenth volume at last. Thanks to all the readers for following the series to this day. To repay everyone’s support, I will work harder in the future with the goal of concluding the series one day.</p>
