The traffic on the streets had gradually settled down and the residents were no longer that busy. And so, we began to open and run the moderated dungeon. Quite a few adventurers seemed eager to explore the dungeon and a great number of them had inquired about it. And, as if in response to their expectations, we finally opened up the labyrinth. We had already made sufficient preparations and waited until just the right moment to open.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_242"><span class="indent"><span>The days gradually became busy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_243"><span class="indent"><span>………</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_244"><span class="indent"><span>……</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_245"><span class="indent"><span>…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_246"><span class="indent"><span>Problems emerged within hours of the debut.

That’s why we took steps to lower the difficulty accordingly. But despite all that, the challengers were still having too much of a hard time.

That said, the previous fall traps that Ramiris set were all removed. So, in order to successfully break through the level, you would still need to sketch maps.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_250"><span class="indent"><span>The way I saw it, no matter how slow you were, a whole day was the longest you would need to complete the level.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_251"><span class="indent"><span>Yet for the past three days, not a single one managed to get to the second floor.

As these comically bad adventurers rushed towards the treasure chests, their backs were inevitably pierced with arrows.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_256"><span class="indent"><span>In other words, they just sucked. Their danger awareness was practically nonexistent. Among the idiots, some were at least smart enough to come in squads.

After confirming everyone’s arrival, I lead the opening statement: “Everyone, it has been three days since the labyrinth went public, but this is not looking good. To be blunt, it actually sucks.

Rather, this is precisely why we should charge a high price for it. Adventurers that don’t have any pressing matters will choose to stay at an inn.

They had evolved beyond Rank A, so those who could take them down were quite limited. If you broke through the fiftieth floor, then you would receive one hundred gold coins.

Moreover, for special-grade, I had been told that it could go as high as fifty times the market price.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_588"><span class="indent"><span>As for rare-grade, it was all up to luck whether they could get it or not. It was rarely produced, and it wasn’t something you necessarily would be able to buy with money.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_589"><span class="indent"><span>Obviously, there would be people who get obsessed with the labyrinth and try to come back for more.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_590"><span class="indent"><span>Basson and his men were already promoting for us at the tavern.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_591"><span class="indent"><span>“Hey hey, check this out, people! This is the sword that is worthy of my skills!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_592"><span class="indent"><span>Just like that, Basson and his posse were bragging with his weapon at every opportunity.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_593"><span class="indent"><span>The news that the tenth floor’s Level Boss would drop rare-grade equipment began to spread among the challengers.

This was what led to the latest situation within the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_595"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_596"><span class="indent"><span>I really needed to thank Basson and his party for promoting our nation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_597"><span class="indent"><span>That said, rushing straight into it was never a recipe for success in the labyrinth. After all, those who weren’t willing to listen to our instructions, were always beaten by people who finished their tutorial missions before challenging the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_598"><span class="indent"><span>Anyone with a bit of brain would know that the right thing to do was to listen to the instructions carefully first. Now, there were a lot more people who would do their tutorial mission seriously and receive their training on the first floor. The challengers were able to utilize the new knowledge they learned and apply it on the spot. There were also counters that sold various utility items, and this brought in a small fortune on its own.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_599"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_600"><span class="indent"><span>Moreover—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_601"><span class="indent"><span>A few days after our revamp of the labyrinth, there were teams that made their way to the fifth floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_602"><span class="indent"><span>The second floor was merely very wide, and up until the fourth floor, most of the traps were just for show. They were not exactly malicious in any way. As long as you sketched maps of the passages, it was a piece of cake to reach the fifth floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_603"><span class="indent"><span>That’s why it was a result that we expected.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_604"><span class="indent"><span>From the fifth floor onward, it was up to the challengers’ abilities. The lethality of the traps increased, and there were Rank D and above </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> roaming around the area.

It was likely just because of their exhaustion. Having to be on guard against </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> all the time would easily exhaust someone mentally.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_607"><span class="indent"><span>Many people returned to the stairs temporarily to use the resting zone. The business of the inns on level ninety-five had been booming as well, which was exactly what we wanted.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_608"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_609"><span class="indent"><span>Later, there were challengers that started making it to levels five through eight.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_610"><span class="indent"><span>The adventurers from different nations’ </span><span data-term="Freedom Association" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> branches had arrived as well. Among them were many skillful adventurers who were contracted by noblemen. The town had been bustling with life. People were discussing strategies with excitement.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_611"><span class="indent"><span>Because of the second group of people joining the battle, the morale of people who fought first was raised as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_612"><span class="indent"><span>It was then that some people began to cheat, ignoring proper rules of engagement and began to sell maps publicly within the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_613"><span class="indent"><span>Some people were probably super bad with direction like I am. Something like the labyrinth couldn’t be conquered with strength alone, that’s why I understood why they wanted to cheat in this way, but… I hoped they would just find companions to team up and assign each other’s role appropriately together.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_614"><span class="indent"><span>That’s why we were broadcasting, both inside and outside the labyrinth, that we would constantly change the internal layout. There were sad moans coming from the challengers all over the place, and many who just wouldn’t stop complaining about it. But I was the </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>—I was in no way obligated to listen to their opinions.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_615"><span class="indent"><span>I hoped to make them realize, sooner rather than later, that they wouldn’t be able to use maps not made by themselves. Essentially, if you didn’t make maps yourself, you would be unable to tackle the structural change of the labyrinth during your conquest. In a sense, this was a friendly reminder for them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_616"><span class="italic indent"><span>I suppose this is what they call tough love.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_617"><span class="indent"><span>The frequency of the layout changes was around once every two to three days. It would take at least a couple hours to break through one floor. It didn’t seem plausible that they’d make it to the checkpoint on the tenth floor without encountering a change.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_618"><span class="indent"><span>That’s why the change in the layout of the labyrinth had many benefits. Challengers would start to strategize properly and give up on buying and selling maps. There would probably be people starting the conquest as soon as the layout change began and try to sketch and sell maps within the same day. Those people could do whatever they wanted.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_619"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_620"><span class="indent"><span>We integrated this feature so as to prevent cheaters, and I was greatly satisfied with the result.

Moreover, their strong suit was their division of roles. Basson’ party only consisted of combat-type individuals, but the parties who joined later had well thought out structure of members.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_624"><span class="indent"><span>Against </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, there were raiders who specialize in combat.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_625"><span class="indent"><span>The traps and mazes were handled by explorers.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_626"><span class="indent"><span>There were also knowledgeable treasure hunters</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Kanji: 採取係, it’s a general term that refers to people who are good at gathering items, I can only assume it’s some very obscure game/novel reference because I can’t seem to find any modern trpg reference of this." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_627"><span class="indent"><span>The balance of a team was highly valued. As expected from adventurers who knew how to learn and adapt. They completed their missions with ease and challenged the labyrinth over and over.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_628"><span class="indent"><span>The people who were good at exploring ruins were also good at disabling traps. They were relatively calm when stumbling upon treasure chests, they were also more cautious compared to bodyguards or mercenaries. They had been displaying work ethic beyond our expectations. And they understood the rules almost instantly. I was fortunate that we didn’t make the labyrinth too easy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_629"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_630"><span class="indent"><span>And so, a few days after the different teams began to come in, there were already people who made it through the tenth floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_631"><span class="indent"><span>The morale of the challengers was greatly boosted. They were studying the strategies of the people who came before them. Strategize carefully and progress through each floor gradually. Once a floor was beaten, the news would spread quickly. People then started to imitate their strategy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_632"><span class="indent"><span>I suppose people were actually selling information about strategies.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_633"><span class="italic indent"><span>Should I praise their resourcefulness?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_634"><span class="indent"><span>So now that they realized selling maps wouldn’t work, they began to sell information instead. About that, I did want to commend their efforts. We wanted the atmosphere to become livelier as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_635"><span class="indent"><span>The active performance of the challengers also became a topic of discussion among the townsfolk.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_636"><span class="indent"><span>Shops, inns, restaurants—the news travelled from one to another. There were legendary stories of tragedies, comedies, and more. It was then that one story in particular was gaining popularity. There was a team that was progressing at lightning-fast speed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_637"><span class="indent"><span>They had a balanced team of ten people. What their team did to level up quickly was by sending one person to join another team that had already made it to level 10, register himself at the level 10 checkpoint and then utilized a ‘Return Whistle’ to get back to the entrance. From there on, he rejoined his actual team and would start immediately from level 10 and onward.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_638"><span class="indent"><span>We were already expecting such things, that’s why we felt fine about it. Their progress had been shockingly fast, nonetheless. It only took them a short span of three days before defeating the Level Boss on the twentieth floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_639"><span class="indent"><span>These guys were truly capable. Each of their abilities were up to Rank B. Their entire team was close to Rank B+. Moreover, the ten men’s cooperation was extremely well-coordinated, making their actual strength closer to Rank A-.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_640"><span class="indent"><span>It was almost impossible for me to not question their innocence, considering how fast they were progressing.

One of their magic skills was ‘Spirit Communication’, the ability to hear words spoken by the spirit. If they could communicate with wind or earth spirits, they would be able to find the right path leading to the stairs with ease. Since they could gain such information, things such as maze were meaningless for the spirit wielders.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_644"><span class="italic indent"><span>How cunning! Spirit wielders are so cunning!</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_645"><span class="indent"><span>That said, they weren’t breaking any rules. Depending on the different properties of the spirits they commanded, even if they used ‘Spirit Communication’, it wasn’t a guaranteed way to learn the correct route.

Because this ‘</span><span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ would heal all the severe wounds inflicted before death, and then revive the person. After much discussion, we came to the conclusion that we might as well give them this little bonus effect.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_762"><span class="indent"><span>In addition, if someone were to enter the labyrinth again without wearing the ‘</span><span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, we had to send a broadcast in order to get the attention of the person in question. Although they’d have to bear the responsibility, we still didn’t want lives to be lost out of negligence.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_763"><span class="indent"><span>To facilitate purchasing them, we situated the revival point next to the counter. This way, the ‘</span><span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ became a necessity. It was selling like hotcakes—the best, in fact, among the three items.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_764"><span class="indent"><span>The item ‘Return Whistle’ was limited to single-person usage. The benefit of it was that it could return the user to the outside instantly. It was a life-savor when you got lost. In essence, it was an item made for emergency usage. Its price was rather high, at a cost of thirty silver coins.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_765"><span class="indent"><span>Those who tried to save some cash by buying a ‘</span><span data-term="Revival Bracelet" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ instead of a ‘Return Whistle’ should reconsider their choices. After all, while you could return to the entrance after death in this way, you also had a chance to lose your equipment. Despite keeping your armor intact, any weapons that fell out of your hands would be left behind. No one in their right mind fought while holding on to their loot, they were more likely to lay that stuff on the hallway floor. Subsequently, those goodies wouldn’t be extracted, and, in a sense, it was a penalty for death.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_766"><span class="indent"><span>There aren’t many people who risked returning by dying, that’s probably why the item sold that well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_767"><span class="indent"><span>The sale of ‘Event Recording Globe’ was a lot worse than we expected. However, there was a history where a large amount of it was purchased. It cost one gold coin, an expensive price as it would convert to around a hundred thousand yen. It looked like some people had the foresight to purchase this expensive item in large quantities.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_768"><span class="indent"><span>You could easily utilize death to return to the entrance by using this item. I’m guessing that some people may be very stubborn in challenging the Level Bosses, so it’d be very dangerous to give away these items cheaply. This was why we set the price this high.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_769"><span class="indent"><span>Even with that being case, I still thought there would be demand for it. Upon reaching the deeper levels, the difficulty of the floors would increase drastically. Given that the checkpoint only appears every ten levels, it must give the challengers the impression of trying to reach heaven’s gate.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_770"><span class="indent"><span>I always thought that it would one day become profitable, even if just a little. Some people would, surely, find it useful.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_771"><span class="indent"><span>There were also other ideas, such as lending weapons and armor.

The only people using this seemed to be the ones who lost their weapons during their last attempt. However, it was slowly gaining popularity. When the rumors surrounding the amazing quality of the weapons spread far and wide, surely, there would be more people renting them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_772"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_773"><span class="indent"><span>Everything seemed to be going smoothly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_774"><span class="indent"><span>However, even if we finally landed some success, we still couldn’t get careless.

Not really, it’s just that the healing potions are surprisingly expensive. High ranking adventurers may have the spare cash to use them sparingly, but most average men won’t bear to use them.

That’s why, we might as well have </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> drop some low tier healing potions so that everyone can easily access them?

While a higher healing potion was sold for thirty-five silver coins. And regarding full healing potions, we weren’t even selling them on the market.

It cost five silver coins instead for included baths and a meal. Better inns, used mainly by merchants, cost around ten silver coins, excluding meals. This is the equivalent of a Rank D challenger’s entire day’s worth of work within the labyrinth. The average income was around fifteen silver coins. And even with a team to improve efficiency, it fell around twenty silver coins. This income was passable for now. It was sufficient to make a living with this money.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_823"><span class="indent"><span>But it may not be the case for any emergency situations.

It may even become a specialty of our nation. When we have enough profit, we may even invest part of it on healthcare.

That’s why we welcomed immigrants. But perhaps once our nation matured, we may even come down against immigration. The so-called nation, at its core, is just a massive mutual assistance organization. People can’t live on their own, that’s why they form communal groups to help each other out. That’s why we didn’t want any parasites in this nation.

We spent this time getting used to the avatars, and thus we began our training.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1999"><span class="indent"><span>We did things like fighting </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> on the upper levels or attacking newcomers who seemed like actual adventurers. During these few days, we began to assign roles and were getting pretty good at it. But before we had reached that level of teamwork, we took plenty of beatings.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2000"><span class="indent"><span>We were even losing to beginner teams on the upper floors. There were times when we were taken out by our own traps set in the labyrinth. Those were some awkward moments. That did really piss me off though, leading to the development of magic items that would prevent the labyrinth traps from getting triggered by us. However, the times we did fall to these traps would remain as fond memories.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2001"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris fell into a trap, getting Veldora tangled up in it as well. I floated into the air while Milim got pushed against the ceiling. Since I didn’t have to worry about getting caught in traps, I had gotten careless and forgot to alert them. It was a huge misstep, but, speaking of which, Ramiris… </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>How did you end up falling into a trap?</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;I could feel everyone relentlessly teasing her about it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2002"><span class="indent"><span>And so, as we endured, we trained all day and night without even catching a wink of sleep.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2003"><span class="indent"><span>In combat, the most important thing was coordination. Under normal circumstances, we would’ve been able to call out to each other or give signals with a glance. However, we didn’t have neat tricks like that. Mostly because Veldora and Milim were both tryhards.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2004"><span class="indent"><span>However, I did have a Skill that was basically like cheating. I could use ‘Telepathy Net’ to contact everyone and deliver them precise commands. With myself as the command post, Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris were my foot soldiers. And in that way, we drastically increased our strength and raised our standards.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2005"><span class="indent"><span>Once we could move with a certain level of confidence, we began to review our teamwork. Days passed as we waited for the equipment to be finished.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2006"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2007"><span class="indent"><span>It was then that we were informed about ‘</span><span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ managing to break through level forty.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2008"><span class="indent"><span>“This is bad.

However, in the case that a Level Boss won, the scars and tiredness accrued would remain. If it were to continue to fight, the circumstances would clearly be in the favor of the challengers.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2011"><span class="indent"><span>“That was our miscalculation. We should’ve provided more ways for the Level Bosses to heal themselves.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2012"><span class="indent"><span>“But all those </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> rely on instincts to survive,” Veldora commented. His rationale was that those </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> weren’t intelligent enough to use healing items.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2013"><span class="indent"><span>That was correct, but perhaps there was still a way.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2014"><span class="indent"><span>“Should we perhaps ask </span><span data-term="Treyni" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san for help?

Although it would greatly increase the chances of our victory, so we might as well give it a try.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2028"><span class="indent"><span>Upon thinking so, I was about to decide when—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2029"><span class="italic indent"><span>Knock knock.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2030"><span class="indent"><span>The sound of someone knocking on the door rang in the meeting room.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2031"><span class="indent"><span>“</span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-sama, </span><span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> wanted to tell you that ‘He’s ready’,” </span><span data-term="Shion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> notified me.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2032"><span class="indent"><span>Hearing the news, we looked at each other with grins on our faces.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2033"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2034"><span class="indent"><span>The gear specially crafted for our </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> avatars had been completed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2035"><span class="indent"><span>My gear were the Grim Reaper's scythe and robes of hell. A ghost could wear equipment as well, it was a specific property of magical gear.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2036"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora’s got the Grim Reaper’s bastard sword and full body armor of hell. His left hand was equipped with the great shield of hell’s gate. He was fully geared up.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2037"><span class="indent"><span>As for Milim who was playing a slime, she could only be equipped with simple things. She first swallowed the Grim Reaper’s </span><span data-term="javelin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and wore a crimson feathered cape. She immediately gained a pair of red wings after equipping it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2038"><span class="italic indent"><span>That’s some incredible change.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2039"><span class="indent"><span>“The gear has to be equipped or it won't activate the effect!” Milim said with glee.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2040"><span class="indent"><span>Since she was happy, I had no room to say anything.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2041"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris was next. She asked for heavy full body armor from </span><span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. The armor itself was finely crafted, the problem was whether or not she could wear it. Ramiris anxiously transferred herself to her avatar and tried to put on the armor. At that moment, lo and behold, the armor had been swapped out. With a loud ‘Clang’, the rubbish armor fell to the ground and turned into dust before being blown away by the wind.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2042"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris’s animated armor became heavy animated armor. This was not an evolution, and it also didn’t seem to be a change in equipment. Instead, the pieces of armor themselves swapped their places.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2043"><span class="indent"><span>“Eh, I move so swiftly now!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2044"><span class="indent"><span>Just as Ramiris said, before this her movement was very unnatural, like she needed to be lubricated. Now her movement looked very smooth. This would, surely, make coordination much smoother with her.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2045"><span class="indent"><span>I never expected the quality of the armor to have an effect on movement. What an unexpected discovery.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2046"><span class="indent"><span>Seeing how happy Ramiris looked, I asked her to choose her weapons and shield.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2047"><span class="indent"><span>“Pooh! Stuff like shields are unnecessary for me!” saying that, she chose a large two-handed weapon, the Grim Reaper’s great axe.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2048"><span class="indent"><span>Its sheer might makes it a top-notch weapon, though wielding it may prove difficult. But never mind that, this would do. She always got mocked for being weak, so she probably got a little carried away this time. Interestingly, it reflected her personality as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2049"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2050"><span class="indent"><span>And so, everyone changed to their new equipment.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2051"><span class="indent"><span>This equipment fell under unique-grade. Since they were adjusted to be equipped by </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, their designs, however, were rather unbalanced and comical in nature. Still, for any amateur adventurers, this was incredibly strong gear. We also applied some sort of a curse to register their users, so that they couldn’t be stolen. To us right now, these were the best gear out there.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2052"><span class="indent"><span>This new switch restored our resolve. Before we embarked on our battle, our spirits were soaring.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2053"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2054"><span class="indent"><span>We checked the status of our avatars.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2055"><span class="indent"><span>My ghost had given up physical attacks and focused on magic and mental attacks. It served the role of a sorcerer. I hoped to learn about ‘Spirit Magic’ and ‘Illusion Magic’ soon, since my goal was to become a wizard. Aside from that, I also wanted to learn ‘Holy Magic’. What would happen if I placed my faith in myself? That was kind of part of my experiment.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2056"><span class="indent"><span>Veldora’s skeleton swordsman was a Jack of all trades, he could do anything. He served the role of a heavy warrior, but seemed to want to learn magic and become a magic knight.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2057"><span class="indent"><span>Milim’s slime, on the other hand, specialized in speed and one-shot-kills. She’s the super buffed type. Or perhaps I should call her the romantic type?</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;TL note: I believe Romantic Type (" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;It was her job to be the assassin.

If the enemies fell for it, she’d look like a boss. But what would she do if the enemies saw through such a setup? Well, I think she would run away, considering her high mobility. In some ways, slime was the perfect form for this.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2059"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris’s heavy animated armor focused on strong attacks. It possessed some level of defense and even had the potential to be quite balanced. She fit the role of berserker. Not that she had really gone berserk, but it seemed that she has never considered her defensive capabilities. That was just how I had been calling her since she decided to become a dangerous </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> bent on attacking.

Bound by my mana pool, I could not use all the magic, but my vast arcane knowledge remained. Compared to a third-rate court mage, my magic was still leagues ahead.

Surely our enemy couldn’t handle that.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2072"><span class="indent"><span>As for Veldora, I almost suspected that he had a pair of eyes in the back of his head.

Looking at him closely enough, you would realize he was acting like a moron.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2076"><span class="indent"><span>On the other hand, we had Milim. She wasn’t lying when she said that she focused on speed. She zipped around at break-neck speeds. It was beyond what the average person could control, let alone replicate, yet with Milim’s reflexes, it was a piece of cake. Actually, I should say that that’s just how fast a slime could move when it got serious. She could ignore friction while sliding across the ground and closed in on the enemies with a bounce. The way she darted along the ceiling with the same speed, surely, made it close to impossible for your everyday adventurer to spot her clearly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2077"><span class="indent"><span>I was a slime as well, yet I’d never realized such a thing until now.

LET ME SHOW YOU HOW STRONG I AM!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2083"><span class="indent"><span>She led the charge as soon as we saw enemies. In addition, Ramiris’s combat style was to fight people head-on. Under normal circumstances, this was a risky move that rarely acted in her favor. She’s such an idiot. But for the rest of us, her doing so was the right tactic. After reminding her several times to no avail, we turned this in our favor. In short, we used Ramiris as bait while we launched a three-pronged attack.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2084"><span class="indent"><span>Normally, it would’ve been tricky to pull this off. But Ramiris set loose on a blind rampage, utterly disregarding defense. All the enemies saw was a large set of armor wielding the Grim Reaper’s great axe barreling towards them. By then, confronting it was inevitable.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2085"><span class="indent"><span>Because she completely neglected defense, all of their attacks were focused on Ramiris.

Sparing no cost and paying no mind to weight, the heavy animated armor was crafted out of thick sheets of magisteel. That imbued it with some level of ‘Self Reconstruction’, so a couple scratches were nothing to worry about. The sheer weight of the armor was enough to crush the average person, and imagining such a giant hunk of metal charging at you—the threat it posed to our enemies was readily apparent.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2087"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2088"><span class="indent"><span>Oh, and then there was my healing magic. As part of my experiment, I tried to cast ‘Holy Magic’ and found that I easily managed to pull it off, much to my surprise.

The main reason was due to growth in the scale of economies.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2136"><span class="indent"><span>In addition, the value of currency also changed. Currencies were once made of valuable metals such as gold and silver to ensure its value. However, in the new age, physical currencies were replaced by certificates and documents during trade.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2137"><span class="indent"><span>That was the birth of the paper money economy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2138"><span class="indent"><span>And so, a mechanism required for the money to flow was born—the banking system. You would receive receipts by storing your gold coins in a bank, and in return, you could exchange those receipts for the physical, material currency. The banks could utilize the money stored in them at will; thus, they came up with a different mode of business: loaning money to those in need and turning a profit by setting interest rates.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2139"><span class="indent"><span>This was a sorcery worse than alchemy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2140"><span class="indent"><span>Primarily, there was no money there, and yet, interest was accruing. On one hand was the total amount of physical money circulating in the market, and on the other was the total amount of receipts. When comparing the two, there would always be a certain unrecoverable difference… Someone would eventually have to pay the price for being unable to cover this fabricated margin.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2141"><span class="indent"><span>This fundamental issue was inherent to the system of lending money and receiving interest.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2142"><span class="indent"><span>Such a phenomenon became even worse when physical currencies were replaced by paper money. People would ask for loans from rich people with the interest rate as bait. Afterward, they would use the money to invest in financial products—to use money to make money. This cycle would continue beyond national boundaries and into the entire world.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2143"><span class="indent"><span>Guaranteed in the name of the state, cash would be printed without limits.

Seeing things being expressed in a familiar manner, I was able to quickly identify the situation and give the appropriate commands.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2359"><span class="indent"><span>Considering how things had developed, we had this one in the bag.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2360"><span class="indent"><span>Without the supporting aid from the back, the vanguard didn’t stand a chance against Veldora and Ramiris. They had no defensive buffs, spell or healing. With their HP decreased, they had no chance.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2361"><span class="indent"><span>If this were a more cautious team, they would have had a ‘Barrier’ set up at all times… But it seemed that the team wasn’t really that type.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2362"><span class="indent"><span>And so, Veldora and Ramiris happily slayed the three remaining foes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2363"><span class="indent"><span>It was an easy win.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2364"><span class="indent"><span>With Milim’s sneak attack on top of my magic, we were able to take out the scout and the rear guards—and that was our “gg ez” strategy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2365"><span class="indent"><span>However, we’d been picking too many fights lately, and it was inefficient. Even though the challengers’ strategies hadn’t been perfected, there were certainly more people thinking about them. The labyrinth challengers weren’t stupid. They were trying hard every day to improve as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2366"><span class="indent"><span>While that was certainly pleasant to hear, we also had to reconsider our engagement strategy with them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2367"><span class="indent"><span>—As I thought so, the last man in front of us disappeared, fading away in beams of light.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2368"><span class="indent"><span>The battle was over.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2369"><span class="indent"><span>I’d seen this scene a million times at this point.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2370"><span class="indent"><span>“Amazing!

We were using labyrinth challengers as the test subjects for our strategies.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2377"><span class="indent"><span>We all loved learning and had been studying tirelessly every, single, day.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2378"><span class="indent"><span>………</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2379"><span class="indent"><span>……</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2380"><span class="indent"><span>…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2381"><span class="indent"><span>Umm, but what about the whole ‘</span><span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’ deal from last time?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2382"><span class="indent"><span>It had been a great win, but we weren’t satisfied just yet.

They were apparently called back by their home nation, possibly never to return.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2383"><span class="indent"><span>With that being said, it might also have been because they had difficulty obtaining new gear for new levels. I was not sure whether they would return one day or not, but we had to get ready to fight them, nonetheless.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2384"><span class="indent"><span>That’s why, even if we had defeated ‘</span><span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, we were going to keep roaming the labyrinth in secret to fight off challengers. In addition, another reason was the increased popularity of the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2385"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2386"><span class="indent"><span>Several days had passed after our fight to the death with the ‘</span><span data-term="Green Rebellion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’. </span><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s party managed to break through level forty.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2387"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was the real lucky star as he managed to collect the </span><span data-term="ogre" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> weapon series.

And as we’d hoped, many capable individuals set their sights on level forty.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2388"><span class="indent"><span>We publicized the video footage of the Level Boss fight as a test and it was received very well. We used the video projector to record the fight between </span><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s team and the tempest serpent. It became a hot topic even within the town as people kept on requesting to replay the clip.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2389"><span class="indent"><span>There was money to be made with this—</span><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and I thought to ourselves. There was no television in this world, so the battle footage within the labyrinth was considered to be top tier entertainment. But, obviously, considering the potentially gruesome scenes that would be showcased, we considered editing the footage beforehand.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2390"><span class="indent"><span>However, some people seemed to prefer the uncut version. Therefore, there was some room reserved for negotiation in that regard—mainly depending on how much the people asking would pay.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2391"><span class="indent"><span>There were also issues regarding the broadcasting rights, portrait rights, etc. All of the cumbersome formalities were handed to </span><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2392"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s smile could probably be its own merchandise. That patented smile alone would earn us a sweet sum of money. In that way, </span><span data-term="Masayuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> would get some benefit, and </span><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and I would also be counting cash. Apart from learning from the mistakes, we were also looking forward to the future development of the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2393"><span class="indent"><span>The video footage was not limited to the video directly recorded by the magic item. We had actually saved a lot of things. Raphael-san also extracted a large amount of data from the labyrinth. By conducting “</span><span data-term="Analyze and Assess" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>” on it, it was possible to recreate the images. We also made video compilations of cool performances by the challengers and broadcasted them.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2394"><span class="indent"><span>They turned out to be a big hit. Some people were even saying “Thanks to this footage, I got to have a girlfriend!” Many people who wanted to become famous were tempted to give it a try. Even people who weren’t serious before, began to put in some hard work.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2395"><span class="indent"><span>I mean, I knew the feeling.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2396"><span class="indent"><span>Even though it might be cruel to say this, at least they put in more effort. But in front of them was a high wall called reality. Don’t be too idealistic just yet! On the notion of giving tough love to our contestants, </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>we </span></span><span class="indent"><span>began to interfere with the challengers’ progress.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2397"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2398"><span class="indent"><span>Nowadays we were called the ‘Dungeon Dominators’</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Kanji reads “Reapers of the labyrinth”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>, feared by all.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2399"><span class="indent"><span>Our appearance also had some drastic changes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2400"><span class="indent"><span>The ghost controlled by me now had </span><span data-term="youki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> surrounding it, engulfed in blue and white flames—a Fire Aura. I found this to be a very stylish look for me.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2401"><span class="indent"><span>As for Veldora’s skeleton swordsman, all of his bones were renewed. Seeing how Ramiris’s armor changed, Veldora wanted to renew his bones as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2402"><span class="indent"><span>I asked him what he wanted, and he responded rather recklessly, that “A gold skull suits me better.” I was just going to ignore his request at first. But since I also had </span><span data-term="Diablo" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s request to handle, I tried to change my perspective on the matter and thought that I could use Veldora as an experiment for temporary flesh replacement. I wanted to test the metallic skeleton body’s abilities, so I decided to exchange that with Veldora’s avatar.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2403"><span class="indent"><span>Ordinary gold wasn’t very strong. That was why I decided to utilize the strongest material I had available instead, though it was still in the experimental phase.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2404"><span class="indent"><span>It happened to be golden as well, so I decided to go ahead with it. It was called ‘orichalcum’</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Orichalcum or aurichalcum is a metal mentioned in several ancient writings, including the story of Atlantis in the Critias of Plato." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>, a special alloy refined from a mixture of magisteel and gold, while also infused with an unusually dense concentration of magicules. I wanted to combine the immutability of gold on top of the traits of magisteel.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2405"><span class="indent"><span>The result was very successful, not just in terms of strength. The overall performance of orichalcum exceeded magisteel; it was an incredible metal. And so, orichalcum was born.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2406"><span class="indent"><span>The problem with it, however, was the difficulty of its production. Gold itself was already rare and could not be produced en masse.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2407"><span class="indent"><span>However, this time I humored Veldora’s request. Which was why I spent a hefty sum of money making the orichalcum and fabricating the humanoid skeleton.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2408"><span class="indent"><span>As with Ramiris’ outfit, all we needed was a ‘Master Core’, since it didn’t matter what type of skeleton we had installed for Veldora. And in the blink of an eye, the golden skeleton swordsman was born in the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2409"><span class="indent"><span>His bones were insanely strong, nothing like his previous skeleton.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2410"><span class="indent"><span>I closely observed Veldora’s skeleton swordsman to examine its durability, as well as any potential flaws.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2411"><span class="indent"><span>Milim’s reputation, on the other hand, was even more far-reaching. People were all afraid of the infamous ‘Crimson Comet’. With her abnormal speed, her afterimage looked like a red comet.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2412"><span class="indent"><span>She abandoned all her techniques besides speed and focused on landing critical hits to achieve victory. This fighting style instilled fear and made her a legend.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2413"><span class="indent"><span>Ramiris’s style also changed slowly. She became the brawn type and had been giving off an ominous energy around her. She glowed with purple flames—her heavy animated armor was enveloped in an aura of death.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2414"><span class="indent"><span>She would wield her Grim Reaper’s great axe to crush her enemy and never backed down from a fight. This ended up giving her the reputation of the crazed heavy animated armor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2415"><span class="indent"><span>Her avatar might be stronger than her… No, never mind.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2416"><span class="indent"><span>For the sake of Ramiris’s own reputation, it was best to let matters lie.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2417"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2418"><span class="indent"><span>And so, in a span of a few days, we all became famous.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2419"><span class="indent"><span>The challengers’ response was pretty good as well. They all seemed to be afraid of us and kept their guard up against us. We were stronger than most low-level bosses, and also much meaner.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2420"><span class="indent"><span>It was only natural for the challengers to react this way.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2421"><span class="indent"><span>As I said before, our primary objective was to study how to fight within the labyrinth. We definitely weren’t just messing around for fun. You MUST not confuse that. We had been working hard every day and diving into our research. Surely, with the hard work that we’d put in, it would be useful someday.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2422"><span class="indent"><span>In fact, we had seen many challengers using rare Extra Skills as well as seemingly original magic spells. We had learned a lot from it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2423"><span class="indent"><span>Nowadays, Raphael-san could extract intelligence from the labyrinth directly, using ‘</span><span data-term="Analyze and Assess" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’, and so the labyrinth had become a vault of information.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2424"><span class="indent"><span>In addition, just as our own techniques would be reflected on the avatars, the things we learned via the avatars would also come back to our original bodies. This was an unexpected outcome, but was quickly considered as a new way to train.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2425"><span class="indent"><span>And so, we performed our research every day.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2426"><span class="indent"><span>Naturally, we made an ample amount of new discoveries.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2427"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2428"><span class="indent"><span>There was one time that we got a bit too arrogant and decided to challenge the entire labyrinth with our team.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2429"><span class="indent"><span>We quickly met our disastrous defeat.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2430"><span class="indent"><span>With our abilities alone, we could not even get past the Level Boss on the fiftieth floor—</span><span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. We couldn’t hold a candle to opponents above Rank A if we were to fight fairly. And even if we were to sneak attack, it wouldn’t have worked on </span><span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. He was like a brick wall standing in front of us.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2431"><span class="indent"><span>On one hand, we wanted to praise him for his competence, but on the other hand, we were thinking, “Now we will have to defeat him.” And based on this thought, we began to train our avatars with great enthusiasm.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2432"><span class="indent"><span>It was a form of learning one way or another. The process of training and self-improvement. And DEFINITELY not messing around for fun.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2433"><span class="indent"><span>Seriously, please remember this point in particular!</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2434"><span class="indent"><span>………</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2435"><span class="indent"><span>……</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2436"><span class="indent"><span>…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2437"><span class="indent"><span>And like that, we watched the challengers as they gradually disappeared.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2438"><span class="indent"><span>“That was an easy win.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2439"><span class="indent"><span>Hearing my comment, the other three nodded in agreement.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2440"><span class="indent"><span>This was around level thirty-eight. The Rank A- tempest serpent was almost in front of us. Its power wasn’t just for show, as its above average strength was much greater than that of most challengers. And to us in our avatars, if we were careless, we would also fall into a tough fight.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2441"><span class="indent"><span>Considering our growth rate, this was the perfect hunting ground. It was best to continue at this pace.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2442"><span class="indent"><span>Upon thinking so, my emergency contact ‘Clone’ in the office suddenly reached out to me.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2443"><span class="italic indent"><span>What happened?</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;As the thought crossed my mind, the message delivered by it to me was: “There is a guest that requires urgent attendance.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2444"><span class="italic indent"><span>Looks like this is no time for playin</span></span><span class="indent"><span>—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2445"><span class="indent"><span>No, no.

The fund would fluctuate depending on the size and scale of the nations, yet at the same time, all nations shared the same privileges. This led to some dissatisfaction, and therefore, the number of councilors for different nations needed to be increased when more responsibility was undertaken.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2539"><span class="indent"><span>However, with no restrictions to this rule, nations were no longer equal to each other.

Regardless of the size of the nation in the council, there was a duty to abide by international law. With that being said, the council had no authority to actually interfere with the internal affairs of its member states, which was reassuring to know.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3179"><span class="indent"><span>Every merchant was to abide by the trade laws of the nations they were trading in. If there were any problems, the matter would be settled according to the laws of the aforementioned nation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3180"><span class="indent"><span>If the merchants were dissatisfied about the verdict, they could file a complaint at the embassy of their home nations. There, it would be decided whether the issue would be elevated to a national level, or the merchants would just take the losses themselves.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3181"><span class="indent"><span>It seemed that we had handled the incident during the nation founding festival pretty well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3182"><span class="indent"><span>If it were to develop into a problem on a cross-national level, it would be trialed according to international law. We would need to proceed to the international court to seek a verdict, and there would have to be a third-party nation at the scene—in other words, it would be a matter to be judged by the council.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3183"><span class="indent"><span>The only councilors who didn’t have a say in the issue were the ones from the nation in question. It didn’t seem all too complicated. However, to be fair, we needed to publish our national laws first. That was the main issue, but I did have the reliable Raphael-san.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3184"><span class="indent"><span>We had gathered information about the laws in different nations and had a perfect, easily understood outline to act as the foundation of our nation’s law.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3185"><span class="indent"><span>We presented this as well, so there shouldn’t be any problems.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3186"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3187"><span class="indent"><span>As for opening the economic circle, that was gonna be problematic.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3188"><span class="indent"><span>The concept of a patent had yet to be introduced to this world. The current trend is that whoever could copy the design the best wins the race.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3189"><span class="indent"><span>But it was too early to be worrying about something small like advancing the patent industry. If any civilization became too advanced, they would be attacked by the ‘Army of Heaven’. As many as a million angels would attack from the sky, ransacking any towns on their way.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3190"><span class="indent"><span>That’s why the Western Nations didn’t have electricity or gas.

Its size was about the same as the first gate. Only this time, the door seemed to have been enchanted with some sort of spell.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4774"><span class="indent"><span>“—I see. This appears to have been enchanted with an ancient magic defense mechanism. If you accidentally disturb this contraption, the defensive mechanisms within the city may activate.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4775"><span class="indent"><span>“Defensive mechanisms? Are they still functioning?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4776"><span class="indent"><span>“Yes, please be very careful. If we were to trigger it accidentally, we may no longer be able to investigate the ruins,” Kagali-san advised everyone with a serious face. The team also seemed rather tense upon hearing her words.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4777"><span class="indent"><span>I was more curious about how Clayman opened this gate.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4778"><span class="indent"><span>“Is Clayman connected to these ruins in any way?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4779"><span class="indent"><span>“That guy only rose to power recently; he shouldn’t have anything to do with such ancient ruins.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4780"><span class="indent"><span>“Perhaps he was able to decode the sorcery and open the door with the correct procedure.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4781"><span class="indent"><span>Hmm-hmm.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4782"><span class="indent"><span>That’s right, even if it were Clayman, surely, he would’ve been able to undo the sorcery with enough time.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4783"><span class="italic indent"><span>By the way, I recall that Clayman had a Unique Skill as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4784"><span class="indent"><span>&lt;&lt;Correct. He possessed Unique Skill ‘Puppeteer’; he could receive or transmit information in encoded signals.&gt;&gt;</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4785"><span class="italic indent"><span>Yeah yeah yeah, that’s it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4786"><span class="indent"><span>It was some ability about analyzing intelligence, surely, it would be just as simple to analyze magic spells.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4787"><span class="italic indent"><span>By the way, did I obtain the Skill as well?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4788"><span class="indent"><span>&lt;&lt;Answer. It is an inferior version of master’s Skill; thus, it has been decomposed into energy and absorbed. If anything, the Skill ‘Ley Line Manipulation’ has been added to ‘</span><span data-term="Law Manipulation" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’.&gt;&gt;</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4789"><span class="italic indent"><span>I see, no wonder it didn’t report it to me.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4790"><span class="indent"><span>Because it wasn’t worth mentioning. That’s why Raphael-san never brought it up. But if Clayman could do it, so could I. Even though this would be Raphael-san doing all the actual work.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4791"><span class="indent"><span>“We may be stuck figuring this thing out for a long time.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4792"><span class="indent"><span>“We ran headfirst into a mighty challenging task. But our circumstances are already a lot better than what we’ve done in the past. Let’s calm down and analyze it carefully!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4793"><span class="indent"><span>The members of the exploration team talked amongst themselves in a display of motivation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4794"><span class="indent"><span>Ignoring them all, I put my hand on the gate. I instantly got a picture of the energy coming from the ‘ley lines’ permeating the wall in the form of magic spells.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4795"><span class="indent"><span>“I get it now. If we were to destroy this door, the lights on this level would all vanish. All of the energy would be used to repel the invaders before reconstructing itself. It’s still functioning normally even after more than a thousand years. Looks like this is a super advanced product born from the magic-wielding civilization.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4796"><span class="indent"><span>It was all Greek to me, but thanks to the help of the all-talented Raphael-san, I was able to unravel the matter easily. It was like playing a puzzle game, making it somewhat intriguing.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4797"><span class="indent"><span>Like solving an arithmetic problem. I undid the magic expressions one by one and finally found the way to open the gate.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4798"><span class="indent"><span>“Ah, there you go. By channeling magic here, we should be able to open the input window of the coded spell.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4799"><span class="indent"><span>I finished my sentence only to turn around and see the expedition team with their mouths hanging open.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4800"><span class="italic indent"><span>Oh snap, I overdid that a bit</span></span><span class="indent"><span>—I suddenly realized.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4801"><span class="indent"><span>I accidentally started analyzing due to it being so interesting. This was supposed to be their job.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4802"><span class="indent"><span>“Sorry, I got ahead of myself…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4803"><span class="indent"><span>“I-it’s alright, don’t worry about it,” Kagali-san said to comfort me, but I still felt that I owed an apology to everyone.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4804"><span class="indent"><span>I reflected upon what I’d done while petting Ranga as I patiently waited.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4805"><span class="indent"><span>—That’s what I should have done. But my own teammates couldn’t contain themselves.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4806"><span class="indent"><span>“WAHAHAHA! I want to solve it as well!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4807"><span class="indent"><span>“I give up.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4808"><span class="indent"><span>Milim started shouting loudly, prancing before the gate, while </span><span data-term="Gobta" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> couldn’t figure out a thing.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4809"><span class="indent"><span>That seemed to cheer up the other teammates and they began to discuss. The spark to drive the situation was the question Kagali-san asked, “</span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-sama, could I ask you about something? How did you analyze the puzzle?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4810"><span class="indent"><span>By then I was stroking Ranga’s fur. But since she’d asked, I couldn’t very well withhold an answer. To quench her thirst for clarification, I explained the analysis method in detail.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4811"><span class="indent"><span>“First, we need to investigate what sort of magical expressions were used before it came to be, then we could sort those expressions into different stages.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4812"><span class="indent"><span>“Do you mean to identify the most recently used magical expression?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4813"><span class="indent"><span>“Right, we then probe what should be removed from the end-product to prevent that magical expression from activating. Repeat this process for the expression before it and so on until you grasp the foundation—that is the underlying flow, the nucleus, of this mechanism. Then, after that, it will conversely give you only the right answers.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4814"><span class="indent"><span>“I see…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4815"><span class="indent"><span>“Ruling out false leads and only preserving the expressions that are functioning correctly, is it?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4816"><span class="indent"><span>No wonder why everyone present here was an elite, they immediately understood the method merely from listening to my short suggestion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4817"><span class="indent"><span>“Aren’t trap-type expressions complete on their own in many cases? They are like branches and leaves of a large tree that grow close together, parts that do not belong to the central roots and the trunk. This is, assuming that the expressions are not primarily intended to trigger the trap.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4818"><span class="indent"><span>“…I see. So even if it’s the main stem of the expressions, we still shouldn’t let our guard down.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4819"><span class="indent"><span>My teaching style seemed to be easy to understand, maybe because I had experience teaching kids. I was pleased to see that it was pretty well received, so I continued to demonstrate more and more of the puzzle analysis.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4820"><span class="indent"><span>During this time, Milim opened the gate almost immediately. Later on, a couple of our teammates managed to open the door successfully as well. It was then that the chief called us.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4821"><span class="indent"><span>“Everyone, we have prepared meals. You must be tired after your arduous journey; shall we call it a day?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4822"><span class="indent"><span>Having it pointed out, I realized it was already evening.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4823"><span class="indent"><span>She had a point, we could begin our exploration officially tomorrow. We would open the gate tomorrow and close up shop for now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4824"><span class="indent"><span>“Shall we stop for the day?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4825"><span class="indent"><span>“I concur.

We shall begin the investigation officially tomorrow.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4826"><span class="indent"><span>With Kagali-san’s consent, the day came to a close.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4827"><span class="indent"></span></p><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

It tasted like mayonnaise and could even turn crumbly bread soft. And for people who still thought the bread was too tough, they could drink the warm vegetable soup from a large wooden bowl.

A female teammate volunteered herself, saying that she could use ‘Spirit Magic’.

But it’s gonna be a huge project to construct the map…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4902"><span class="indent"><span>That’s true. The caster would be exhausted after hearing the voice of the spirit for a prolonged period of time, so it was better to draft a map.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4903"><span class="indent"><span>In my case, Raphael-sensei would handle all that for me.

There was a spell book in the library called “Mischief Magic Illustrated”, a rather silly name.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4907"><span class="indent"><span>&lt;&lt;Report.

A slime’s cells are very great, and its memory is a lot better. It’s almost the same as when I was human.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4910"><span class="indent"><span>“Can anyone use ‘Illusion Magic’?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4911"><span class="indent"><span>“A-although I’m still an apprentice, I </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>am</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;a sorcerer!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4912"><span class="indent"><span>“Then can you try to learn this spell, also—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4913"><span class="indent"><span>Regarding the means of sharing information, making use of ‘Telepathy Net’ made things a lot easier. But for something that any average human could use, perhaps a spell would be more convenient.

These alone should make us bank, right?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4955"><span class="indent"><span>Milim was right, most of her trophies were gear. This was already elite gear crafted by master smiths when they were first made. With the times they have endured, their magisteel has completely matured, making their quality skyrocket.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4956"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh oh, it’s true.

The other teammates testified for them as well, so it was the truth. It looked like the location had stored some sort of response patterns of specific types of creatures. The trap would be triggered when anyone outside of the registered patterns entered. In that way, unless the visitors knew the wavelengths needed to pass beforehand, there was no way anyone could have decoded that.

Analyzing this door seems to need more time, tomorrow—” Kagali-san was abruptly cut off as the earth suddenly began to shake. Including the ruins, the area suddenly experienced a huge energy reaction.

AMALITA HAS BEEN INFILTRATED, EXTERMINATE INVADERS!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4990"><span class="indent"><span>The repetition of the voice gave me nothing but a premonition of danger.

I should not have hesitated for the sake of the future. If she had tried to inflict harm on me, my doubt would have disappeared.

That was the pistol name that actually exists in real life, “Walther P99”. We were going to use kanji for the numbers, but it seems that weapons from the real world are an exception to that.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5786"><span class="indent"><span>The weapon that Glenda used in the novel was a semi-automatic pistol developed by the German weapon manufacturer Walther. And of course, it is real.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5787"><span class="indent"><span>At first, I was considering whether I should use a pistol produced by Beretta, such as the M92 or PX4, but if I did, it may get mixed up with the character Beretta. That’s why I got pretty frustrated trying to decide which gun to choose, before finally settling on the P99.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5788"><span class="indent"><span>Speaking of Walther, their P38 is quite famous. The highly popular master thief (Lupin III)</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;Lupin the Third is a Japanese manga series." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;also uses this weapon, so it’s very well known. I initially wanted to get some of his clout but decided not to in the end.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5789"><span class="indent"><span>Glenda-san is a female, so a smaller and more compact weapon is probably more suited for her. Based on this consideration, I settled on the gun that was introduced this time, the “Walther P99”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5790"><span class="indent"><span>Its name only appeared once, but in order to write about it, I researched a bunch and even bought an airsoft version of it. It was then that I recalled I wanted one when I was a kid. I suppose this can be considered as me fulfilling a childhood dream, now that I have the money as an adult—uh, but I digress.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5791"><span class="indent"><span>That’s the type of gun it was. I plan to make it show up a couple of times in the future as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5792"><span class="indent"><span>There are mechanical and magic type pistols. While the pistols in question have the same names, the two are very different from each other.

It only looked similar in appearance. It also seemed to require gunpowder, but I felt that there was too much complication. Can’t we make it a bit simpler? That’s why I gave the final pistol some magic modification.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5793"><span class="indent"><span>Furthermore, in the book I hinted at the fact that the Empire had guns as well. So, I plan to write something completely different for them.

On the other hand, the series of magic dolls, like Beretta, would be named after gun manufacturers.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5796"><span class="indent"><span>In the web novel, Beretta didn’t have any brothers.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5797"><span class="indent"><span>So, what should we do?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5798"><span class="indent"><span>The reason why we mentioned naming Walther was in hope that </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> would recall the matter…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_5799"><span class="indent"><span>Sig, Colt, Glock, Mauser, Mateba, Remington.
