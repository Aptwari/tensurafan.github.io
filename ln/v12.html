We wouldn’t be able to welcome anyone willy nilly; only authorized adventurers, merchants, and those with referrals or other credentials would have the right to enter. It was a precaution to safeguard against spies, but there was another reason as well: To sort out the entrants.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1091"><span class="indent"><span>Not all visitors to our country were human, and the abilities of individuals ranged widely. Many of the strangers were uncivilized, and if we accepted them in large numbers, we wouldn’t be able to keep up with them. After all, there was no way to stop idiots from running amok, despite strictly forbidding fighting in the city. We had barriers in place for that exact reason, but it was still difficult to completely prevent the usage of magic.

We had decided to educate the entrants a little about the rules of our country at the time of their entry. That was what the entry inspection was all about, as for those who wished to migrate to our country, a more formal preparation was a priority. We set up a separate, dedicated place that they could attend.

At the time of inspection, visitors were screened and asked why they were visiting. Preventing the influx of people who didn’t have money was one way to prevent unnecessary trouble.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1095"><span class="indent"><span>There were a lot of normal inns near the </span><span data-term="Colosseum" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, but the people that used those weren’t very wealthy.

But there was essentially no upper limit, as we even had rooms prepared that cost ten gold coins and more—</span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>wait, why am I advertising…? </span></span><span class="indent"><span>Well, this was how we segmented things.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1098"><span class="indent"><span>I wanted to make Tempest a tourist hotspot, so we’d been trying our best to advertise our city by gifting vouchers for high-class inns to merchants who made large deals with us, and to those who beat Floor 10 of the labyrinth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1099"><span class="indent"><span>Our strategy was well-received by the challengers of the labyrinth. The widely known exquisite quality of our food was a tremendous motivator. The meals alone cost more than ten silver coins. Considering that you could stay at a cheap inn for just three silver coins, you might feel that this was absurdly expensive. However, one might wish to indulge in luxury once in a blue moon, and some people certainly had that kind of cash from challenging the labyrinth. As hosts, it was our job to offer places for those types of people to spend money on, too.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1100"><span class="indent"><span>Speaking of which, clearing Floor 10 of the labyrinth was equivalent to a group defeating a black spider, a B-ranked </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>—in other words, a team of rank C-plus adventurers or higher.

Therefore, I had no qualms about granting these adventurers corresponding privileges.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1101"><span class="indent"><span>Furthermore, if you viewed it through the lens of a small country, they would be strong enough to be hired as knights.

Before my meeting with </span><span data-term="Benimaru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, which had become a daily routine, I went through these same plans once more.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1169"><span class="indent"><span>In case they chose the Great Jura Forest route, which we defended, it was obvious that the greatest obstacle, from the Empire’s perspective, was Veldora’s existence. They wouldn’t attempt a frontal assault, so they’d probably try to trick Veldora by preparing a decoy unit. With that in mind, I had to consider our country’s defensive setup.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1170"><span class="indent"><span>There were three possible routes for initiating military operations within the Great Jura Forest. However, one of them was adjacent to Dwargon’s territory. If the Empire ignored our warning and came to invade, the Dwarven Kingdom and our army could catch them in a pincer attack. The Empire would definitely be aware of how dangerous this option was, so I think it’s fine to set a lower alert level. It was more likely that the Empire would strike by using one of the two remaining routes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1171"><span class="italic indent"><span>But is it really that straightforward? </span></span><span class="indent"><span>It was a bad idea to split your forces when facing a large enemy, so we could deploy Veldora on one side and our full army on the other. If we employed this tactic, then we should be able to handle the Empire, even if they prepared a diversionary force.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1172"><span class="indent"><span>Even I, who was by no means an expert in military affairs, could formulate something like this. Thus, I had my doubts that professional soldiers would set out to war with such a simple strategy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1173"><span class="indent"><span>There was also the possibility that the Empire was looking down on us—thinking that with an overwhelmingly massive army, they could trample over us, regardless of Veldora or our </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> army. On the other hand, perhaps they would utilize an underhanded strategy instead of facing us head on.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1174"><span class="indent"><span>For instance, they could use the regular army as bait and initiate guerrilla warfare with elite troops in small groups. What if they split into platoon-sized units in order to infiltrate the forest and then regrouped somewhere else?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1175"><span class="indent"><span>In these cases, it’d be impossible to monitor all of the minor trails throughout the woods. If we carelessly deployed a reconnaissance force, depending on the scale of the enemy, it might come back to haunt us. Just like what </span><span data-term="Hinata" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> had done before if a platoon of </span><span data-term="Holy Knight" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-level troops were dispatched…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1176"><span class="indent"><span>If we took that prospect into account, there wouldn’t be enough troops to cover all possible incursions. It was risky if we moved to intercept the Empire after determining their objective, so I wanted to avoid that as much as possible. And if we lost the initiative, there was the chance that we’d fall into an unrecoverable position.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1177"><span class="indent"><span>Although we were trying to be vigilant for that exact reason, the crux of the matter was that we couldn’t read the Empire’s movements. In war, the more unpredictable you were, the bigger the advantage you held over your opponent. Oftentimes, making an unexpected move would be enough to clinch a victory. As a result, we had to consider every single possible scenario…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1178"><span class="italic indent"><span>It’s no use; my mind’s going in circles. </span></span><span class="indent"><span>I became irritated when those thoughts bubbled up. Wouldn’t it really be better for me to attack first? Or rather, wouldn’t attempting a Blitzkrieg, the moment the Empire declared war be the correct answer?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1179"><span class="indent"><span>Since we couldn’t guarantee that the Empire would move according to our predictions, it was pointless to dwell further on this subject. No matter how many times I thought it over, I felt that launching a preemptive strike was the rational thing to do, rather than waiting for an opponent to make their move. We wouldn’t be overwhelmed with worries and could seize the initiative.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1180"><span class="italic indent"><span>…Well, I won’t do it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1181"><span class="indent"><span>No matter how long I mulled it over, the </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>perfect</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;answer wouldn’t drop from the sky.

Of course, there was more to this support system than meets the eye; it demanded something in return. For example, if we built a dam, depending on how much we invested in the construction, we would acquire an equivalent value in water rights as compensation. As for laying railroad tracks, we would charge a tax on the train fare and collect the profits in perpetuity.

It had been built over a hundred years to serve as a bridgehead to invade the forest. They had hoped to turn this city into a military stronghold in order to break through the forest and further expand the Empire’s territories. Driven by this ambition, the military at the time began to draft an assault plan.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1547"><span class="indent"><span>They had to cross the Great Jura Forest. They had spent the past century longing for this opportunity. They were already a prosperous nation, and so there was only one reason why they hoped to expand their territories further: It was their emperor’s wish. There was no other reason, and none of the Empire’s citizens had any complaints.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1548"><span class="indent"><span>The plan proceeded smoothly, and as the Empire’s army gradually accumulated power, they were ready to display their military prowess. Soon enough, they were given orders to invade the forest in the name of the emperor. However, all plans for the invasion were thwarted by the foolish idea of a certain troop captain.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1549"><span class="italic indent"><span>Since we are here, we might as well subjugate the ruler of the Great Jura Forest too.

Yet it was merely superficial: in reality, these nobles had no actual decision-making power. They merely enjoyed the honor and privilege, while staying beholden to the emperor’s will. At most, they were just bureaucrats.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1558"><span class="indent"><span>The power of the nobles was hereditary, and they could become senators without being elected. Even if they were extremely ambitious, they would never have enough power to achieve their dream. All of the territories of the Empire belonged to the emperor. The nobles were merely leased the land for temporary management.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1559"><span class="indent"><span>The ones supporting the nobles were highly-educated officials. It was these officials who handled all the planning. They were directly supported by the emperor, since these officials had all sworn allegiance to him.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1560"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1561"><span class="indent"><span>Up next is the military department. The supreme decision-making power of the military did not belong to the nation, but the emperor. All of the Empire’s military power was centered on the emperor. This also applied to the nations that had been annexed by the Empire. All of their territories were claimed, and their land now became the property of the emperor. So were the defense troops deployed there, where they were considered as a generous gift from the emperor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1562"><span class="indent"><span>This policy was effective in completely eliminating any form of rebellion in the provinces. The overwhelming difference in national power was the key to its success.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1563"><span class="indent"><span>The Empire would accept the surrender of other nations, but it was the equivalent of forfeiting all of their rights. If one of them rejected those terms and launched a rebellion, they would be met with a bloody purge. The Empire did this to deter even the thought of insurrection, cutting off the very roots of rebellion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1564"><span class="indent"><span>In that manner, the Empire managed to maintain order. On the one hand, the fear of their tyranny, and on the other, ensuring the livelihoods of its loyal subjects—the quintessential carrot and stick policy. Through this, the Empire managed to maintain peace and prosperity with its complete authoritarian control.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1565"><span class="indent"><span>It was normally impossible for an empire of this scale to be ruled by a single person. Yet even so, throughout its two millennia of history, the dominance of the emperor had never been shaken. Generation after generation, the emperor’s authority never faded. By all accounts, it was an extraordinary feat. If all of this truly was the emperor’s own doing, he was a being that transcended the mortal realm.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1566"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1567"><span class="indent"><span>Moving on, let us have a look at the military strength of the Empire. The structure of their military could be roughly divided into three major corps.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1568"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1569"><span class="indent"><span>The Armored Corps—an army modified by armored technicians consisting of mainly mechanized troops. They were the modernized Armed Corps and their arsenal included heavy weaponry, such as tanks. They symbolized the Empire’s technology.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1570"><span class="indent"><span>The Magic Beast Corps—an army consisting of all sorts of magic beasts captured by the Empire from various regions across the world, within their domain and otherwise. The corps manipulated the magic beasts and wielded their power. They symbolized the Empire’s strength.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1571"><span class="indent"><span>The Mixed Corps—a cesspool where nonstandard mechanized troops and uncontrollable, ferocious magic beasts were dumped, loosely resembling an army. This corps was considered to be too reliant on individual strength and unsuited for organized group action. However, their total strength was unknown, and if united, could potentially pose a tremendous threat. They symbolized the Empire’s heart. Though, this “heart” was not mature enough yet.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1572"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1573"><span class="indent"><span>Unlike the Western Nations, which focused its military power on swords and magic, the Empire was pioneering a new era with magic and science. The existence of otherworlders played a major role in the growth of the Empire’s military power.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1574"><span class="indent"><span>Someone had seen potential in the knowledge brought from the other worlds, an archmage, one who had lived for a long time within the palace, named </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. Despite his elderly appearance, the man was extremely energetic. He craved knowledge of all kinds, even outside the field of magic. He was also very fond of hearing the stories told by people from other worlds. That was how he learned that there were many other nations in other worlds as well. Unlike this world, the residents of these other worlds spoke different languages and had different ideologies. Yet, even then, they were able to overcome their differences and coexist. He also learnt that other worlds had no magic, yet their civilizations were highly developed and completely different to this world’s.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1575"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> had lived for a long time. Every time his life was about to come to an end, he would undergo the secret ritual he invented—the mystic art of ‘Reincarnation’—in order to rewind his lifespan. It was this ability that allowed him to study otherworlders over many lifetimes. He amassed a wealth of knowledge, including several otherworld languages. In addition, whenever otherworlders arrived in this world, he would send his subjects to ensure that they were under his personal protection. Magical beasts weren’t the only thing the Empire was collecting.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1576"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> also appealed to the emperor on the practical use of otherworlders and was given the permission to do as he wished with them. Some of these otherworlders possessed unusual abilities, and some possessed vast knowledge. The otherworlders arriving at the borders of the Empire received special treatment, and far more had gathered there than any other nation. As a result, their cultures and traditions were seen across the Empire.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1577"><span class="indent"><span>Naturally, the Empire realized that many of them possessed Unique Skills and thus carried out further research. Because of them, the Imperial Army’s technology continued to develop to the point that it likely surpassed all the other nations in the world.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1578"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1579"><span class="indent"><span>The Empire had abandoned the use of knights. Fighting on horseback had long since become obsolete, and in its place, battles were fought with modernized weaponry. Soldiers who replaced their flesh and bones with steel and machinery were called “mechaknights,”</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;For clarification, the author made a wordplay on the phrase “Knight” (Kishin) in Japanese.

The Armored Corps, the main force of the Empire, strongly exemplified this feature.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1580"><span class="indent"><span>In addition, the Magic Beast Corps also cleverly used the knowledge of the other worlds. DNA, also known as deoxyribonucleic acid, was a biological macromolecule that held the genetic information of biological beings. Having gained this knowledge from the otherworlders, the Empire was able to analyze the strength of the magic beasts. They even went a step further in their research…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1581"><span class="indent"><span>As for the Mixed Corps, it consisted of many powerful otherworlders. Every one of them had awakened their Unique Skills. They were a force to be reckoned with.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1582"><span class="indent"><span>And so, by cleverly combining the technology from the other worlds and special abilities, the Empire created an incredibly powerful army. You wouldn’t be wrong to attribute much of the Empire’s steady growth to </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s passion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1583"><span class="indent"><span>However, separate to the three main corps </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> developed, there was another group in charge of protecting the emperor. This group was, at most, the size of a company, which was a hundred men. It was called the “</span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.” The members were called “Imperial Knights,”</span></span><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="&nbsp;The Imperial Knights had the ruby text “Royal Knights” in the original Japanese, which is a misnomer." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"><span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;despite the term “knight” being a relic of a bygone era. A clueless outsider might think that they were merely a formality, or like their name, a remnant from the past. But that was far from the truth. The Imperial Knights of the </span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were the elite of the elite, handpicked from each of the corps.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1584"><span class="indent"><span>Among them were otherworlders, which only further proved their commitment to the credo that “Power is everything,” by disregarding any prejudice over a person’s home country. These people had not gained their titles through their family’s name or influence in this old empire, but purely on their own merit. There were rumors saying that the </span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were all gifted legendary-grade weapons as proof that they were the strongest among men. These powerful elites paired with the best gear could take on thousands of foes on their own. Their combined strength was superior to that of every corps combined.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1585"><span class="indent"><span>They were also guaranteed the best treatment. Each one of them had the rank of a senior officer. When they carried out special missions, they were granted the authority of a colonel, at minimum. They were the </span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, admired by the Empire’s soldiers as the greatest force of the Empire.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1586"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1587"><span class="indent"><span>In conclusion, there were four military corps within the Empire. To be the commanding general of these corps, one had to demonstrate adequate military prowess to force those below into obedience. They had to make sure that everyone recognized why they were the strongest within the Empire.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1588"><span class="indent"><span>So, how would they prove this?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1589"><span class="indent"><span>This was done through competition for ranks—a rank battle—within the Empire’s military. So long as the battle was supervised by a neutral third party, this system allowed a lower-ranking individual to challenge his superior. In other words, it allowed insubordination. As a result, ranks within the corps often fluctuated.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1590"><span class="indent"><span>Naturally, several conditions had to be met for these rank battles to be approved. They could not be held during a military operation. It would be rendered invalid without the presence of a witness. Moreover, if the challenging party were defeated, they would need to wait another year before regaining the right to challenge. The same rule applied if the challenger killed their opponent.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1591"><span class="indent"><span>Since superior officers were allowed to kill their challengers, these challenges had to be treated with caution. The challenger had to utilize an overwhelming amount of strength in order to make their opponent admit defeat. This system was very much in line with the Empire’s philosophy, “Power is everything.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1592"><span class="indent"><span>Nevertheless, there was no shortage of people who hoped to climb the ranks to become </span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. The Empire’s ideology was engraved on the people’s hearts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1593"><span class="indent"><span>This was how the rankings within the Empire were decided. However, </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was exempted from this rule. Due to his special position, he was like a foreigner to the Empire.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1594"><span class="indent"><span>Excluding </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, the Empire would select soldiers from the rest of the military to join the ranks of the </span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, as well as elect the corps commanders. When a replacement was needed, candidates would be chosen from among the top 100 ranks.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1595"><span class="indent"><span>Those who wished to climb the ranks of office were given equal opportunity. That was why those who truly possessed strength would not go unnoticed. Everyone continuously honed their skills, eager to demonstrate their talents.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1596"><span class="indent"><span>Through this method, the Empire would elect one marshal, the most highly-ranked officer, and three generals. In addition, the highest-ranking individual would automatically be elected as the marshal. In contrast, only after the emperor, the marshal, and </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> had discussed the matter would they appoint the appropriate candidates as the generals. The reasoning was very simple: strength didn’t always translate to strategic command.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1597"><span class="indent"><span>All in all, the members who remained in each corps were weaker than the </span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, so there was no doubt that the generals who became the corps commanders would all be the most capable elites in their respective corps. This was how the commanders of the corps were decided. These four individuals were the highly esteemed people representing the Empire to the public.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1598"><span class="indent"><span>The marshal and the three generals would receive gear appropriate for their position. Since the members of the </span><span data-term="Imperial Guardians" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> received legendary-grade gear, the gifts to these four individuals must therefore be superior, secret treasures of the Empire. These were the strongest treasured items, those whose power was wielded during the many conquests in the ancient times—mythical-grade gear.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1599"><span class="indent"><span>The fact that the Empire possessed multiple mythical-grade items, the existence of which itself was often questioned, underpinned their prestige. The ultimate gear that no mortal human could ever dream of touching. Only those worthy could wield it. Once the gear itself approved of them could they unleash their true power. Only the strongest deserved this ultimate power. These individuals seemed almost invincible, and so the Empire managed to stand, unshaken.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1600"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1601"><span class="indent"><span>Yet as time passed…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1602"><span class="indent"><span>An anomaly appeared in the Empire.

You could get one for free like a one-time deal from the reception desk. With the bracelet equipped, you would revive back at the entrance upon dying in the labyrinth, so they were told.

It was certainly strong, but it was no match for us.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2200"><span class="indent"><span>The tempest serpent was ranked A-minus, so even high-level adventurers struggled against it. Its breath attack, covering a wide-area, was devastating in small rooms. The challengers had no place to escape, leaving them no choice but to face the enemy head on. If the snake managed to wrap itself around you though, its tough scales meant you were a definite goner.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2201"><span class="indent"><span>This </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was supposed to be a tricky opponent, but Shinji’s crew beat it without breaking much of a sweat.

It’s listed for a crazy price…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2203"><span class="indent"><span>The ridiculous number threw them for a loop, enough to make them drop the idea of selling it. Weapons with holes began to appear in loot starting around the 40th floor. No one had ever seen anything like it in the Empire, so naturally the three of them had no idea how much they were worth. They could’ve sold them for a fortune, but they remained on the fence about whether they should.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2204"><span class="indent"><span>“What’s the deal with this hole? Even my appraisal magic tells me nothing, maybe we should hold onto them until Master comes.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2205"><span class="indent"><span>“These kinds of weapons didn’t appear before the 40th floor.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2206"><span class="indent"><span>“…Yeah.

They say that they’re an exceptional find in treasure chests on the 30th floor and below.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2208"><span class="indent"><span>“I guess so, since its build-quality is impeccable.

Let’s keep them until the old man gets here. But more importantly, this is the deal.

A high-class masterpiece made of mithril. It was a unique-grade weapon, obtained from the treasure chest protected by the guardian of the 50th floor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2213"><span class="indent"><span>“It’s a Unique weapon, you know? Even in the Empire it’s impossible to get a unique-grade, right?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2214"><span class="indent"><span>Mark was so enthralled by it that he was practically rubbing his cheek against the bardiche.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2215"><span class="indent"><span>It was undeniably a powerful weapon.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2216"><span class="indent"><span>If you became an Imperial Guardian of the Empire, you would be lent legendary-grade weapons. While soldiers of lower ranks were given equipment that had good quality and strength, they lacked any magical properties.

Logically, at least, that shouldn’t be possible.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2219"><span class="indent"><span>“Shinji, isn’t that an outlandish assumption?” Mark scoffed. “You think they can be mass produced just because they have the same shape?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2220"><span class="indent"><span>He didn’t like the idea, since it meant that his newly-acquired unique-grade weapon wasn’t worth nearly that much.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2221"><span class="indent"><span>“Of course, doing it with normal means would be impossible. Master </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> himself noted that even the mass-production of magisteel is too difficult. But it’s </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>not</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;impossible if you can maintain a special environment.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2222"><span class="indent"><span>“…A special environment?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2223"><span class="indent"><span>“Yeah.” Shinji continued, “An environment so densely packed with magicules, it’d kill a man just by standing in it. Someone at rank B wouldn’t make it long either, and even someone ranked A probably wouldn’t make it out without getting sick. If a piece of armor were kept in a place with such an environment for a long period of time—maybe a hundred to a thousand years—it would then be ready to evolve. After that, if a capable owner were recognized by the armor, it would start its own evolution from there.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2224"><span class="indent"><span>“Surely such conditions don’t exist?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2225"><span class="indent"><span>“…Yeah, I think it’s impossible as well.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2226"><span class="indent"><span>“Right? But </span><span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san and Master </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> said otherwise,” Shinji insisted.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2227"><span class="indent"><span>“—So, even if it </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>was</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;possible, what’s your point?” Mark shot back.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2228"><span class="indent"><span>“Well, look. I was just wondering if this bardiche was produced in such a way.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2229"><span class="indent"><span>“No way…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2230"><span class="indent"><span>“You don’t think so, huh? But listen, there’s also a hole in this bardiche. You wouldn’t see this on your run-of-the-mill bardiche, right?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2231"><span class="indent"><span>“True. I wonder what this is…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2232"><span class="indent"><span>“…It’s a beautiful weapon, nonetheless. Although it has an eerie shape.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2233"><span class="indent"><span>It wasn’t as though Shinji really wanted to complain. He wasn’t jealous seeing how happy Mark was, either. After all, neither Shinji nor </span><span data-term="Xin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> could handle weapons as large as this bardiche.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2234"><span class="indent"><span>“It’s just that, you know,” Shinji fumbled for the right words, “if a country can casually give away weapons of this caliber, it’s quite likely that this country is also more dangerous than we imagined…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2235"><span class="indent"><span>Mark and </span><span data-term="Xin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> fell silent. In fact, the two of them felt the same way. Mark was worried that the receptionist would take away his bardiche shortly after he got it. The rules stated that all items obtained in the labyrinth belonged to the challengers. Despite this, he figured a country would normally confiscate such a weapon, especially since it was this powerful.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2236"><span class="indent"><span>If that happened, Mark and the others would have no choice but to comply. As long as they were dependent on the country, they were forced to follow its directives and decisions. That was a rule common to every country. They were spies first and foremost, so stirring any kind of trouble would come to bite them twice as hard.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2237"><span class="indent"><span>But what ended up happening was a complete 180 from what they expected. They were met with cheers and applause from the staff, who even handed them extra prize money.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2238"><span class="indent"><span>By now they’d seen enough to believe that Tempest was unlike any other country.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2239"><span class="indent"><span>“The weapons are one thing,” Shinji muttered, “but the whole country really is bizarre, isn’t it?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2240"><span class="indent"><span>“It’s quite unexpected,” Mark echoed. “I think we’d make more money </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>and</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;have more fun if we took conquering the labyrinth more seriously. I mean, we’ve nothing to lose, right? If you’re weak, you’ll barely make ends meet, but if you’re strong, like we are—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2241"><span class="indent"><span>“Mark, stop. You remember what turncoats get, right?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2242"><span class="indent"><span>“…A death sentence.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2243"><span class="indent"><span>“—Yeah, I know that,” Mark replied, exasperated. “But for what it’s worth, life here seems more enjoyable.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2244"><span class="indent"><span>That was one thing they could all agree on.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2245"><span class="indent"><span>However, reality was harsh. Mark’s words were tempting, but this wasn’t the time nor place to be daydreaming.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2246"><span class="indent"><span>“If the war starts, this country will probably suffer a lot.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2247"><span class="indent"><span>“—Yeah. If this country wins, we could happily defect, but if we desert the Empire now, none of the countries will accept us.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2248"><span class="indent"><span>“…We can’t afford living without a country.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2249"><span class="indent"><span>They sighed and abandoned their naive thoughts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2250"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2251"><span class="indent"><span>Changing gears, they started contemplating their strategy for the following day’s conquest.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2252"><span class="indent"><span>“Tomorrow,” Shinji started, “we will head to the 51st floor.

Currently, intelligence agents dispatched by </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and </span><span data-term="Moss" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were waiting at key locations in the Great Jura Forest. Not only that, they were stationed all along the coast from the Kingdom of </span><span data-term="Farmenas" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> to the northern part of </span><span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, and even at the tops of the mountains.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2285"><span class="indent"><span>Despite this, I was still uneasy about our intelligence gathering. Latency was my biggest fear here.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2286"><span class="indent"><span>Although the agents were stationed in pairs, there was a chance that both of them could be killed at the same time. If that happened, then the intel from that zone would be completely cut off.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2287"><span class="indent"><span>The death of the agents was one thing, but the inherent delay caused by that could threaten the survival of a nation. In order to prevent such circumstances, I had strongly warned </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> to exercise extreme caution.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2288"><span class="indent"><span>In the event that one of these agents were uncovered, while they might not get killed, it would still lead to confrontation and combat. That would naturally mean a delay in the transmission of intel. And that was what I was trying to eliminate, along with making this network robust and secure.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2289"><span class="indent"><span>In order to achieve this, I thought of using magic as a surveillance tool. There was this long-range observation magic that existed in the sorcery system, but it wasn’t nearly as useful as I’d hoped. All it could do, at best, was confirm the shape of the object, which meant that the information it could provide was trivial. It could only monitor a particular place and required re-casting it to change to another place. It was terribly cumbersome magic, since switching locations took time, and if your target already left the area by the time you switched, it was a complete waste.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2290"><span class="indent"><span>Plus, if the target had put up a magic barrier, your magic would bounce off of it. This made it impossible to monitor powerful beings, and I concluded that it would be useless in an actual battle.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2291"><span class="indent"><span>But then I had a bright idea. The physical magic ‘Megiddo’ was a spell that converged sunlight into high-intensity beams using lenses formed by collecting water droplets in the air. I thought that the same theory could be applied to create a surveillance spell.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2292"><span class="indent"><span>For instance, suspending water drops in various locations to project a live image feed of those places. If that information could be transcribed, then it would allow us to monitor locations from far away. And if that wasn’t possible, then I would use the lenses I made on high-altitudes to magnify the feed and project it onto a monitor.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2293"><span class="indent"><span>Take telephoto lenses, images, and a mechanism to transcribe information. To put it simply, I would create magical surveillance satellites by combining these three.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2294"><span class="indent"><span>Although it seemed difficult to construct each concept with magic at first, </span><span data-term="Raphael" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san answered that it was possible using ‘physical magic,’ ‘spirit magic,’ and ‘Spatial Domination.’</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2295"><span class="indent"><span>Now all I had to do was to send detailed requests to </span><span data-term="Raphael" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san. Just like that, my improved magic concept had been created.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2296"><span class="indent"><span>Once this surveillance system was in place, it would be easier to safely gather reliable information. The potential amount of information that would be obtained was enormous, and no matter how the enemies moved, it’d be a piece of cake to find out what they were up to.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2297"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2298"><span class="indent"><span>You might be thinking I was just playing around during these hectic days, but this was super important.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2299"><span class="indent"><span>He who controls the information controls the world, and thus, wars as well.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2300"><span class="indent"><span>During the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed the Russian Baltic Fleet under the command of Togo Heihachiro, the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2301"><span class="indent"><span>It was said that the most important issue faced by the Japanese Navy in this battle was whether or not they could actually encounter the enemy fleets.

If our forces were deployed in various locations, there would be a high possibility that we, who were disadvantaged in terms of numbers, would lose.

Fighters with simplistic attack habits were initially left in the dust, but as time went on, they honed their skills and obtained better equipment. Eventually, they could hold their own, too.

Many people’s weapons were corroded by it and they would often come crying to our stores.

Our store policy “You break it, you buy it” was another way to make good money—all thanks to the tempest serpent!</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2324"><span class="indent"><span>The serpent roughed up the challengers and stripped them of their hard-earned gear.

The concept of fatigue likely didn’t apply to them; they had that unlimited “child energy.” As long as they were doing something they were interested in, they could keep going all day.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2351"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2352"><span class="indent"><span>“Ah! Commander, you’re here!” Ramiris exclaimed. “The situation remains unchanged for now!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2353"><span class="indent"><span>I didn’t know what was going on to begin with. She was probably just saying whatever fit the mood.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2354"><span class="indent"><span>I then turned my eyes towards the video shown on the huge screen. It displayed three youngsters. It appeared as though they were conquering one floor after another at break-neck speed, and their fighting style was quite distinctive.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2355"><span class="indent"><span>One man moved his arms through the air as if he were throwing something, and it apparently had some significant power behind it. Was this like a compressed air bullet? It sure wasn’t possible with mere “human strength.” He was a tall man of stout build, with brown hair. He had a chiseled face and stood out among them wearing his jeans and tank top. Yep, jeans and a tank top. That alone convinced me we had an otherworlder on our hands.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2356"><span class="indent"><span>Let me take a look at the other two.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2357"><span class="indent"><span>There was a short and skinny man clad in a black robe and another was a young man wearing a white coat over chain mail.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2358"><span class="indent"><span>White coat. Yeah, a white coat. The conventional type you’d see in labs and hospitals. However, in </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>this</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;world it wasn’t exactly “conventional.” That guy’s face looked distinctly East Asian, and undoubtedly Japanese.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2359"><span class="indent"><span>Apart from the black-robed man, I thought the tank top guy and lab coat guy were both otherworlders.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2360"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2361"><span class="indent"><span>Anyway, looking at the huge screen, I could see that they were still fighting. This time they were up against a big group—six death wolves had joined the fray and were assaulting the trio. The death wolves quickly closed the distance at a speed that ordinary humans couldn’t react to. They were obviously smart enough to realize that they had to get in close if they wanted to stand a chance. Beyond the 50th floor, even the riff raff had moderately high intelligence.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2362"><span class="indent"><span>By the way, a single death wolf was ranked B-plus, so if six of them were in a pack, things could get ugly fast. Moreover, since it was a dead spirit, it had the characteristic of being immune to physical attacks, unless they were from a holy weapon or a magic weapon.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2363"><span class="indent"><span>Because their bodies were constructed of magicules, they could regenerate them immediately, even if they were splattered to bits.

Hiyaaa!” roared the brown-haired guy who had previously been throwing air.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2366"><span class="indent"><span>This time, he was charging with the terrifying bardiche held high, and brought it down in a wide arc. With a deafening thud, three death wolves turned into light particles and disappeared.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2367"><span class="indent"><span>Oh, that’s it! No wonder the terrifying ax looked familiar—it was Minos’s Bardiche.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2368"><span class="indent"><span>When it came to unique-grade weapons, they, needless to say, had magical powers. In other words, it was a kind of magic weapon, and even the dead spirits could be damaged. The weapon’s magical power alone was enough to wound a </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2369"><span class="indent"><span>More to the point, Minos’s Bardiche was forged out of a very special alloy. As I recall, it was made from mithril, which was a custom alloy combining silver with magisteel. It was a holy-type weapon, which inflicted extra damage to dead spirits and the undead.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2370"><span class="indent"><span>“Aah,” I muttered, “with Minos’s Bardiche, the death wolves are dead meat.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2371"><span class="indent"><span>“Yeah, that weapon was the one dropped by </span><span data-term="Gozer" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>,” Veldora pointed out. “This guy here seems to be a pretty sharp fighter, swinging that ax like he’s practiced for years with it.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2372"><span class="indent"><span>As we stood there watching their fight, they filled me in on what happened until today.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2373"><span class="indent"><span>I had a sudden craving for potato chips right about now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2374"><span class="indent"><span>By the sound of things, the brown-haired guy had been the one taking out all of the </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

Floor 51 was where the most insidious, meanest traps started coming into play, which could kill you on the spot. As I watched, the black-robed guy pointed at the exact places where the traps were hidden.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2377"><span class="indent"><span>That was his Unique Skill.

Not because he hung back most of the time, but because he was playing the role of their commander.

So, it was simply absurd to take anything written on this paper at face value.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2399"><span class="indent"><span>The jobs that they had written here were also very fishy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2400"><span class="indent"><span>Being a magician was a high-class career that entailed mastery over two or more types of magic. In </span><span data-term="Shinjee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s case in particular, he had apparently learned both spirit magic and elemental magic. The guy did have noteworthy talent.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2401"><span class="indent"><span>The same applied to warriors, who must master weaponry and hand-to-hand combat skills. In this case, proficiency in at least one basic martial art and weapon class was to be expected.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2402"><span class="indent"><span>There were several weapon categories to choose from, ranging from sword fighting, archery, and in some cases, throwing arts, which included knife throwing and stone throwing. You just had to pick the one that suited you best. The essence of the art of weaponry was the path towards mastering that weapon of choice.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2403"><span class="indent"><span>In the case of Mark, he was evidently good at hand-to-hand combat, throwing, and fighting with a spear—a jack-of-all-trades.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2404"><span class="indent"><span>Lastly, hunters were said to be the cream of the crop among those who dispatched </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. You had to master the type of archery that specialized in using the traditional bow and ‘Formhide,’ an Art that was very difficult to handle. Furthermore, you had to master the ‘Danger Detection’ Skill, and thus talent alone was not enough to get a job as a hunter. It was the most reliable occupation among the members of subjugation guilds.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2405"><span class="indent"><span>In this world, hardly anyone had the abilities to discover traps and </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, which were skills essential for exploration. As such, people who could be hunters were very few, to the point that they were only born from tribes that specialized in hunting. So that made the career harder to achieve.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2406"><span class="indent"><span>Those three with rather rare jobs had arrived as a party.

There was no doubt that the trio could keep everything except what they had to submit as part of their mission.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2862"><span class="indent"><span>“But, you know, if they’re going to take away all the money we earned, we’ll seriously consider immigrating here, right?” Shinji suggested, and they both readily agreed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2863"><span class="indent"><span>One gold coin equaled 100,000 yen. This held true in the Empire as well. The gold coins made in the Dwarven Kingdom were in circulation far and wide, and even the Empire recognized them as legal tender. Since the coins they had earned were the same, they could still use them back home.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2864"><span class="indent"><span>“I seriously think we should do that.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2865"><span class="indent"><span>“…Yeah. I was joking earlier, but if we try our best, we are pretty sure to have a better life here.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2866"><span class="indent"><span>Shinji was half serious about that, but Mark and </span><span data-term="Xin" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were way more interested than he thought.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2867"><span class="indent"><span>It was true that the Empire was the hub of cutting-edge technology and fostered a prosperous culture—the capital was especially advanced. The food was tasty, and the living standards were high. As long as they had the money, they could live as happily as they did in their previous world.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2868"><span class="indent"><span>However, the trio were active soldiers in the army, so it wasn’t an understatement to say that death was waiting for them around every corner. In that respect, the Dungeon was a blessing for them. After all, death would never catch them there. They were skeptical at first, but after experiencing it for themselves and getting resurrected, their doubts were instantly erased. If they didn’t have to worry about dying, then they could earn as much money as possible and live every day to its fullest. It was quite reasonable for Shinji and the others to think this was the better choice.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2869"><span class="indent"><span>But even if you had enough money, it would be useless if there wasn’t any entertainment to spend it on.

On such days, the citizens were free to hang out and play there. Sports like football, baseball, and various others were popular and commonly played in Tempest, so those who challenged the labyrinth also had a great time. There were hot springs and opera houses as well. Plays were also staged, which—as they found out during their investigations—were packed every day.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2871"><span class="indent"><span>The trio found that the food was just as good—if not better—as the Empire’s. The Japanese flavor that Shinji missed dearly, plenty of sweets, and a wide variety of liquors. Even the dishes that didn’t exist in this world had been recreated here. As someone from Earth, Shinji’s heart was truly enamored of this city.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2872"><span class="indent"><span>Frankly, they were obliged only to </span><span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, and it seemed like </span><span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> himself didn’t want to be hostile to </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

There was no doubt a war was about to start, and this land would be directly subjected to its ravages. If it weren’t for that, they would have already chosen to immigrate here.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2879"><span class="indent"><span>“Which side do you think will win?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2880"><span class="indent"><span>“…Rather, if we were ordered to attack this city, what would we do?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2881"><span class="indent"><span>The three exchanged looks with one another.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2882"><span class="indent"><span>The food, which they found so tasty before, suddenly lost all its flavor. There were two reasons why they couldn’t do such a thing. They had only stayed in the city for a short period of time, but it had already grown on them. The thought that this city would vanish disheartened them. There was another reason, too…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2883"><span class="indent"><span>Considering the strength of the boss in that labyrinth, it wasn’t hard for them to believe that the powerful people in this country had incredible abilities.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2884"><span class="indent"><span>“Normally, I’d think it’s only natural for the guardians who protect important facilities to be strong, wouldn’t it? But is this country’s army </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>really</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;weaker than the guardians of the Empire? That borders on wishful thinking,” Shinji reasoned.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2885"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s what I think as well. </span><span data-term="Demon Lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> himself must be on another level,” Mark murmured in agreement. “A long time ago, that evil dragon Veldora annihilated an entire city, and that story doesn’t seem to be a joke.

The reason why the corps members could not coordinate well with others was because of the fact that each and every one of them possessed extraordinary abilities. So outstanding were their abilities, in fact, that managing those guys was difficult. Many of its members were otherworlders whose potential was completely unknown.

The magic tank, which was operated by five people, was an unprecedented war machine that revolutionized the understanding of battle. The main armament of the tanks, named magic gun, had an initial velocity of 2,000 meters per second. It had a 50-round capacity and could fire five rounds per minute. Its power was tremendous, being able to unleash destruction equivalent to tactical-class super-high explosive magic. Incidentally, although this was fired based on magic principles, the shell itself was a simple lump of iron.

It dawned on him that planning an attack through sheer numbers was too childish of a proposal. More importantly though, he had devised a plan against the </span><span data-term="Storm Dragon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. It was something he had carefully laid out over the years. He wasn’t afraid of Veldora. </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>At the end of the day, he’s still a dragon, right?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3323"><span class="indent"><span>Indeed, the dragons that nested in the Canaat Mountains were all strong </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. The lesser dragons that inhabited the foot of the mountains would be easy to handle, but those that had grown into fair dragons would have a strength of A rank or higher. And if they turned into archdragons with elemental attributes, they would become dangerous threats to a small country.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3324"><span class="indent"><span>In the case of the Empire, however, it was possible to defeat them by simply dispatching a battalion of about five hundred troops from the Augmented Legion. These soldiers had subjugated dragons several times in military exercises, and as long as they made no mistakes, they could handle the encounter without serious damage. That was testament to the greatness of the Empire. It was within their power as a nation to support tens of thousands of soldiers. Not even a horde of dragons could jeopardize the Empire’s military.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3325"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Calgurio" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> perceived Veldora as another type of dragon. Thus, he arrived at the conclusion: </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>What is there to fear from a single dragon?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3326"><span class="indent"><span>The strength of a </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was determined by the amount of magicules it possessed, and that held true no matter how powerful it was. Dragons were strong because they had enormous magicule reserves in proportion to their mass. High defenses and breath attacks that could exterminate large areas—they possessed such powerful abilities thanks to their overwhelming magicule capacity.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3327"><span class="indent"><span>Taking that to be the case, there was no need to fight them head-on.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3328"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Calgurio" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and his men had a secret plan. The magic canceler—a new top-secret technology they were developing. Using magic to weaken a dragon wasn’t a sure-fire success. Depending on the dragon, such an attempt could be nullified by its ‘Magic Interference.’ But all of that became moot with the introduction of this new technology. The radiation emitted from a magic canceler directly affected the substance called magicules. It could not manipulate the magicules in a directed manner, but instead made these particles’ behavior erratic. In other words, it had the effect of making magicules go haywire.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3329"><span class="indent"><span>When used against a mage, it would inhibit the ability to chant, and by extension, the ability to cast magic. When used against a </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, it would disrupt the magicules that made up its body, restraining the ability to act. In short, it weakened their bodies. A successful attack would render a </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> totally disabled. This would be especially effective against a dense mass of magicules like Veldora. </span><span data-term="Calgurio" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> had built his confidence upon this belief.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3330"><span class="indent"><span>The second ace up their sleeve was the magic tank. Its magic gun packed a serious punch, able to fell a huge magic beast with a single shot. Experiments performed on dragons they captured showed that even those ranked A could be killed in one hit.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3331"><span class="indent"><span>Next up are their treasured airships. The secret weapons described as the culmination of magical technology. Able to reach top speeds exceeding Mach 1, they were impossible to outrun for any flesh and blood creature.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3332"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Calgurio" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> devised a strategy against Veldora as follows:</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3333"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3334"><span class="indent"><span>Fast-moving soldiers would lure out Veldora and pin him down by activating the magic cancelers placed in the forest. As a follow-up, the airships would then focus the rays of their magic cancelers on Veldora to immobilize him completely. And then, for the finishing blow: volley fire from the magic guns mounted on 2,000 magic tanks. With this, surely, even that ancient, evil dragon would meet its demise.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3335"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3336"><span class="italic indent"><span>Let’s say it </span></span><span class="strong italic indent"><span>did</span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>&nbsp;survive… No matter how strong these True Dragons are, there is no way it could make it out unscathed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3337"><span class="indent"><span>Gathering intelligence was key to increasing your odds during a battle.

They wouldn’t publicly declare war against another country, though. To them, their emperor was the absolute authority, so they didn’t acknowledge the existence of other countries.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3837"><span class="indent"><span>However, that was just a facade.

At worst, they would justify the slaughter of civilians. That meant that if we were to lose the war to the Empire, we would lose everything.

Why do they have tanks!” I called out, unable to believe my eyes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3881"><span class="indent"><span>I hurriedly asked Shinji and the others and found out that the Empire was pushing for the development of modern weapons using the otherworlders’ knowledge—science and technology.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3882"><span class="indent"><span>Instead of gas, it had an internal-combustion engine running on magicules. These were supplied by the constant intake of outside air, which had the added benefit of not only harvesting magicules from the environment, but also served to cool the hot engine.

The idea of a tank in this world of knights never occurred to me. We had built a train, meaning we were </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>this</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;close to making tanks, too…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3886"><span class="indent"><span>—But we didn’t have cars, either, so skipping straight to tanks would’ve been weird. I always thought that it would be a shame to popularize the use of cars, too. They were convenient, but equally dangerous, you know what I mean? Everyone would clamor to get one, but in the end, it would be impossible to ever meet demand. Resource scarcity was still a thing here, so the split between haves and have-nots was inevitable.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3887"><span class="indent"><span>In my opinion, using trains in urban environments was more convenient than cars.

They were meant to be something people could strive for, as the ultimate status symbol.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3888"><span class="indent"><span>Well, that would have to wait until after the war. After all, their tanks weren’t the only thing of note.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3889"><span class="indent"><span>They also had ships that flew in the sky. </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>Are you for real?!</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;I wanted to shout. Having that kind of thing would make transportation a piece of cake. They could single-handedly solve logistics problems when used for war.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3890"><span class="indent"><span>At that point, I realized that maybe I was getting too cocky. Perhaps I was being a bit optimistic when I assumed our air superiority. I had thought about developing that sort of thing as well, but dismissed it as impossible. One does not simply develop flying ships overnight.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3891"><span class="indent"><span>Given enough time, we maybe could’ve done it, but development wasn’t </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>that </span></span><span class="indent"><span>straight-forward. It takes a lot of trial and error before a product is ready for practical use. So, we had to applaud the research and development team of the Empire; those guys were brilliant. But I must admit that I had a slight desire to capture at least one ship whole.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3892"><span class="indent"><span>Had I tried to think more outside-the-box and been a tad more liberal in my demands, we could’ve been sitting here with our very own—you know what?

The threat of the Western Nations has been drastically reduced.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4157"><span class="indent"><span>“That is indeed the case. Those who dared to stand in my way have met their demise entirely on their own.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4158"><span class="indent"><span>Both of them firmly believed that this had to be a divine revelation preceding Rudra’s domination of the world.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4159"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4160"><span class="indent"><span>“By the way, Rudra, how are you doing?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4161"><span class="indent"><span>“Perfectly fine. My power—’Army of Angels, Armageddon’—can be activated at any time.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4162"><span class="indent"><span>‘Armageddon’ was Rudra’s ultimate trump card. The conditions for its activation were very strict, and once it was triggered, there would be a long wait before this Skill could be called upon once more.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4163"><span class="indent"><span>There was only one reason why the Empire had stayed put until now—they had been waiting resolutely for the day that Rudra could unleash ‘Armageddon’ again. Now with the threat of </span><span data-term="Granbell" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> out of the picture, needless to say, Rudra believed that they would be victorious.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4164"><span class="indent"><span>As for </span><span data-term="Guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, he still had not been able to control the </span><span data-term="demon" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> lords completely.

Each of them possessed great influence individually, but they were no threats in Rudra’s eyes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4165"><span class="indent"><span>“This time, everything is stacked in our favor.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4166"><span class="indent"><span>“But do we have enough time?

That way we can use him to deal with </span><span data-term="Guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

That brings me to my next question: How is your power of ‘Domination’?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4167"><span class="indent"><span>“Rest assured. If you could keep Veldora occupied on the battlefield, I can use ‘Regalia Dominion’ to achieve complete control over him.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4168"><span class="indent"><span>A gentle smile emerged on Velgrynd’s cruel yet beautiful face upon hearing this.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4169"><span class="indent"><span>“Ara, then victory is all but guaranteed.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4170"><span class="indent"><span>“Naturally. Everything is going just as I planned.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4171"><span class="indent"><span>“Wonderful, though I am rather worried about you—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4172"><span class="indent"><span>“Oh, stop that,” he chided. “This is the natural order of things. The human body is truly inconvenient…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4173"><span class="indent"><span>“Rudra…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4174"><span class="indent"><span>“Successively inheriting my will and memories each time I reincarnate has taken its toll on my ‘soul.’ It would be fine if I had some time to rest like </span><span data-term="Gadra" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, but that is a forbidden luxury for me. If I were to do that, my ‘power’ would be sealed again.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4175"><span class="indent"><span>That way, Rudra would have to start over if he wished to unleash his power. If he were to do that during every reincarnation, he would have no chance against </span><span data-term="Guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. That was why he had been waiting for his power to mature this whole time. Now that he felt his power reaching full strength, the stage was set.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4176"><span class="indent"><span>Despite everything, Rudra was pushing himself quite a bit in order to maintain this state. Not only did this incarnation of him have no empress, he did not even have a concubine. Even though the supposed empress of the Empire was nothing but a title, this was highly abnormal. This meant that no imperial heir was born as a spare for Rudra. Having one wouldn’t separate his power. His incarnations were very special; the heir he brought forth would inherit all his power and knowledge. It was the purest form of hereditary monarchy—in a sense, it wasn’t an heir at all. The imperial heir could be said to be the emperor himself.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4177"><span class="indent"><span>However, he did not do this during the present incarnation. It had to do with the use of ‘Armageddon.’ If the imperial heir were to inherit his power, his Skills would be limited until he matured to adulthood. Obtaining immense power came with repercussions, and he wouldn’t be able to contain it. Even Rudra couldn’t hold up against it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4178"><span class="indent"><span>Yet, right now, this was the best situation they’d chanced upon. All the stars had aligned, and to forfeit the opportunity, solely to reincarnate as the prince would waste yet another decade.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4179"><span class="indent"><span>Rudra did not want that. But this greatly worried Velgrynd. Maintaining his full strength seemed to push Rudra’s mind to its limit. The duration of his sleep had been shortening and he was often exhausted. Under these circumstances, Rudra’s soul was wearing away rapidly. If he gave his power to the heir, it would delay the activation of ‘Armageddon,’ but it would also ease his symptoms. Yet still, he adamantly refused.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4180"><span class="indent"><span>This was his time. He wanted to settle his game against </span><span data-term="Guy" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> once and for all.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4181"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4182"><span class="indent"><span>Velgrynd could not bear to see Rudra like this.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4183"><span class="indent"><span>“How much time do you have left, Rudra—?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4184"><span class="indent"><span>“You don’t have to worry. At the very least, I can guarantee you that I will not fall before I conquer this world.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4185"><span class="indent"><span>“I-I see. I should have expected that, from you of all people…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4186"><span class="indent"><span>“Don’t be so sad, Velgrynd. When I achieve victory, I shall end this all. Have faith. Simply observe how I dominate this world,” Rudra said with an arrogant smile.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4187"><span class="indent"><span>He was the embodiment of a ruler in every sense of the word.
