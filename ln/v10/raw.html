What&rsquo;s the issue?&rdquo; asked the man with the asymmetric mask. It was Laplace, the majin of the Moderate Clown Troupe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was a trusted companion of this young man&mdash;Yuuki Kagurazaka.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4 c8">an issue</span><span class="c1">. Since I was invited, I went along to pay a visit. And as it turns out, our opponent is so incredibly strong that I&rsquo;ve lost confidence in myself. I think it&rsquo;s time to re-examine our plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you say we need to re-examine our plan?&rdquo; Ex-Demon Lord Kazaream, in disguise as a secretary&mdash;Kagali&mdash;questioned back. To that, Yuuki responded with another sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s about that slime. It turns out that it&rsquo;s best that we avoid antagonizing him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, shouldn&rsquo;t you just keep him close? I planned to explore the ruins as well, so isn&rsquo;t it for the best that we maintain friendly terms anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, we will still go according to our plan. It&rsquo;s just going to be harder, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why? Surely there won&rsquo;t be any conflict if we tread carefully.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was no fool. Even though he bore a grudge after his companion Clayman was killed, he wasn&rsquo;t going to go against his boss&mdash;Yuuki&rsquo;s commands&mdash;and pick a fight with Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t just Laplace&rsquo;s sentiment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman, Tear, and even the chairman of the Clown Troupe, Kagali, thought the same. Even they knew the danger of acting on impulse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth of this world was that it was the survival of the fittest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, these experiences had taught Laplace and the others that if they didn&rsquo;t have a one hundred percent chance of winning, forcing their plan would only result in failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Far from wreaking vengeance on Demon Lord Leon, Clayman was now dead. Kazaream already put so much effort into </span><span class="c4">resurrecting with the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;identity of Kagali, but now, it seemed like they were back at square one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, if they really were to take on Demon Lord Rimuru, they would have no time to take their revenge on Demon Lord Leon. It was for this reason &nbsp;that the clowns decided to obey Yuuki&rsquo;s orders and be cautious.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet Yuuki now claimed that there was a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but that also seems to have gotten harder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think that slime is onto me&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? Did you do something to get yourself caught?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! This is the Boss we are talking here, not you, Laplace!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh heh, that&rsquo;s right, Laplace. As far as I can tell, there&rsquo;s no one more careful than Boss. There&rsquo;s no way that Boss would slip up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki, who had always been cautious, admitted his misstep.. When Laplace retorted in surprise, Tear and Footman reacted as if they denied it. That was how much Yuuki had won the trust of the clowns. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali, head of the Troupe, then scolded the clowns, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get riled up now. Rather than saying that it was Yuuki-sama&rsquo;s misstep, it was more due to that slime&rsquo;s intricate mind games. I confronted it with Yuuki and found that that slime was really something else. I felt as though I was being surveilled from start to finish. It really got on my nerves. Although I&rsquo;ve yet to see through its true ability yet, I could already tell that this was no easy opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having faced it herself, Kagali knew that slime was dangerous. Although she didn&rsquo;t feel it was as strong as Leon, its eyes that seemingly could see through anything, made her feel greatly threatened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki agreed with Kagali, &ldquo;Ahh, seriously, that slime&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;was really something else. During the festival, the key figures within the council that sponsored us, were there too. Those people didn&rsquo;t know how to tackle the slime and ended up looking awfully pitiful. Our opponent was cunning and merciless. Despite his normally kind and generous demeanor, once he gets pissed off, he becomes a force to be reckoned with. Our plan of manipulating him didn&rsquo;t work out. Surely, he will be on his guard from now on,&rdquo; he shrugged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Boss, no matter how much he&rsquo;s on the lookout, he doesn&rsquo;t have any evidence, right? If that&rsquo;s the case, as long as we act without raising any suspicion, won&rsquo;t they struggle to make another move?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, I didn&rsquo;t leave any physical evidence, but I was the one who leaked the information about Shizu-san to Hinata. I think that should be sufficient evidence. In fact, on the last day, when he gathered everyone connected to him and discussed plans for the future, everyone gathered there seemed to be Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;Rimuru-san&rsquo;s suspects. I was definitely found out there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How could that be&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gang went silent as they listened to Yuuki&rsquo;s explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never mind. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time, anyway. That slime really poses a threat to us. Then, Boss, how will we adjust the plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Of course she&rsquo;s the one to ask. </span><span class="c1">The first one to bounce back from the shock was Kagali. She had seen plenty of turmoil during her time as demon lord, so naturally, she was back on her feet just as fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm. Let&rsquo;s first proceed just as before: keep ourselves in the shadows peacefully. Since Demon Lord Rimuru doesn&rsquo;t have concrete evidence, he won&rsquo;t be openly hostile towards us. Despite his casual looks, he&rsquo;s constantly calculating his losses and gains.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s why he mentioned the ancient ruins directly in front of us. He was probably trying to see our reaction. If we had planned something against him, he&rsquo;d ruthlessly retaliate&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My thoughts exactly. Humans are unpredictable creatures. There&rsquo;s a saying that goes, &lsquo;Today&#39;s enemies could be tomorrow&rsquo;s friends.&rsquo; Unless things change drastically, there&rsquo;s no need for us to antagonize him. As long as we can change his mind to favor our side, we would be home free.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki glanced around to observe everyone&rsquo;s reaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, we&rsquo;re supposed to continue to cooperate with them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult to control them by force, but since the Boss has spoken, we shall do as ordered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Footman, you big idiot, it&rsquo;s because we </span><span class="c4 c8">can&rsquo;t </span><span class="c1">take them by force that we have been working so hard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, don&rsquo;t get so worked up about it. Footman has a point too. It&rsquo;d piss anyone off to have been looked down upon by some newcomer. But even if we win by working together, they still have the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s no need to gamble our own forces for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yeah. We shouldn&rsquo;t dwell on it too much. Just </span><span class="c4">follow </span><span class="c1">Boss and Chairman&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys, I told you all to follow orders from the start! I don&rsquo;t object to their views at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The trio looked a bit upset, but they weren&rsquo;t objecting to the plan. Having confirmed so, Yuuki and Kagali exchanged looks and nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Western Saints Church had the Holy Nation Ruberios to back it up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the top of the chain of command for the Freedom Association was the Western State Council, its power was controlled entirely by the Rosso family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These two forces had been the main hindrances on their road to dominating the Western Nations. And now there was one more: the Demon Lord Rimuru who established the Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Yuuki witnessing the nation founding festival himself this time, he realized how stupid it would be to try and oppose Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I was worried that these guys would do their own thing if I were to announce that we won&rsquo;t go against Rimuru-san again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Yuuki had been doubtful of it, it seemed that he had simply been worrying too much. It might have been different in the past, but Kagali had learnt to calmly keep her composure after she lost to Leon in the past. She had endured for a long time, with the clowns trying to help fulfill her ambition. It would seem that these companions that Yuuki trusted were no fools. They wouldn&rsquo;t act recklessly without careful consideration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How reliable you all are. Then I&rsquo;ll have you guys handle the job that Damrada has been doing,&rdquo; Yuuki said cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on&hellip; Are you referring to the top-secret merchandise?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Are you really handing it to us&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, is that really wise, Boss?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The clowns&rsquo; expressions changed drastically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s cheerful smile didn&rsquo;t fade one bit as he looked at them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Surely it wouldn&rsquo;t pose an issue to you guys right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just count on us! You must be worried about us doing something reckless, no? No way, no way, I swear I&rsquo;m not gonna strike even if I think I can win!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right! Clayman forgot to act cautiously in the end&hellip; If we were to make the same mistake as he did, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to mock that guy in hell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a point. Reckless acts would only end in failure. As the Angry Pierrot, I must keep that idea close to heart. Even though I swore to take revenge on Demon Lord Leon one day, it&rsquo;s still too early to act on that yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All three gave their own views as they promised, and Yuuki smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys have matured more than I expected,&rdquo; he murmured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then that he recalled something that had been bothering him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, I just recalled&hellip;when you mentioned top-secret merchandise&hellip; Demon Lord Rimuru took away the kids that were under my care, yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, because of Shizue Izawa&rsquo;s involvement, we couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it afterward&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He even used the festival as an excuse. Now that I think about it, he definitely suspected me back then. Never mind, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m more concerned about what Demon Lord Rimuru said.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki explained his thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The children had grown stronger, most likely due to Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s meddling.. Rimuru refused to talk openly about what happened, but he had accidentally blurted out that &ldquo;The kids need to deepen their understanding of the spirits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He has more or less obfuscated all the questions that I raised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably because the kids have grown so strong that he didn&rsquo;t think it was possible to keep it a secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who knows? Maybe he&rsquo;s doing this strategically, which is getting on my nerves. However, he must have used the spirits to neutralize the magicules in their bodies,&rdquo; Yuuki shrugged as he finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Demon Lord Rimuru is not an opponent to be underestimated</span><span class="c4 c8">,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yuuki</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;thought to himself. It wouldn&rsquo;t be far-fetched to think he had some scheme behind this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That makes sense,&rdquo; Kagali agreed with him. &ldquo;Now that you mentioned it, wasn&rsquo;t Shizue Izawa also a Spirit Wielder of a Greater Fire Spirit? In other words, &lsquo;Incomplete Summoned Ones&rsquo; who were summoned with flaws can be reused by using spirits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Kagali&rsquo;s deduction, Laplace and the others also seemed to realize something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see how it is. Could this be Demon Lord Leon&rsquo;s true goal? He seemed to be gathering &lsquo;Otherworlders&rsquo; who had failed summonings. Has Leon been collecting them so as to train them into soldiers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh&mdash;I remember! Isn&rsquo;t Ifrit the Flame Giant one of Leon&rsquo;s subordinates? Clayman has ordered his men to attack Leon several times, but they were all taken out by the Flame Giant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, is he perhaps planning to expand his crew of Spirit Wielders such as Shizue Izawa? In that case, it might be unwise to hand over the top-secret merchandise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The clowns expressed their views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Footman had a point, as Yuuki felt the same. But there was still one thing that was confusing to him. The so-called &lsquo;Top-secret Merchandise&rsquo; was, in truth, just children who had been summoned imperfectly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, there were still places conducting countless flawed summonings. They had managed to deceive Shizue Izawa as well as the entire Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more they conducted these summonings, the more failures they got. The one who was buying these failed summons was Damrada of the secret organization &lsquo;Cerberus&rsquo;. Since the truth about these children couldn&rsquo;t go public, he had been collecting them for personal usage in the name of research.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was just a ruse; he had other plans in mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was, in fact, at the request of Demon Lord Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was looking for &ldquo;Otherworld children under the age of ten.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Uh&mdash;did Leon do it to expand his arsenal? I suppose that makes some sense, but why couldn&rsquo;t he have just done it himself&hellip;? He must have something else in mind to have intentionally leaked the most advanced theories of summoning to the Eastern Empire and the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Yuuki couldn&rsquo;t reach a solid conclusion. Thus, he didn&rsquo;t have room to act</span><span class="c4 c8">&mdash;</span><span class="c1">having still been bound by his contract with Demon Lord Leon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki made up his mind as he gave his order to the three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then I will have you three discuss the matter with Demon Lord Leon. Whether his plan is to increase his martial prowess or otherwise, you must be thorough with your investigation of the matter. Misha will be negotiating </span><span class="c4">with the Rosso</span><span class="c1">. Take the goods from her and proceed with the plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, just count on me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um um! I will do my best!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, yes sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The trio looked highly motivated as Kagali gave a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t work too hard and get yourself exposed in front of Demon Lord Leon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, heed me now, you guys really need to be more careful. We can&rsquo;t afford right now to antagonize Demon Lord Leon as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three acknowledged Yuuki&rsquo;s warning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace professed that the three of them were not idiots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki decided to put his faith in his trusted companions before continuing to explain the engagement plan in detail.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After ordering Laplace and the other clowns, it was time for Kagali&rsquo;s order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to Yuuki and asked in a serious tone, &ldquo;Boss, what should I do then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was inquiring about the investigation of the ruins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it was called a ruin, that really wasn&rsquo;t the case, especially to the likes of Kagali. To them, it was a familiar city. When she was still Demon Lord Kazaream, she used to apply magic as a defense mechanism for the city. That was the true identity of the ancient ruins of &lsquo;Amalita&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike the city on the surface protected by Adalman, &lsquo;Amalita&rsquo; was mainly guarded by Kazaream&rsquo;s spells and his numerous enchanted dolls. Clayman inherited Kazaream&rsquo;s technology, but even his finest work, the doll named Piorra, could only be considered as mid-to-high-end among the enchanted dolls that were guarding the ruins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To have such powerful defensive mechanisms within the ruins&mdash;in other words, this ruin named &lsquo;Amalita&rsquo; was the true form of the Puppet Kingdom Jistav.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to ask why these ruins named &lsquo;Amalita&rsquo; had such a high level of defense? The answer to that question could be traced back to ancient times.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the distant past, the Ultra-Sorcerer Kingdom of the elves was once prosperous, but it called upon its own destruction by its own stupidity. The nation angered a young girl who would come to be a demon lord&mdash;Milim, the daughter of the Dragon King. The kingdom was wiped out from the face of the earth overnight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rubble left in its wake was known as the ancient ruin &lsquo;Soma&rsquo;. Elves that managed to survive swore to restore the glory that Soma once held, yet they failed in their conquest. The depraved monster that they themselves created&mdash;the Chaos Dragon&mdash;wielded power beyond belief and drove these people away from their hometown. The power held by the Chaos Dragon was the equivalent of Calamity-class. Although it was not as strong as a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;, it still wasn&rsquo;t something the elves could tackle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The elven survivors went on to spread across the land and walked down different paths. Struck by the sudden misfortune, the elven people, ignorant of the event that took place, sought refuge from their elven ancestors. Those with power explored and settled in the wilderness before building new kingdoms. Some escaped in secret, became reclusive, and lived away from civilizations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of the sins of a few individuals, the golden age of elves came to an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some were cursed for their sins and became dark elves. In order to escape from Milim&rsquo;s fury, they went afar to explore a new land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali&mdash;Demon Lord Kazaream&mdash;was one of them. He managed to survive after witnessing the true power of Demon Lord Milim, and was among the few remaining members of the elven royal family. Kazaream was not a Demon Lord then. He escaped to this distant land and tried to rebuild a nation in the image of his hometown. He managed to preserve all the elven technology, so it hadn&rsquo;t been lost, and thus he proceeded to recreating physical copies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nation that was born as a result was the capital Amalita of the Puppet Kingdom Jistav.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Caught up in reminiscing about the past, Kagali tore herself away and shook her head to get her mind off the memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The defenses in Amalita have yet to be disarmed; should we set them up against Demon Lord Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">She had made a deal with Rimuru to explore the ancient ruins at Clayman&rsquo;s base together, during which she could use the opportunity to sabotage Rimuru with the traps. It would be a piece of cake for </span><span class="c4">Kagali</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, only Milim and Veldora would pose a threat. If it was just Rimuru by himself, wouldn&rsquo;t it be simple to take care of him?&mdash;Kagali thought to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By merely triggering the defense mechanism, she could also avoid raising suspicion. Based on these thoughts, Kagali gave her suggestion, but Yuuki rejected the idea without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would be quite interesting, but will it seriously work? Have you considered that Demon Lord Milim might tag along with him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, where there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way. He won&rsquo;t be suspicious if I only trigger the mechanisms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Kazaream&rsquo;s homeland was destroyed in the past&mdash;no, </span><span class="c4">Kagali&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">. Yuuki was worried that that might have traumatized her, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From elf to dark elf, then into undead elf, and finally a demon lord. Throughout all these experiences, Kagali managed to overcome all the trauma Milim brought her. But Kagali knew that she had no chance of beating Milim. She knew it would be a reckless act&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right! Then I&rsquo;ll be counting on you in that regard. It would be quite impossible to try and beat him. But I will be able to ascertain just how strong Demon Lord Rimuru really is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is our opponent really worth such effort?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes he is. So, Kagali, make sure you don&rsquo;t reveal your true identity. He must be suspecting me at this point, but he shouldn&rsquo;t be certain about your identity. Just act cautiously and don&rsquo;t let him provoke you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand, Boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki and Kagali smiled at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right! Then we&rsquo;ll be off to meet Misha.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep preparing. What do you plan to do next, Boss?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me? I was going to contact Damrada to have him expand our base of operations in the East. If anything happens, we can flee to them. But before that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? You are definitely plotting something! And you&rsquo;re telling us to hold back while you are out scheming yourself,&rdquo; Laplace grumbled as Yuuki gave a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case, Laplace. I&rsquo;m just planning to use every card I have. Because I&rsquo;m not giving up on dominating the West yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small smile emerged on the corner of Yuuki&rsquo;s lips.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The majins in the shadows were once again on the move.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Gonna"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.l6jyj3i27nuf"><span class="c4 c22">Chapter 1</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c26 c4">The Smooth Operation of the Labyrinth</span></p><hr><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c26 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Founding Festival of the Tempest Federation was a success, and with that the festival came to an end. It had been a busy ten days, and all the invited guests as well as visitors from the neighboring nations had all left the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That included the king of Blumund and Fuze, who both seemed to have something to discuss regarding their future plans and went home as soon as they could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dwarven King Gazel promised to elect a squad of researchers and also left pretty early.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the Emperor of Sarion, Elmesia, she bought some sort of inn near the guest hotel located in the prime district of town. She picked one of the rooms in it and set up a magic portal, apparently for the convenience of coming back for fun at any time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected from a billionaire. She really was lavish with her spending. No wonder why Gazel looked on with envy at her haughty attitude. If Gazel had that kinda cash, he could have also had the chance to purchase a resort in our nation. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve thanked Elmesia for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from that, some of our residents were already working in the inn. She was willing to hire them on the spot under the same conditions. Rigurd took care of the detailed arrangements involving chores such as providing her food and routinely cleaning her room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess next time I visit, I&rsquo;ll transfer my consciousness to a homunculus. It&rsquo;s a pity that I can&rsquo;t fully enjoy myself with that body&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your Majesty, please stop being so self-indulgent!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An example to counter her point this time was the fact that Elmesia herself leaving the nation had already caused Armageddon. Although this had nothing to do with us, Elalude must have been tormented beyond his breaking point. Even the mobilization of the bodyguards to protect Elmesia&mdash;the Magus&mdash;was considered a serious matter in terms of national defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so&hellip; then is Elen using a homunculus as well&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elen was Elalude&rsquo;s daughter, so she was of course also an elf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her ears however, looked human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, about that, Elen-chan is using her own body. Homunculi are not all-powerful. In fact, prolonged use of one puts the user at risk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;YOUR MAJESTY! Your nonchalant attitude leaking national secrets will cause huge problems!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From my private conversation with Elmesia, Elen seems to have been using drugs to alter her appearance and used her own body to travel. That was why Elalude was always worried and had sent many bodyguards in secret. Speaking of which, to my utter surprise, Cabal and Gido were both members of the Magus. Elalude was just shouting that dispatching even one of these knights would affect national defense, yet he was generous enough to send two by his daughter&rsquo;s side&hellip; Elalude sure cared a lot about his daughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But how come those two never looked that strong&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I ran &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; on the two in the past, they appeared to be quite weak. Therefore, I asked to clarify my doubts. Elalude, on the other hand, answered with quite a bit of restraint, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s top secret as well, but I&rsquo;ll let you in on it. Those two have equipped magic rings that limit their abilities. If Elen really were to fall into danger, the limit would then be removed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s what he said, so does that mean that Sarion&rsquo;s Sorcerer Technology is superior to my &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo;?&mdash;</span><span class="c4">I was quite surprised. But now that I thought about it, the accuracy of my &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; back then was vastly inferior to what I have now. Perhaps today I&rsquo;d be able to see through their hidden strength. It seemed that I couldn&rsquo;t let my guard down just because I had run an examination or two on a person.</span><span class="c4 c8">&nbsp;I really need to be more cautious from now on. Next time I meet the two, I&rsquo;ll secretly run an &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; on them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, please take care of my daughter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, till next time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that said, Elmesia&rsquo;s party went aboard their kingdom&#39;s Guardian Dragon King Ship to return to their nation.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Ruminas on the other hand was very casual with her travel methods since she could use her immense power to cast &lsquo;Spatial Movement&rsquo; and return to her kingdom almost instantly. As for the orchestra exchange, she told me she&rsquo;d contact me about the matter in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata remained in town. She checked on the kids&rsquo; classes at the Church and occasionally sparred with them. At the time, we couldn&rsquo;t find any suitable teachers for the children. It was at that point that Hinata showed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until then, she had been maintaining the peace of the Western Nations as the commander of the Holy Knight Order. We would collaborate from now on, and since we were handling the peace in the south for now, Hinata also seemed to have gotten some spare time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, could you spend some time with the kids?&rdquo; I asked her. &ldquo;Although I know how to use magic, I&rsquo;m not really a great teacher.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;ve already used Elemental Magic &lsquo;Waypoint Teleportation&rsquo; to register the town. I&rsquo;ll drop by to take care of the kids when I&rsquo;m free.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata accepted my request without hesitation; she really came in clutch this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, I had no intention of letting the children return to Ingracia in the first place. Due to my suspicion towards Yuuki, it was better to not leave them in the care of the Ingracia Kingdom. That&rsquo;s why I brought them out using the festival as an excuse&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t forget to register their transfer. In any case, instructing the children became more and more of a challenge for the schools of Ingracia. After &ldquo;Merging&rdquo; them with spirits, they had obtained incredible power. Any average tutor wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to handle them. So right now, I had to find someone who could properly instruct them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki told me that the Holy Knights were the most capable of commanding spirits. I had mentioned spirits by accident back then during our conversation. And according to Yuuki&rsquo;s reaction at the time, he seemed to have known about it from the start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I should probably have kept it a secret</span><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. You should have kept it a secret indeed.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">R-right. </span><span class="c1">Even Raphael-san seemed to be rubbing the salt in the wound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No no no, even if I hadn&rsquo;t said anything, he probably would have found out anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">We&rsquo;re just overthinking it, so let&rsquo;s not worry about it too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Umm, sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I still spilled the beans despite my suspicions towards Yuuki. I realized that in some corner of my heart, I still wanted to believe in him. I&rsquo;ll have to reflect on this slip-up and be more cautious in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The children were now my responsibility. And given these circumstances, Hinata&rsquo;s help was a godsend. The children also grew very close to Hinata through their time spent together during the festival. She was the perfect candidate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Speaking of having Hinata as a teacher, maybe I should also be a student and learn some things from her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After I settled on the idea, I stood alongside the kids behind the row of desks. Yet Hinata glared at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you trying to do here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, well, I wanted to observe for a bit&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nuisance, so get out now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, yes ma&rsquo;am&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so I was chased out cruelly. What a pity.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was what happened around a week after the end of the festival. The traffic on the streets had gradually settled down and the residents were no longer that busy. And so, we began to open and run the moderated dungeon. Quite a few adventurers seemed eager to explore the dungeon and a great number of them had inquired about it. And, as if in response to their expectations, we finally opened up the labyrinth. We had already made sufficient preparations and waited until just the right moment to open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The days gradually became busy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Problems emerged within hours of the debut. The issue at hand was the unexpectedly reckless and stupid way challengers went about exploring the dungeon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We expected this to happen for the first demonstration during the opening festival. That&rsquo;s why we took steps to lower the difficulty accordingly. But despite all that, the challengers were still having too much of a hard time. It would appear that what we set up was just not gonna work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We didn&rsquo;t put any traps on the first floor, and the monsters that spawned there were at most Rank F mobs. Being incapable of combat, these were monsters even a villager could easily handle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The intent behind the design of this floor was to provide challengers with a sense of pride and accomplishment and familiarize everyone with the environment inside, which was why we only placed monsters in the rooms that contained treasure chests. That said, the previous fall traps that Ramiris set were all removed. So, in order to successfully break through the level, you would still need to sketch maps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way I saw it, no matter how slow you were, a whole day was the longest you would need to complete the level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet for the past three days, not a single one managed to get to the second floor. Even that squad Basson led got lost big time and just gave up. Even though Basson&rsquo;s squad already had experience with the labyrinth, they still didn&rsquo;t plan out any noteworthy strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Should I say that I&rsquo;m dumbfounded or what&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I guess you could say Basson&rsquo;s squad was doing well, especially considering that some teams even fell victim to Rank D monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Perhaps I should correct myself:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that happened to </span><span class="c4 c8">a lot </span><span class="c1">of teams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of them were likely blinded by greed and didn&rsquo;t discover the monsters lurking in the room&rsquo;s corners. Plenty of idiots like that went straight for the treasure chest instead. They were probably caught by surprise by mere skeleton archers. As these comically bad adventurers rushed towards the treasure chests, their backs were inevitably pierced with arrows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, they just sucked. Their danger awareness was practically nonexistent. Among the idiots, some were at least smart enough to come in squads. Yet there were really no limits on human stupidity, since some of them actually tried to challenge our labyrinth on their own. That kind of behavior bordered on insanity.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, the spawn rate of monsters on the first floor was really low, and even if any were to spawn at all, they were Rank F at best. That said, when appearing in a group, monsters like those could still pose a threat. Actually, whether it indeed &ldquo;posed a threat&rdquo; was subject to debate. Rather, I should say that it posed sufficient threat to the challengers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you were to come in alone, even resting would prove challenging. With no one on guard, you couldn&rsquo;t even take a nap. No matter how weak Rank F monsters were, they were still capable of hurting you. Certain types of monsters would launch a sneak attack on sleeping humans, and if you weren&rsquo;t cautious enough, you could easily wind up dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I initially thought that these solo challengers had some great strategies in mind, but it turned out that they were just a bunch of brainlets. These reckless idiots didn&rsquo;t get anywhere and immediately left upon exiting the labyrinth. But, to be honest, based on how they had acted, they wouldn&rsquo;t have lasted any longer even if they had managed to somehow make it further down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From level two onward, not only were there more monsters in the hallways, Rank E opponents would also start spawning among them. When challengers made it to level five, they would begin to face Rank D monsters as well. If you had trouble merely getting through these earlier levels, you would definitely be killed when encountering Rank D monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the challengers had a particularly embarrassing reason for forfeiting&mdash;he was starving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On every tenth level we had set a save point, and on every fifth level we had a safe zone prepared where water could be refilled. We also subtly reminded everyone to bring more rations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other adventurers seemed to have made plans after analyzing Basson&rsquo;s squad&rsquo;s experience. But that alone wasn&rsquo;t enough. Adventurers seemed to be a very prideful bunch and they often ignored others&rsquo; advice. Not sure whether it was the fact that they couldn&rsquo;t die in the labyrinth, or that they were overconfident in their abilities. Either way, many of them didn&rsquo;t bring any rations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you got so lost that you were unable to find your way back to the entrance, then starvation came as no surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how I thought about it, it was their own fault.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">They wanted to open as many treasure chests as possible&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c8 c15">although I suppose I remember how that feels&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If our labyrinth was truly designed with the intention to kill, I doubt there&rsquo;d be anyone who could crack it even after a hundred years. But at this time, the challengers were either impoverished bodyguards or mercenaries, all of whom sucked at exploration.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">We don&rsquo;t have to panic just yet</span><span class="c1">&mdash;with that thought, I held my expectations for the next three days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, in the end, not a single one managed to reach the safe zone on the fifth level. The attempts had been miserable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being said, we did profit off of the entry fees, which was always a plus. But if this were to continue, the adventurers would all have low morale, and chances of challengers returning would be minimal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like we needed to re-examine the whole project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This unexpected matter had caused me grave concern.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This being the case, I called an emergency meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people attending were me, Veldora, Ramiris, and the observer, Masayuki. I also summoned Myourmiles who ran the project. After confirming everyone&rsquo;s arrival, I lead the opening statement: &ldquo;Everyone, it has been three days since the labyrinth went public, but this is not looking good. To be blunt, it actually sucks. For our entertainment&mdash;no, in order to have anyone want to return to our labyrinth&mdash;I think it would be best to provide them with a level of guidance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, people would have problems reaching the tenth floor if we were to continue like this. If that were to be the case, our labyrinth would probably have to be put on hold as a result. That&rsquo;s why I came to the conclusion that we had to at least educate them about strategy to some degree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm! Rimuru is right. If we allow this to continue, there won&rsquo;t be a chance for me to shine no matter how much longer I wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously! All the floors under level fifty are my proud work. I really want the world to see them. I think we can give them some hints!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I got Veldora and Ramiris&rsquo;s approval. Masayuki seemed to be pondering something&mdash;actually, he seemed confused. He didn&rsquo;t know why he was here and seemed to feel out of place. After all, he got summoned so abruptly. Anyhow, it looked like Masayuki probably needed a while to regain his cool, after which I would ask for his opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shifted my gaze away from Masayuki and over to Myourmiles. Getting to see Masayuki, who he admired greatly, had left him beaming with joy. It was probably the reason why he was particularly well-prepared to speak on the matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I have a word about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Any suggestion is welcome. Speak your mind; there&rsquo;s no need to hold back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Myourmiles nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Regarding the matter of giving hints, I hope you can be reserved about the number. It&rsquo;s only been three days and whatever adventurers we had so far, each one of them had subpar skill. I have already made contact with some seasoned adventurers through the Freedom Association, therefore I believe that there, surely, will be more adventurers of Rank C or higher with greater abilities in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it going to work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Although I can&rsquo;t grasp what&rsquo;s on Yuuki-san&rsquo;s mind, he did carry out his end of our deal. He contacted all the divisions of the Freedom Association throughout the land via &lsquo;Magic Communication&rsquo; in order to promote us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so there&rsquo;s some benefit to hosting one of their branches here after all. Anything else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve asked for favors from the merchants to assist in advertising. The experienced bodyguards and street mobs that were acquainted with them also joined the cause. Their report seemed to indicate very good feedback from the public.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both the delivery and collection of information were important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I then introduced Souka to Myourmiles and told her to assist him in his work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Souka was the leader of &lsquo;Dark Shadows&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c1">, and she also hosted the festival events with Myourmiles. It seemed that Myourmiles was good at dealing with people, and so the two immediately got along. I was glad that there was no prejudice involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, several of Souka&rsquo;s subordinates began operating under Myourmiles&rsquo;s command.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a matter of fact, even Souei helped him out with things. Souei was currently investigating Duke Muze&rsquo;s activity. I indirectly ordered him to also promote our nation during his mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, word of the dungeon even managed to reach some distant villages that weren&rsquo;t home to a division of the Freedom Association.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, we will wait for elites to gather from all across the land, and then make a decision?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. This project has just gone public,&rdquo; Myourmiles said enthusiastically. &ldquo;We have no need to rush in order to see any results just yet. I believe that we should calm down now and set our eyes on the future! Moreover, if the noblemen invest in the conquest, we can expect to see adventurers with Rank B and above.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Masayuki nodding in admiration, Myourmiles seemed to be pleased. Looks like he was eager to show off his abilities in front of Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What he said made sense as well. It was all because of how much Veldora and Ramiris complained that I too got nervous all of a sudden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Basson&rsquo;s entire squad combined could be considered as Rank B. With their current equipment, their individual abilities were around C to C+, far from outstanding. If the conquest were handled by someone above Rank B, surely, they would familiarize themselves with the labyrinth without requiring many hints.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In our labyrinth, you could pay to have your personal safety ensured. Even if we left them to their own devices, these experienced adventurers would be able to devise their own strategies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; there&rsquo;s no use for us to rush things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Public interest in the labyrinth was high. Apart from &lsquo;Magic Crystals&rsquo;, you could also harvest materials from the monsters, and knowing that you could sell these for a pretty penny, there was no end to the number of people who came flocking to the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nobles were also quick to react. Their willingness to partake in the conquest business was higher than we imagined. Some were quick witted enough to immediately hire adventurers upon returning to their nation, requesting them to help with the labyrinth conquest. These hired adventurers weren&rsquo;t driven into rash actions by their own desires. They would only operate after proper preparations and setting up plans. Right now, there weren&rsquo;t as many of these types of adventurers, but I expected to see a rise in number in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve set up an armory on the first floor, should we have the challengers try things out over there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Try out? What can they try there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was confused, so I began to explain my idea: &ldquo;I was thinking about setting up a training ground for people to practice. They can study how to counter traps and how to fight against monsters. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be more meaningful compared to giving them hints?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could also build a stadium of sorts along with it. Due to the increasing number of novice recruits to our nation&rsquo;s army, I hoped that this would be beneficial to their training. There wouldn&rsquo;t be any fatal accidents in the labyrinth, so maybe this would provide some very meaningful combat experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An unexpected ally came forth to support my idea&mdash;it was Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that were to be the case,&rdquo; he interjected rather casually, &ldquo;I think it would also be nice to hold lectures about the dungeon conquest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked at Masayuki in surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, was it bad for me to cut in like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no, there&rsquo;s no such thing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayy, that&rsquo;s good. The topic you guys were discussing sounded quite interesting. Even I could follow along, so I accidentally cut in,&rdquo; Masayuki said with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was adapting faster than I imagined, but he did seem kind of bold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then what sort of lecture should we hold?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Should we have all the adventurers gather at the big conference room if we were to hold lectures?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be very helpful to explain how the labyrinth worked to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can imitate tutorials in video games.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;&lsquo;</span><span class="c4 c8">Chutoriaru</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;? What is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That sounds tasty, is it food?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s suggestion got Veldora and Ramiris&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I thought that Veldora would know, but it seemed he actually had no idea about it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The language in this world could be translated pretty accurately, but when lacking a shared understanding of a subject, it would be hard for two parties to make sense of what the other was saying. Since Veldora had no idea what a tutorial was, Ramiris couldn&rsquo;t have known either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, Masayuki and I began to explain what tutorials were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a facility to train their abilities. We can simulate what actually takes place in the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-san is right. I think it is important to experience all possible scenarios before entering the labyrinth. If we can teach everyone the basics in the form of missions, I&rsquo;m sure that it will be easier even for the adventurers to understand&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adventurers probably aren&rsquo;t gonna be fans of lengthy explanations. So, we could only prepare a training ground for people who were serious enough to experience for themselves&mdash;this was Masayuki&rsquo;s suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, we planned to make it a mission-style tutorial. Before releasing the permits to enter, they would have to undertake some simple missions. In this way, the adventurers hoping to challenge the labyrinth would learn the bare minimum required for exploration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris seemed to have understood after hearing our explanations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That may be great. From my point of view, everything now is too simple to the point of being boring. I hope that you can build a training ground so that these challengers can improve their skills.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I think so too! If Milim </span><span class="c4">were</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to catch a glimpse of those past challengers, she would have lashed out and beaten all of them up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora, Ramiris and Myourmiles all gave the green light.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c42"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After studying the tutorial, we should let them try out some of the amazing weapons and armors crafted in the Tempest Federation. For those who struggled during their actual expedition, preparing more challenging tutorial missions sounded like it would be a fun idea as well,&rdquo; Myourmiles gave some rather note-worthy suggestions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, issuing a guidebook could be an interesting idea. It could also serve as a little tourism brochure. We could introduce the town to the new-comers and even find some suitable people to write some columns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of inefficiencies stemmed from the fact that no one really knew much about the labyrinth. For that reason, we decided to at least give them a basic tutorial. If we didn&rsquo;t, I doubt anyone would be able to make it past level fifty, where the difficulty really ramped up. And for those who wanted to fully experience the labyrinth, it would be good to prepare a more extensive practice course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, the Holy Knights were scheduled to be dispatched for level fifty and below, which you could say was the real deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like we couldn&rsquo;t expect a lot from the adventurers for now, so it looked like we&rsquo;d have to depend on the Holy Knights to be Ramiris and Veldora&rsquo;s playmates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, we decided to open the first floor as a practice field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also didn&#39;t forget to prepare an entrance for the new recruits, separate from the challengers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right; it would be good to separate them. Alright, I&rsquo;ll make them right away!&rdquo; Ramiris accepted it willingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With everything settled like that, I was about to end the meeting when&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, wait a moment. Another idea came to mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To my surprise, it was Masayuki himself who gave his opinion with sparkling eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right now, we only have inns and restaurants in safe zones, don&rsquo;t we? Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a good idea to prepare them on every floor as well? And you see, not having places like restrooms too can be tough. If we&rsquo;re connecting the spaces anyway, we should set up doors near the stairs of each floor. Since there are people who set out for battle without even a sleeping bag, don&rsquo;t you think it would be nice to provide them with a sleeping space for a premium price?&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Big Brain Time"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">What? This guy&hellip;could he be some sort of a genius?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Hmm, a restroom, huh. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I no longer have bodily functions. I completely forgot to consider that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was quite surprised by his insight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turned to Ramiris. She signaled her agreement with a vigorous nod.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Masayuki-kun, we will employ that idea right away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As expected of Masayuki-sama. Your insights are brilliant!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah yeah! I&rsquo;ll remove the safe zones and put up doors by the stairs connecting to the rest area instead!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Doing this was comparable to offering toilet paper at an exorbitant price next to restrooms that, </span><span class="c4 c8">incidentally</span><span class="c1">, didn&rsquo;t have any.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a dirty, but nonetheless effective tactic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that Masayuki was actually quite sharp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you have any other ideas, please don&#39;t be shy. Feel free to speak up,&rdquo; I urged him with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, as if he were remembering the games he played, he immersed himself deep in thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Umm</span><span class="c4 c25">m, let me see&hellip; Is it possible to make single-use save points? I was lucky enough to get to the tenth floor, but now without the pitfalls I think it would take quite a bit of time. </span><span class="c4 c25 c45">For the challengers, this isn&rsquo;t just a game, and I think the total amount of time they need to spend is one of the things that makes the labyrinth especially hard.</span><span class="c4 c25">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Hmm, I see. Surely, what Masayuki said has some truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the way the labyrinth was currently set up, it would take challengers several days just to get to the tenth floor. Hearing the idea just now, I realized that all the time spent in the labyrinth created a wealth of business opportunities. How about we go one step further and give this more thought?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mmm, what that boy there is saying is right! Humans are fragile, so we have to give this more consideration.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora was the first to approve Masayuki&#39;s suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">And just </span><span class="c4 c8">who</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was the one that gleefully made this labyrinth of horrors targeted towards &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; humans?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re disposable save points, then I can prepare them with my power, y&#39;know? But wouldn&#39;t it be more profitable to make an inn for them to stay at?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The single use savepoints could, in fact, be made. And Ramiris, for some reason, was surprisingly sharp whenever money was involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all, Ramiris-sama. Rather, this is precisely why we should charge a high price for it. Adventurers that don&rsquo;t have any pressing matters will choose to stay at an inn. However, there are probably people who are required to report back regularly. There are also people who would prefer to have at least one just in case anything unexpected happens while they&rsquo;re in the labyrinth. With that in mind, our sales will surely increase along with the &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Seemed like Myourmiles saw an opportunity for success and wanted to exploit it. Hearing that, I definitely </span><span class="c4 c8">could</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;think of various use cases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you ended up spending several days in the labyrinth, there could be times where you would want to know the situation outside. Adventurers employed by nobles were in on the action as well, so they might be obligated to report back every now and then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there strong monsters guarding the save point on the tenth floor? While in our case my party was easily able to defeat them, I think there would be quite a lot of people who would want to use the save point </span><span class="c4 c8">before </span><span class="c1">challenging those monsters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hearing Masayuki out, I very much agreed with him. Saving before challenging a Level Boss&mdash;that&rsquo;s what every gamer would come to expect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Memories of challenging the final boss without saving beforehand, dying, and then having hours of work go up in smoke all came flooding back to my mind. Those sad incidents could be forgotten with a laugh because it was just a game. But I wonder how furious people would be if it were in real life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Thinking about it, maybe our difficulty curve was a bit too harsh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris nodded along as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My boy, no, did you say your name was Masayuki? I think your views will be very helpful moving forward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yup, Yup. Incredible, incredible. As expected of an &lsquo;Otherworlder&rsquo; like Rimuru. I hope you&rsquo;ll keep pitching in, Masayuki!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in no time, they seemed to have accepted Masayuki as a colleague.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Masayuki, as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Below the fiftieth floor, where the going gets tough, I think it would be alright to remove those conveniences. But at least for the upper floors, where there are few skilled adventurers, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to hold their hands a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was firing off suggestions on operations management left and right. I wondered if this high adaptability was Masayuki&rsquo;s true character. Well, I didn&rsquo;t have any objections either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, then should we prepare a resting room beside each stairwell? And if they pay, let&#39;s make it so they could go to an area on the ninety-fifth floor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you saying we&rsquo;ll prepare an inn and a restaurant there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I don&rsquo;t plan on opening the exclusive elven shops (cabaret) for adventurers. We&rsquo;ll provide separate accommodations for those guys. Naturally, it&rsquo;ll be pricier!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tourist spots were pricier. If you went to places like the summit of Mount Fuji, something as simple as a coffee could be many times more expensive. The barbequed beef there was unparalleled, but regardless of the taste, it was quite pricey. In the same vein, it was only natural that using the facilities within the labyrinth would be more expensive than using the facilities outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this, the city on the ninety-fifth floor just got a li&rsquo;l more useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And Ramiris, about the one-use save points, could you really prepare them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! It&rsquo;s trivial for me! You see, there is an orb called the &lsquo;Event Recording Globe&rsquo;, and it can be used to make one-use save points.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris had gone and made something rather handy. It would work anywhere in the labyrinth, but, other than that, it was like a normal save point. If you registered with the &lsquo;Event Recording Globe&rsquo; and died, it would be possible to return to the recorded spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In case you got out of the labyrinth with a &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo;, your return point would be the point that was saved in the &lsquo;Event Recording Globe&rsquo;. This applied even if the structure of the labyrinth changed. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the exact same spot, but it&rsquo;d at least take you to the nearest safe zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sell it at the store for a high price.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, I think it would be good to hand out a few for promotional use.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I will include them in the treasure chests as a rare drop!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, everything was smooth sailing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GA-HAHAHA, finally some more fun!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although I think it&rsquo;s a bit too early to say, we should be seeing less people give up as a result of these changes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Masayuki were happily taking part in the conversation as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like this, by tackling the problems together one by one, progress was made, and improvements were proposed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Great, great. Everyone&rsquo;s insight </span><span class="c4">has</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;been helpful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first floor was converted into a tutorial-style training ground, which also included an announcement system. We set it up to have missions so that adventurers wouldn&rsquo;t be totally clueless coming in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether they made use of it or not was up to them. Nothing good came out of forcing stuff upon them. Plus, whatever happened would be their own responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, we also made it so that you couldn&rsquo;t die on the first floor. There could be adventurers that caused problems, and it would be troublesome if something happened to the employees in charge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only that, I also wanted to use the first floor for people to experiment with dying. We set it to resurrect immediately on the spot so it could also be suitable for a children&rsquo;s playground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also prepared a room for more experienced adventurers to practice fighting against different kinds of monsters. We captured some monsters and gave them a collar that allowed them to constantly revive. The adventurers could sharpen their skills here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Using the extra space, we also made an area dedicated to training our own recruits. From time to time, it would be fun to catch a large number of monsters for large scale collective battles.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The real dungeon started from the second floor downward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we wouldn&rsquo;t be deploying any lethal traps until the fourth level. There would only be Rank E to F lesser monsters roaming the area. The rooms would only have one Rank D monster. The treasure chests in them would contain items such as low healing potions which would be helpful for early labyrinth exploration. High price items such as gear were set to spawn only on the fifth floor and below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that pretty much summed up all the adjustments we made to the difficulty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">With this, the challengers can pick up the pace of their conquest of the dungeon starting tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything up until now was like a closed beta for a developing game, so it was no surprise that we weren&rsquo;t ready to open the real thing right away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;Well, in truth, we already had beta testers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But our testers were six of Shion&rsquo;s &lsquo;Yomigaeri&rsquo;, which might not have painted an accurate picture. Those guys swept through the first thirty-nine floors without a hitch. Unfortunately, they got annihilated by the fortieth floor&rsquo;s boss, the tempest serpent. Thanks to that, we got the false impression that the difficulty of the labyrinth was just right. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t fall victim to the traps nor did they struggle against the small fry monsters. I didn&rsquo;t think there would be any problems with the labyrinth difficulty after seeing their performance. Maybe they could even reach the fiftieth floor with a little bit more experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Seems like I needed to be more careful when choosing testers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion trained them herself and they&rsquo;d become more exceptional than we could have expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Welp, we can think about all that stuff later.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c15 c4 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, shall we wrap it up here? Are there no other comments or concerns?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if I was fully satisfied, I still had to make sure everyone else was fine with it, too. A lot of suggestions had already been made, so I thought that was gonna be all for today. However, Myourmiles suddenly interjected, &ldquo;Could I say one more thing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Is there something else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is. It&rsquo;s about the management of the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ahh, is this about the labyrinth&rsquo;s advertisement and fee collection?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I definitely was concerned about that part as well. It had only been three days, so the profits probably weren&rsquo;t that noticeable, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like Ramiris also smelled the money. She stared right at Myourmiles with an avaricious glint in her eyes. She was such a vulgar fairy that it made me laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haha, even if you look at me like that, the fund collection has only just started. The report I will give is related to the advertisement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles smiled bitterly as if he were giving an excuse to Ramiris. Myourmiles then hardened his expression and began the explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already come up with an idea of monetary reward to attract the attention of the nobles. How about one hundred gold coins?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ho ho?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That would only be natural&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Myourmiles interjected, &ldquo;the payment will instead be in the form of one star gold coin. At least, that&rsquo;s my plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Myourmiles had already read my intentions and </span><span class="c4">was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;planning accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I learned one thing from my mistake before. He thought of converting the star gold coins to just regular gold coins for the sake of liquidity. As far as I knew, even just one hundred gold coins should be nearly ten million Japanese yen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that too low?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might&rsquo;ve been a lot of money for an average joe, but it was hardly enough to convince a noble. Of course, the labyrinth had more to offer than one hundred gold coins. Rare drops from treasure chests, magic crystal, etc. but I didn&rsquo;t think we should be relying on those alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles answered my doubts with a reassuring smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huhuhu, those doubts are natural. I will advertise that this reward will go to those who beat the fiftieth floor. Only the first set of teams every month can claim this prize. If it&rsquo;s just one person, then he or she will get everything. If they have a party, then the reward will be split. However, there&rsquo;s more to it&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Myourmiles&rsquo;s explanation, each boss monster would drop a reward when subjugated. The tenth floor&rsquo;s Level Boss was a Rank B black spider. If you subjugated this one, then the first five teams would get a reward of three gold coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the twentieth floor was the Rank B+ evil centipede. It was a fairly strong monster that could spew a long-range and potent &lsquo;paralyzing breath&rsquo;. If you subjugated this, the first five teams would get a reward of five gold coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We placed a Rank B+ Crazed Ogre King and his five subordinates on the thirtieth floor. They differed from Benimaru and his clan in the sense that they were brutal monsters that acted only on instinct. They possessed tremendous strength and were capable of coordination. Since you would be battling against a group of monsters, fighting them would be difficult without a team. The reward for beating them was ten gold coins. The same first five team policy applied as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from here on out it genuinely became difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fortieth floor had the tempest serpent which was Rank A-. This guy had a lethal ranged attack called &lsquo;Poison Breath&rsquo; that was capable of instantly annihilating naive parties. Seriously, beating this guy would prove no easy feat, even for an A ranked adventurer like Kai. The reward was twenty gold coins. Only the first three teams could claim it, but only very few people would be able to beat it and survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The job as the fiftieth floor&rsquo;s boss was scheduled to be handled by Gozer and Mezer on a rotating basis. They had evolved beyond Rank A, so those who could take them down were quite limited. If you broke through the fiftieth floor, then you would receive one hundred gold coins. It was a much more substantial award, but that&rsquo;s to be expected if you looked at the difficulty.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Seems like a fair distribution. If we advertised it like this, would we be able to spark the competitive spirits of the nobles?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly like that. We can fuel their competitive drive even further by announcing the subjugators each month. Since the reward is only limited for the first time, the same person can&rsquo;t receive the reward multiple times. This can avoid causing excessive competition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see. </span><span class="c1">If they could only claim it once, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a point in obsessing over fighting the bosses of the prizes. We could also prevent the same people from monopolizing the monthly rewards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the amount of people that could receive the reward were limited each month, we could calculate it as a fixed business expense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, can we adjust the profit margins?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. I&rsquo;ve calculated based on the sales of our first three days of running the labyrinth, we may even raise the prize money a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The prize money would only be a small part of our actual profit. We were merely trying to incite the participants&rsquo; competitiveness and their willingness to try their luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our balance wouldn&rsquo;t be at a loss anyways, so this was a great strategy. Someone breaking through the fiftieth floor seemed like a distant future for the time being. With that in mind, the money we would have to distribute was rather trivial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If push comes to shove, we could ask Masayuki-sama to break through the fiftieth floor and to promote the labyrinth but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With Masayuki-sama it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fufu, as expected of Myourmiles; he was proactive with these things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He seemed to have made a plausible plan, so let&rsquo;s go with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plan. We could spread Masayuki&rsquo;s fame and also advertise the dungeon at the same time. We should look out for a time when the mainstream meta becomes stagnant and begin that operation then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I was thinking that as well. As </span><span class="c4">expected of Rimuru-sama</span><span class="c1">. Kufufu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing really, Myourmiles-kun. Mmfufuf.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I laughed with Myourmiles as I was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me, what about my opinion&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki wanted to say something, but I pretended that I didn&rsquo;t hear it.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Myourmiles </span><span class="c4">wasn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;finished yet. Rather, we were only just getting to the meat of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I want to propose something to Rimuru-sama: I wish to make the reward even bigger!&rdquo; he said, giving off a wicked grin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, I felt like he was such a reliable person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell me about it, Myourmiles-kun,&rdquo; I responded with a Buddha smile that showed my open-mindedness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to shock the nobles from the neighboring nations a bit and give a reward of one hundred star gold coins to whoever conquers the final floor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho ho?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;EH?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that&mdash;how much is that when you convert it to Japanese yen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I suppose it would be around a billion Japanese yen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, because of the low cost of living in this world, these coins would seem to be worth even more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Surely, you must be exaggerating, right, Myourmiles-kun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, if we do pitch our prize like that, even the most passive of nobles would reach for their own piece of the pie. They would start hiring adventurers to participate in the labyrinth conquest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that case, there would be an even larger flow of money. Money comes with consumers. Once we planted the seed of interest within the population, everyone would be scared to miss out on the trend. Even those who had little care for the matter would start to be attracted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bu-but, that&rsquo;s so much money we are talking&hellip;&rdquo; Ramiris muttered worriedly. But Myourmiles, filled with confidence, was unfazed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I wonder who&rsquo;s the ruler of this labyrinth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He asked provocatively before giving Veldora a peek.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora reacted quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, GA-HAHAHA! IT IS I, THE GREAT &lsquo;TRUE DRAGON&rsquo;. THE MAJESTIC &lsquo;STORM DRAGON&rsquo; VELDORA!&rdquo; he announced his title proudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm!? Where have I heard about this &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo; Veldora&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki sitting on the side was looking all mindful of something and seemed to be pondering, Myourmiles on the other hand was nodding with a villainous expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I knew that. Which is why, surely, there can&rsquo;t be anyone who would be able to defeat Veldora-sama, isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That goes without saying, Myourmiles. You are truly a man of wisdom, GAHAHAHA!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, it&#39;s nothing. I&rsquo;ve learnt this from observing Rimuru-sama every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Oi oi, can you not drag me into this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Veldora and Myourmiles were laughing out loud, I was pondering over Myourmiles&rsquo;s proposal. He suggested a reward of one hundred star gold coins. It was a pretty insane amount of money, but it was at the same time, the prize for successfully beating the final level. In other words, the prize for defeating Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Well, that would be impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though it might sound highly fraudulent, it wasn&rsquo;t a lie. I should say that it&rsquo;s still too early discussing the plausibility of that. From what I&rsquo;ve seen so far, I really doubt anyone would truly make it to the one hundredth level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right. I think our labyrinth is unbeatable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yup yup.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is most correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Perhaps people can still make it to level fifty, but the difficulty levels beyond that are beyond my imagination. Don&rsquo;t we even have dragons later, as well? How in the world are any adventurers supposed to defeat dragons?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon saying so, even Myourmiles gave a rather baffled expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone as bold and greedy as him would not tread any further than that, it truly meant that our labyrinth was too well defended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like we won&#39;t ever have to pay that one hundred star gold coins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That was the plan from the start. This is a bait for the nobles, therefore, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be a problem if we are to set the </span><span class="c4">prize</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that high. I heard that the Holy Knights are taking up the challenge as well. I&rsquo;m quite keen on seeing the result of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite putting it that way, Myourmiles looked convinced that even they would not be able to break through the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I agreed with him. I was terribly shocked when I heard the amount, but after I calmed down and thought it over, there was no need for me to worry about it being conquered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Myourmiles-kun, let&rsquo;s proceed in that direction.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I will trouble you to do some promotion and hopefully attract more participants.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure to phrase it like an invitation to battle issued by the demon lord and put as much spice in it as possible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Can you really advertise like that? Actually, hold on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I will continue to be the demon lord in the future, perhaps at some point, there will be foolishly daring brutes coming here to challenge me. It would be troublesome having to deal with them one by one, perhaps it would be better to announce it so that only those who make it through the hundredth floor get to challenge me&hellip; That&rsquo;s right. In that way, even the freeloader Veldora will become a more valuable asset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Alright, let&rsquo;s do just that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could you please add this as well, announce to the public that whoever makes it through the labyrinth would be granted the right to duel me. Masayuki, this applies to you as well. If people around you start instigating you to duel me, you can easily derail the topic using this excuse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. Seriously, I really don&rsquo;t want to fight Rimuru-san. Now I am saved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I get you. Then, Myourmiles-kun, I&rsquo;ll be counting on you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me. Then excuse me, for I must leave at once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Myourmiles sure </span><span class="c4 c8">is a</span><span class="c15 c4 c8">&nbsp;workaholic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as the matter was settled, Myourmiles got off his seat quickly. He then saluted us and left the room.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We watched Myourmiles leave. It would be okay to conclude the meeting now, but Masayuki looked rather unwell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That worried me a bit, so I asked: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Is there something that&rsquo;s bothering you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s related to what we just discussed. People seemed to think I am still sitting on the idea, but I will probably need to fight that guy one day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fighting that guy&mdash;is he talking about the promise that he made during the tournament?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By that guy, do you mean Gozer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&hellip; I&rsquo;ve put the word out like that, so I can&rsquo;t just run away. But if I were to really fight him, I will surely lose&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had a point. Masayuki&rsquo;s Unique Skill was incredibly special and possessed great utility. However, such utility was not much practical use in combat. Actually, he could win without fighting, through clever use of his Skill. So, I suppose, in a way, it was actually extremely suitable for combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, I couldn&rsquo;t just do nothing about Masayuki&rsquo;s duel with Gozer. Just like Myourmiles did, the audience probably had faith in Masayuki to win. And Masayuki had always acted to live up to that faith as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We canceling the duel at this point was out of the question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Would you like to get some training with the kids while Hinata is in town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She will probably butcher me. I just want to live a happy and peaceful life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, Masayuki rejected me with a bright smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Perhaps I should show this guy a hard time for once</span><span class="c1">&mdash;with that thought in mind however, wouldn&rsquo;t it be strange for kids living in modern-time peaceful Japan to be aggressive and warmongering?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Now that I think about it, I am a lot like Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it will be, in a sense, trouble for me if you were to lose. So let me think about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really? Then I will be counting on you, Rimuru-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, and in turn, you should help me out as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I will!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki was willing to cooperate. Nowadays his fame was very helpful for us. If Masayuki were to lose to Gozer, I would suffer great losses as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a troublesome problem that we had to resolve somehow. One way would&rsquo;ve been to convince Gozer, but that didn&rsquo;t seem to be very legitimate. Anyway, I&rsquo;d take my time about the matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After some more casual chit-chat, the emergency meeting concluded. And we began to revamp the labyrinth starting on the same day.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We were observing with high expectations. As I had predicted, we were fortunate to have corrected the problems pointed out by Masayuki. The difficulty of the labyrinth was lowered quite a bit. But then again, I had taken Myourmiles&rsquo;s advice as well, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too simple either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Now then, I wonder how everyone is reacting to the changes?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c15 c4 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, there were still many idiots who wouldn&#39;t listen to instructions. Just as before, they ignored the tutorial missions and focused on progressing within the labyrinth instead. But, naturally, there was no way they could conquer the floors that easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, those were the inflexible people who kept on challenging floors over and over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I wonder what drove them to do so?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Could it be that they had employers? Or out of their pride perhaps?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The answers were never noble in any way. In fact, they were more practical reasons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day the Labyrinth was made public, Basson&rsquo;s party found a rare-grade sword from the treasure chest. To them it was a most incredible weapon. It seemed that the competitors had a drastically different understanding of things compared to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rare-grade equipment normally referred to an evolved version of a piece of quality equipment crafted with magisteel, after it experienced a long period of time, it eventually began to show special properties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magisteel produced in our nation used iron ores mined from the mountain region by the high orcs. They were exposed to the magicules unleashed by Veldora which prompted their change in quality. That&rsquo;s why as soon as these ores were moved to the storage section of the labyrinth, their quality began to change naturally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only was it easy to source, it was of very fine quality as well. And so, we generously used it as crafting material for equipment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike the gear circulating the markets of the Western Nations, this equipment solely relied on magisteel to be crafted. Since they were different right down to the raw material, even the average gear in our nation&rsquo;s garrison would appear to be special-grade to outsiders. Needless to say, it outperformed the challengers&#39; equipment by several orders of magnitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the gear worn by the soldiers of our nation, they were crafted by Kurobee&rsquo;s disciples. There were around a dozen of them working at the workshop. Under Kurobee&rsquo;s guidance, they were crafting equipment day in and day out. That&rsquo;s why we got to produce gear in mass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even these weapons crafted by Kurobee&rsquo;s disciples were all superior in quality when compared to the average gear being sold on the markets of the Western Nations, even approaching the quality of special-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These days, their creations were all put inside the treasure chests. The failed creations were destroyed and the ones that were deemed somewhat useful, were placed in the treasure chests in the labyrinth. There was good gear and bad gear, but there was, nonetheless, outstanding work among them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of them&mdash;a sword, barely making it to rare-grade, was taken by Basson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rate for getting one of them was one in a hundred. This probability seemed to be the sweet spot regarding the chance of winning the jackpot.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, if it was crafted by Kurobee, even his failed work would reach rare-grade. At first glance, you may think this was good stuff, but according to Kurobee himself, these failures were just failures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is a distinct difference,&rdquo; Kurobee declared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I did some intense digging and, eventually, I uncovered some insights. While both pieces of equipment were of the same grading, each piece had a lot of variance in terms of their stats. Kurobee could identify this and tell whether his work was a success or a failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, I compared the sword forged by Kurobee&rsquo;s disciple and his own creation. Both were rare-grade, yet their differences were very obvious. It was thanks to the increase in precision of my &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; that I was able to realize the differences. Had Kurobee not pointed it out for me, I probably would not have known how to tell them apart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To give an easy example, let&rsquo;s say I copy a piece of equipment crafted by Kurobee. Obviously, the end product would be of the same grade. However, just like I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I could not recreate the quality. At first glance, the replica would appear to be the same as the original, but in truth, it was an inferior version of the original. This was the &ldquo;difference&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason for such a thing to occur was probably because my blacksmithing technique was not as good as Kurobee&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, I concluded that weapons had many different levels of quality. While even for weapon merchants, let alone amateurs, to tell such a difference, I started to understand how to differentiate good weapons from the bad.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To those whose lives relied on the quality of their weapons, the difference could be crucial. You never knew when you would be ambushed by monsters in this world. Weapons and armor with good quality could be their life saving tools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During the founding festival, Kurobee&rsquo;s exhibition caused a stir among the public. There were even many people who wished to purchase his work. We were still considering that point, we planned to decide after doing some more market investigations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Level Boss on the tenth floor would drop rare-grade equipment&mdash;one of the best masterpieces crafted by Kurobee&rsquo;s disciples. While it was far from Kurobee&rsquo;s work, it was still a high grade item when compared to the average gear on the market.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adventurers, naturally, would want better gear. No wonder Basson was so happy about it. After all, for an average grade weapon, as long as its quality was nice, its price would also be ten times higher than the average ones in the market. Moreover, for special-grade, I had been told that it could go as high as fifty times the market price.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for rare-grade, it was all up to luck whether they could get it or not. It was rarely produced, and it wasn&rsquo;t something you necessarily would be able to buy with money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obviously, there would be people who get obsessed with the labyrinth and try to come back for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Basson and his men were already promoting for us at the tavern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey hey, check this out, people! This is the sword that is worthy of my skills!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like that, Basson and his posse were bragging with his weapon at every opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The news that the tenth floor&rsquo;s Level Boss would drop rare-grade equipment began to spread among the challengers. The news also began to reach the ears of the merchants as well as the members of the Freedom Association across the continent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We never expected all these people wishing to become rich overnight would flood our nation. This was what led to the latest situation within the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really needed to thank Basson and his party for promoting our nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, rushing straight into it was never a recipe for success in the labyrinth. After all, those who weren&rsquo;t willing to listen to our instructions, were always beaten by people who finished their tutorial missions before challenging the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyone with a bit of brain would know that the right thing to do was to listen to the instructions carefully first. Now, there were a lot more people who would do their tutorial mission seriously and receive their training on the first floor. The challengers were able to utilize the new knowledge they learned and apply it on the spot. There were also counters that sold various utility items, and this brought in a small fortune on its own.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few days after our revamp of the labyrinth, there were teams that made their way to the fifth floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second floor was merely very wide, and up until the fourth floor, most of the traps were just for show. They were not exactly malicious in any way. As long as you sketched maps of the passages, it was a piece of cake to reach the fifth floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">That&rsquo;s why it was </span><span class="c4">a result</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that we expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the fifth floor onward, it was up to the challengers&rsquo; abilities. The lethality of the traps increased, and there were Rank D and above monsters roaming around the area. On top of that, we also began to raise the chances of treasure chest containing more expensive items.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I do hope they will give it their best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I was cheering for them, the people who made it to the fifth floor quickly got into tough fights. It was likely just because of their exhaustion. Having to be on guard against monsters all the time would easily exhaust someone mentally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many people returned to the stairs temporarily to use the resting zone. The business of the inns on level ninety-five had been booming as well, which was exactly what we wanted.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later, there were challengers that started making it to levels five through eight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The adventurers from different nations&rsquo; Freedom Association branches had arrived as well. Among them were many skillful adventurers who were contracted by noblemen. The town had been bustling with life. People were discussing strategies with excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of the second group of people joining the battle, the morale of people who fought first was raised as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then that some people began to cheat, ignoring proper rules of engagement and began to sell maps publicly within the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people were probably super bad with direction like I am. Something like the labyrinth couldn&rsquo;t be conquered with strength alone, that&rsquo;s why I understood why they wanted to cheat in this way, but&hellip; I hoped they would just find companions to team up and assign each other&rsquo;s role appropriately together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why we were broadcasting, both inside and outside the labyrinth, that we would constantly change the internal layout. There were sad moans coming from the challengers all over the place, and many who just wouldn&rsquo;t stop complaining about it. But I was the demon lord&mdash;I was in no way obligated to listen to their opinions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hoped to make them realize, sooner rather than later, that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use maps not made by themselves. Essentially, if you didn&rsquo;t make maps yourself, you would be unable to tackle the structural change of the labyrinth during your conquest. In a sense, this was a friendly reminder for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I suppose this is what they call tough love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The frequency of the layout changes was around once every two to three days. It would take at least a couple hours to break through one floor. It didn&rsquo;t seem plausible that they&rsquo;d make it to the checkpoint on the tenth floor without encountering a change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why the change in the layout of the labyrinth had many benefits. Challengers would start to strategize properly and give up on buying and selling maps. There would probably be people starting the conquest as soon as the layout change began and try to sketch and sell maps within the same day. Those people could do whatever they wanted.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We integrated this feature so as to prevent cheaters, and I was greatly satisfied with the result. However, we couldn&rsquo;t underestimate our challengers, either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The adventurers from the Freedom Association began to challenge the labyrinth as well. There were many who were capable caster of the elemental magic &lsquo;Auto Mapping&rsquo;. Exploration became extremely easy for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">These adventurers from the Freedom Association sure are different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only were they used to battling monsters, their techniques were very skillful. Moreover, their strong suit was their division of roles. Basson&rsquo; party only consisted of combat-type individuals, but the parties who joined later had well thought out organization of members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Against monsters, there were raiders who specialize in combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The traps and mazes were handled by explorers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There were also knowledgeable treasure hunters</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The balance of a team was highly valued. As expected from adventurers who knew how to learn and adapt. They completed their missions with ease and challenged the labyrinth over and over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people who were good at exploring ruins were also good at disabling traps. They were relatively calm when stumbling upon treasure chests, they were also more cautious compared to bodyguards or mercenaries. They had been displaying work ethic beyond our expectations. And they understood the rules almost instantly. I was fortunate that we didn&rsquo;t make the labyrinth too easy.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, a few days after the different teams began to come in, there were already people who made it through the tenth floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The morale of the challengers was greatly boosted. They were studying the strategies of the people who came before them. Strategize carefully and progress through each floor gradually. Once a floor was beaten, the news would spread quickly. People then started to imitate their strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose people were actually selling information about strategies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Should I praise their resourcefulness?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now that they realized selling maps wouldn&rsquo;t work, they began to sell information instead. About that, I did want to commend their efforts. We wanted the atmosphere to become livelier as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The active performance of the challengers also became a topic of discussion among the townsfolk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shops, inns, restaurants&mdash;the news travelled from one to another. There were legendary stories of tragedies, comedies, and more. It was then that one story in particular was gaining popularity. There was a team that was progressing at lightning fast speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had a balanced team of ten people. What their team did to level up quickly was by sending one person to join another team that had already made it to level 10, register himself at the level 10 checkpoint and then utilized a &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo; to get back to the entrance. From there on, he rejoined his actual team and would start immediately from level 10 and onward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were already expecting such things, that&rsquo;s why we felt fine about it. Their progress had been shockingly fast, nonetheless. It only took them a short span of three days before defeating the Level Boss on the twentieth floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These guys were truly capable. Each of their abilities were up to Rank B. Their entire team was close to Rank B+. Moreover, the ten men&rsquo;s cooperation was extremely well coordinated, making their actual strength closer to Rank A-.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was almost impossible for me to not question their innocence, considering how fast they were progressing. The reason being, that they had been choosing the shortest route almost without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Spirit interference detected. &lsquo;Spirit Communication&rsquo; conducted by a spirit wielder was found.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ah, so that&rsquo;s why&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spirit wielders were a special type of magic user that could command spirits. One of their magic skills was &lsquo;Spirit Communication&rsquo;, the ability to hear words spoken by the spirit. If they could communicate with wind or earth spirits, they would be able to find the right path leading to the stairs with ease. Since they could gain such information, things such as maze were meaningless for the spirit wielders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">How cunning! Spirit wielders are so cunning!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, they weren&rsquo;t breaking any rules. Depending on the different properties of the spirits they commanded, even if they used &lsquo;Spirit Communication&rsquo;, it wasn&rsquo;t a guaranteed way to learn the correct route. Essentially, there were very few spirit wielders out there, which was why I had never expected them to pull such a move on us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a totally justified way of progressing in the labyrinth, so it didn&rsquo;t warrant a response from us. I even wanted to praise them for coming up with an idea like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like their team would continue to progress at a fast pace. For each floor they made it through, their latest exploits would be broadcasted throughout town. These people rapidly rose to fame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The name of their team was &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;&mdash;an elite task force led by a mysterious spirit wielder whose identity was a mystery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their popularity was rivaling even that of the &lsquo;Shining&rsquo; led by Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we had expected, powerful people began to gather here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Young and inexperienced challengers who dreamed of becoming famous and rich would trickle into town. And so, the number of challengers rose rapidly. The sales of the labyrinth were finally taking off.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We gathered once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been ten days since we last altered the layout of the labyrinth. Our meeting today was to discuss whether there were any new issues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike last time, the meeting went smoothly, and everyone was content.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, you are called Masayuki, right? I knew from the start that you&rsquo;ve got some balls, but it turned out that you are an incredibly courageous man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as the meeting started, Veldora, who was in a great mood, began to praise Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, is that so? Thank you for the compliment&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki was very confused after being praised out of the blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Who is this guy?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;That seemed to be what he was trying to convey through his face as he turned to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was present last time during Veldora&rsquo;s introduction. But Masayuki was too nervous back then, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be strange if he had forgotten about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we introduce him last time&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, last time&hellip; Ehhh, the conference kind of just started on its own&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Eh, was that so?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. As individual &lsquo;Honjou Masayuki&rsquo; stated, Veldora did not introduce himself.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ahh, I see. It looks like I was the one who didn&rsquo;t recall clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">No wonder Masayuki was confused. Let me introduce you two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I shall introduce him once more. This guy is my good friend, big bro Veldora. I asked him to act as the Level Boss for the one hundredth floor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, I am Veldora, and I recognize you. A pleasure to meet you, Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora seemed to have recognized Masayuki as he greeted him with a happy smile. But as soon as he finished, Masayuki&rsquo;s face turned pale as snow. He then said: &ldquo;Ehh, a-about that&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t Veldora that catastrophe-rank monster that wiped out the Farmus army&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Oh yeah, we did put out rumors like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">It&rsquo;s fine to tell him the truth, but that would just be more trouble. It&rsquo;s meaningless to tell him about it, so I might as well just be vague here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah yes, he is very strong, so you better not piss him off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAHAHAHA! My heart is as wide as the sea, and I seldom become angry! By the way, if you were to offer me some desserts, I would be generous enough to grant you my divine protection!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora had gotten ahead of himself and said some foolish things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I rolled up my notebook at lightning speed and gave his head a whack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Punishment executed. Discipline is essential.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Animal cruelty in action"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Probably out of shock, Veldora shouted &ldquo;What the hell!&rdquo; I then ignored him completely and began to introduce Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This here is Ramiris. She&rsquo;s the fairy that runs the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki mumbled: &ldquo;So I didn&rsquo;t remember it wrong&hellip;&rdquo; almost speechless before being brought back by my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned to Ramiris who was fluttering her wings nearby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, y-yes&hellip; So Ramiris-san is a fairy. By the way, you are truly strong to have created such an incredible labyrinth,&rdquo; he said to praise her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, it was Ramiris&rsquo;s turn to get a big head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ohoho! Aren&rsquo;t you the sweet talker. Why don&rsquo;t you become my lackey. Also, Rimuru! Did you hear that? This guy just called me strong!&rdquo; she bragged excitedly as she lunged at me with a flying kick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">How annoying. She gets so prideful every time someone remotely praises her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I dodged her flying kick effortlessly and played dumb about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, how strong of you indeed. That being said, if Masayuki really wants to be your lackey, I guess it would be up to you?&rdquo; I replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">A chosen hero who&rsquo;s also a lackey of a demon lord. That&rsquo;s gonna be my new light novel series.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Masayuki himself looked to be deeply conflicted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ehhh, ehh&hellip; So </span><span class="c4">how&rsquo;s Ramiris-san as a person?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki whispered next to me, and so I replied in a hushed tone, &ldquo;She may not look the part, but she&rsquo;s one of the demon lords, just like me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;AHH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki froze upon hearing that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris approached the dumbfounded Masayuki with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Despite keeping our conversation quiet, nothing escapes her damn big ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yahooo! I am Ramiris of the &lsquo;Eight Star Demon Lords&rsquo;. Masayuki-chan, nice to meet ya!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, eh? Ramiris&hellip;-san&hellip;is a demon lord? And Veldora-san is a dragon&hellip; Oh my God! There&rsquo;s no way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Masayuki&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had lost himself at learning that the people in contact with him this entire time were a demon lord and the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;. It looked as if his soul had gone to heaven.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should have made sure to introduce them from the start. This was my miscalculation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was Masayuki&rsquo;s fault as well. During our last meeting, he was a bit too casual and relaxed. That&rsquo;s what led to my misunderstanding that Masayuki already knew who those two were. I thought that this guy was quite bold, but I never expected that he didn&rsquo;t know about those two&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they say that ignorance is a sin, it may sometimes be a blessing. To have gained recognition without himself even being aware of it, I once again realized that Masayuki&rsquo;s luck was not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Myourmiles who extended a helping hand to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ramiris-sama, please don&rsquo;t force this upon him. It will make Masayuki-sama very troubled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s probably because Myourmiles was Masayuki&rsquo;s fan. He seemed to think that Ramiris was just joking around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">To Ramiris&rsquo;s demand, the kind-hearted Masayuki must be very troubled</span><span class="c1">&mdash;that&rsquo;s probably what he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, his fantasy should have been diminished at this point, was it because of Masayuki&rsquo;s Skill? &mdash;No, that&rsquo;s not the case. How should I put this, Myourmiles really seemed to have faith in Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Myourmiles&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4">will</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">appeared</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to have reached Masayuki. He gave a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is Myourmiles. He&rsquo;s a trustworthy consultant of mine. The financial department of the Tempest Federation is handled by him. In other words, he&rsquo;s the minister of finance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am Myourmiles, pleased to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahaha, Myourmiles-san is such a nice guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-you are too kind. I&rsquo;m just a black market&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As Myourmiles-san has said, I can&rsquo;t be Ramiris-san&rsquo;s lackey. Because I&rsquo;ve already promised to assist Mikami&mdash;I mean, promised to assist Rimuru-san,&rdquo; Masayuki explained to Ramiris with an apologetic gesture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles followed up: &ldquo;That is a good point as well. After all, Rimuru really knows his way around recruiting people.&rdquo; His expression was like he knew me all too well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I don&rsquo;t get it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris decided to join in as well, &ldquo;Ah, then that can&rsquo;t be helped! Rimuru sure is cunning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Finders, keepers,&rdquo; I answered rather uncaringly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, Veldora suddenly began to brag arrogantly on the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAHAHA, there aren&rsquo;t many reliable men like Rimuru out there. Ramiris, I&rsquo;d advise you to give up on one upping Rimuru. Let&rsquo;s not mind that, introduce Masayuki now. Or else this conversation can&rsquo;t continue!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even though I was actually very mindful of how these people think of me, I recalled that Masayuki hadn&rsquo;t even finished introducing </span><span class="c4 c8">himself</span><span class="c1">. Although, it seemed that everyone already knew his name, so this almost felt like an after-thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a point. Then, Masayuki, please introduce yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I finished, Masayuki nodded as he replied, &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Some of you probably already know me, my name is Masayuki. I came from the same world as Rimuru-san, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m helping him out. I seem to be called a &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo; a lot by people, please don&rsquo;t take it seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki turned to face everyone, straightened his back, and began to introduce himself in earnest. When he called himself a &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo;, he seemed eager to add &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a running joke.&rdquo; But considering Myourmiles was present, he didn&rsquo;t say it out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki seemed to adapt well and had already calmed down. He wasn&rsquo;t the least bit emotionally scarred. Even though he had already met everyone here during the last conference, it was pretty impressive of him to be able to crack a smile in front of Veldora and Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">He&rsquo;s got great potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps the reaction the bystanders had to him wasn&rsquo;t entirely the doing of &lsquo;Chosen One&rsquo;. Could it be that they were simply more influenced by Masayuki&rsquo;s own personality? I doubt his Unique Skill alone would have such a great impact. But, well, that&#39;s something I&#39;d have to examine in due course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While thinking this over, everyone had finished introducing themselves.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had all settled in our seats. Last time, we had an emergency meeting, but this time we were in no hurry. There was a casual mood in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which, Masayuki-chan, you are really good. Our success was all thanks to you!&rdquo; Ramiris shouted excitedly as soon as she was seated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;While on the topic, Myourmiles is mighty ingenious as well. Your call to not lower the difficulty of the labyrinth was remarkably prescient!&rdquo; Veldora praised Myourmiles as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I agreed with both of their views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Indeed, we can achieve great success when we all cooperate and contribute ideas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are too kind. I am glad to be of help for everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was nothing extraordinary, it was all due to everyone&rsquo;s hard work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they finished praising each other, we began to discuss the current state of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our performances were looking up. During the peak sessions of the labyrinth, it was so good as to make Myourmiles shout with joy. Moreover, the visitors to the town would all rest at the inns and use the services of the restaurants. I heard that business had been booming lately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here are the reports,&rdquo; Myourmiles said as he handed me some documents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris were interested as well, so I gave them each a copy. I had Raphael-san run the numbers in detail. This way I would make sure that the content was in order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Let&rsquo;s see now. </span><span class="c1">I glanced through the report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Fortunately, I could turn into my humanoid figure in times like this. Even though I </span><span class="c4 c8">could</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;still read documents in my slime form, in terms of efficiency in tackling work-related matters, the humanoid form was definitely much more convenient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that after our renovation to the labyrinth, it had been running smoothly. It could be verified by the statistics in this report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like our promotion has had a great effect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo; Myourmiles nodded happily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been bustling with work every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t sure if Veldora and Ramiris had a clue what they had in front of them, but they were staring at the report intently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The content was mainly the recent financial details with some special matters documented as well. For instance, adventurer id card details.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles asked for Yuuki&rsquo;s assistance so that we could check through adventurer id cards to confirm permission to enter the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a type of magical card that also monitors the user&rsquo;s health status. It was a very convenient tool that occasionally recorded their status. The way to use the card was just like the explanation I got from the association&rsquo;s help desk, so the adventurers were all very familiar with it. Bodyguards and mercenaries who were not part of the guild were in the minority, so it was very easy to integrate the system into our labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fee for entering the labyrinth was three silver coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The card production was handled entirely by the Freedom Association. It was meant to reduce the workload at our service window. Our nation would issue a simplified version of the card as well at a price of ten silver coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most people had the card from the association, but occasionally there were people who would purchase the simplified cards. Considering the profits we reaped from that process, the entry fee for the labyrinth alone earned us a sizable income.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, the report also mentioned the three items crafted by Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Revival Bracelet&rsquo;&mdash;it was only given out for free the first time. The reason for providing a free sample was to allow people to experience the convenience of the product.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would have to purchase it from the second time onward. The price was two silver coins, a very reasonable price. Because this &lsquo;Revival Bracelet&rsquo; would heal all the severe wounds inflicted before death, and then revive the person. After much discussion, we came to the conclusion that we might as well give them this little bonus effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, if someone were to enter the labyrinth again without wearing the &lsquo;Revival Bracelet&rsquo;, we had to send a broadcast in order to get the attention of the person in question. Although they&rsquo;d have to bear the responsibility, we still didn&rsquo;t want lives to be lost out of negligence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">To facilitate purchasing them, we situated the revival point next to the counter. This way, the &lsquo;Revival Bracelet&rsquo; became a necessity</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was selling like hotcakes&mdash;the best, in fact, among the three items.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The item &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo; was limited to single person usage. The benefit of it was that it could return the user to the outside instantly. It was a life-savor when you got lost. In essence, it was an item made for emergency usage. Its price was rather high, at a cost of thirty silver coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Those who tried to save some cash by buying a &lsquo;Revival Bracelet&rsquo; instead of a &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo; should reconsider their choices. After all, while you could return to the entrance after death in this way, you also had a chance to lose your equipment. Despite keeping your armor intact, any weapons that fell out of your hands would be left behind. No one in their right mind fought while holding on to their loot, they were more likely to lay that stuff on the hallway floor. Subsequently, those goodies wouldn&rsquo;t be extracted, and, in a sense, it was a penalty </span><span class="c4">for death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There aren&rsquo;t many people who risked returning by dying, that&rsquo;s probably why the item sold that well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sale of &lsquo;Event Recording Globe&rsquo; was a lot worse than we expected. However, there was a history where a large amount of it was purchased. It cost one gold coin, an expensive price as it would convert to around a hundred thousand yen. It looked like some people had the foresight to purchase this expensive item in large quantities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could easily utilize death to return to the entrance by using this item. I&rsquo;m guessing that some people may be very stubborn in challenging the Level Bosses, so it&rsquo;d be very dangerous to give away these items cheaply. This was why we set the price this high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with that being case, I still thought there would be demand for it. Upon reaching the deeper levels, the difficulty of the floors would increase drastically. Given that the checkpoint only appears every ten levels, it must give the challengers the impression of trying to reach heaven&rsquo;s gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I always thought that it would one day become profitable, even if just a little. Some people would, surely, find it useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There were also other ideas, such as lending weapons and armor. But they didn&rsquo;t seem to be profitable yet. This </span><span class="c4">gear</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was prepared by Kurobee, they were of excellent quality. The only people using this seemed to be the ones who lost their weapons during their last attempt. However, it was slowly gaining popularity. When the rumors surrounding the amazing quality of the weapons spread far and wide, surely, there would be more people renting them.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything seemed to be going smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, even if we finally landed some success, we still couldn&rsquo;t get careless. Times like these require even more caution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fastest progressing team had been doing well. So far no one had deserted. They were gradually delving into deeper floors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately for us, they managed to inspire other challengers&rsquo; motivation. They would come back to the labyrinth even after failed attempts, and our sales had been going up because of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">We must maintain this flow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">&ldquo;I want to challenge the labyrinth again&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&mdash;if we could get everyone to think that, it would be surprisingly easy to get over a thousand customers in one day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, according to Myourmiles-kun&rsquo;s report, we have been very successful. However, we must not be satisfied just yet. Please feel free to express any feedback you have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to keep everyone on their toes, I said this to give it a head start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris was the first to react.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I got something!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then Ramiris-kun, please take the stage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s about the spirit wielder&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spirit Communication&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a blind spot for us where they can gain information from the spirits! But I can actually interfere with it! So what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&mdash;interference you say&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I did want to sabotage them a bit, that did also seem rather despicable. Because our customers were using totally valid ways of progressing, if we were to use unethical tricks to interfere it would seem to be unfair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not a war, nor some competition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are sure that the spirits are not being forced into service, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No they aren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s evidence that the spirits like them if they are able to build such a trustworthy relationship with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then we shouldn&rsquo;t interfere. I dislike the idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right! I half guessed that Rimuru would say so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris compromised immediately. While she did propose it, she likely didn&rsquo;t want to do it either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, lying is no good. But Ramiris, how about you create a zone without any spirit? That &lsquo;Spirit Communication&rsquo; thing, isn&rsquo;t it used to hear what the local spirits have to say? Would it therefore be rendered useless if there aren&rsquo;t any spirits to begin with?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, this surprising response came from Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">He&rsquo;s usually very useless, and to think he&rsquo;s come up with such clever words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, what&rsquo;s with your surprised look?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Yikes, this guy is sharp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Nothing, only that I feel truly impressed. I thought just now, </span><span class="c4 c8">as expected from Veldora</span><span class="c1">. Your suggestion was very good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I panicked a bit trying to answer him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet Veldora&rsquo;s mood was immediately cheered up afterward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? My wisdom has finally come in handy, GA-HAHAHA!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He sure got fooled fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, what about it, Ramiris?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, no problem! I can ask the spirits to change their residence. Without spirits that possess will, the challengers won&rsquo;t be able to activate &lsquo;Spirit Communication&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looks like there isn&rsquo;t any problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thanks to Veldora, we would have a chance against the spirit wielders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be counting on you. It&rsquo;s great to have been able to exchange ideas like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, you are correct, my wisdom&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep, next one. Does anyone else want to give his suggestion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t have Veldora keep acting smug anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s get to the next person.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person who then raised his view was, again, Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the case that you can&rsquo;t get any items from defeating monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monsters upon death would drop items&mdash;these are common occurrences in video games, but it would seem bizarre in real life. I figured it was enough that you could extract materials or &lsquo;Magic Crystals&rsquo; from defeated monsters&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will it be necessary?&rdquo; Veldora asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To which Masayuki&rsquo;s answer was very simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Not really, it&rsquo;s just that the healing potions are surprisingly expensive. High ranking adventurers may have the spare cash to use them sparingly, but most average men won&rsquo;t bear to use them. Instead, they would choose to flee. Some people probably think that, if you can be revived without a scratch inside the labyrinth, you might as well endure more defeats as opposed to spending the money buying potions. That&rsquo;s why, we might as well have monsters drop some low tier healing potions so that everyone can easily access them? But that&rsquo;s just my view.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Umm&mdash;he had a point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Healing potions were among the list of things being promoted in our nation. People were gradually realizing their practical value. However, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly cheap. And the price had hindered the number of customers from growing any faster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In our nation, a lower healing potion would cost four silver coins. While a higher healing potion was sold for thirty-five silver coins. And regarding full healing potions, we weren&rsquo;t even selling them on the market. And even if we did, it would cost somewhere around five hundred silver coins to five gold coins, and more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The cost of living in our nation&rsquo;s cheapest inn, accounting solely </span><span class="c4">for</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;lodging, cost three silver coins. It cost five silver coins instead for included baths and a meal. Better inns, used mainly by merchants, cost around ten silver coins, excluding meals. This is the equivalent of a Rank D challenger&rsquo;s entire day&rsquo;s worth of work within the labyrinth. The average income was around fifteen silver coins. And even with a team to improve efficiency, it fell around twenty silver coins. This income was passable for now. It was sufficient to make a living with this money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it may not be the case for any emergency situations. For instance, them falling sick or being severely wounded. They had no chance to experience a complete social welfare system. In addition, it was also important to maintain their weapons and armor. They&rsquo;d need to replace them when they were broken. They would also have to save up money to purchase better gear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Low rank adventurers had a hard time even hunting monsters. In order to improve their quality of life, they would have to train themselves to become better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was quite challenging for these people to just pay four silver coins. After all, they also had to save up for the entry fee of the labyrinth. I could understand their feelings when they could only watch and were not willing to purchase&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they were to come across a treasure chest, they would become rich overnight, but still, I didn&rsquo;t think they really had the capacity to waste any of their savings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is a common setting in video games. Masayuki had a point, however&hellip; All of the monsters in the labyrinth are spawned naturally. It&rsquo;s not that simple to have them all carry items&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These people weren&rsquo;t my subjects anyway, there was no reason I should give them such convenience so easily. While I wished to help them, they should first try to survive on their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After all, there was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Freedom</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Association for such circumstances. They were not the citizens of this town, so I couldn&rsquo;t grant them aid in the name of the nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, this was the reality, who couldn&rsquo;t keep up was left behind&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We probably can do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was almost about to give up, Ramiris&rsquo;s carefree voice rang in my ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You serious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, all we have to do is to feed the items to the newborn monsters!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Assuming we could do that, it opened the door for all manner of possibilities. We could have treasure chests keeping all the good stuff, while the monsters would drop all the garbage. But even if it was garbage, to low rank challengers, they would be a source of their income.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This would, in fact, be a welcome change for low rank challengers in the future. If you can work hard, you will be rewarded. Such an environment, to me, was most ideal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then there shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. You will get rewards just by defeating monsters, surely, the challengers would work even harder now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, there could be more monster materials circulating the market. It may even become a specialty of our nation. When we have enough profit, we may even invest part of it on healthcare. Any sickness would be covered, and even if you were to be severely wounded, there could be solutions. It&rsquo;ll be just like Japan. Having a healthcare system for all citizens will be a dream no more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If such a policy was not implemented quickly after the founding of a nation, it would seem very unfair to the people. Because of this possibility, we should enact it as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The recognition of citizenship also posed a problem. The challengers of the labyrinth, travelling merchants, these people were all not citizens. They should try to register as citizens now to get their rights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this time, the Tempest Federation was still developing. That&rsquo;s why we welcomed immigrants. But perhaps once our nation matured, we may even come down against immigration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The so-called nation, at its core, is just a massive mutual assistance organization. People can&rsquo;t live on their own, that&rsquo;s why they form communal groups to help each other out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why we didn&rsquo;t want any parasites in this nation. Neither did we want to accept people with no will of staying. It would be difficult to assimilate people with different ideologies to the same group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you possess citizenship to a nation, you are obligated to contribute to the nation. That was also why you get to enjoy the rights for serving the nation. Those who do not belong to any nation, they won&rsquo;t have to afford any duty and they can roam freely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t the one making the choice. It was up to the people visiting Tempest. If they were willing to submit their loyalty to the Tempest Federation, I welcomed them. Otherwise, they were guests. We wouldn&rsquo;t be able to provide the same welfare that the citizens received, that needed to be distinguished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It seemed that I </span><span class="c4">need</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to discuss the matter in detail with Rigurd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;And things along those lines, for once I was actually pondering over things seriously.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was in the midst of my thoughts, Masayuki wanted to speak to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it true? If that&rsquo;s the case, we can actually mix in unidentified potions, or weapons and gear that have unknown effects. Shouldn&rsquo;t we do that so that people won&rsquo;t be able to identify which ones are the truly high-valued items?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Oh yeah. We are in the middle of a meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I quickly considered Masayuki&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I see, I get what he meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could it be? Are you making it so that they won&rsquo;t be able to use the items unless they appraise them at the counter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That said, most people probably won&rsquo;t drink unidentified potion anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps some people would. We can mix it with poison. It can be considered as a form of trap. It can be a good reminder for people to remember doing appraisal. We gotta put it into practice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cursed type equipment could prove to be an interesting challenge, but magic weapons may also be interesting. They would probably think it&rsquo;s trash at first, but their true quality can only be revealed after appraisal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! You can&rsquo;t even toss away random trash, you have to leave the labyrinth to do the appraisal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I began to discuss all these video game ideas with Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most surprisingly, an idea that we can implement was forming. We began to get excited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing our conversations, Ramiris and Veldora also got a giddy look on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you want them to hide their true forms, you can use my &lsquo;Illusion Magic&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAHAHAHA, I&rsquo;m getting worked up just thinking about the troubled and confused looks on those challengers. Looks like I&rsquo;m gonna have plenty of fun in the future!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These two seemed highly motivated as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, hmm. Trash gear is gonna take up their valuable space, so you will have to go back to town to sell them. I somehow feel like sales of the &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo; are gonna take off,&rdquo; Myourmiles expressed this practical view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing his words, that did seem to be the case. It would certainly make people feel reluctant if they had to throw away unidentified weapons or armors&mdash;it would definitely trouble people who liked to roam the labyrinth for good items once such an idea was put into practice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every time they entered the labyrinth, it would also charge them an entry fee. The increase in the number of entries would also bring up the profit margin. After all, we wouldn&rsquo;t be the only one having fun now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unidentified&mdash;how charming does that sound? Bearing the excitement of waiting for the result of the appraisal, that was quite fun in itself. Your brain&rsquo;s gonna explode out of excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What you thought was garbage turned out to be a treasure. In this way, even if it really was trash, people would still value it a lot. I didn&rsquo;t think we needed to put in too many big prizes. Instead, we could increase the drop rate of the low healing potions. That way, we could support the lower rank customers. We would need to adjust accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, then it&rsquo;s about time we work in that direction.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A patch update, right?&rdquo; Masayuki followed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shouldn&rsquo;t have said &ldquo;about time,&rdquo; I did just acknowledge his idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said, &ldquo;patch update&rdquo; was a great term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice way to put it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris nodded along, as if she understood everything that was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Oi. Did you really get all that</span><span class="c1">&mdash;with that message in mind, I turned to her, but she immediately averted her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like she was just playing along with the atmosphere. This gal only knew petty tricks like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles gave off an evil grin, Veldora burst out in laughter as he always did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We looked at each other and nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moving on to the next evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was another day of serious work. I have been patrolling the town during the day&mdash;definitely not idling around for fun, absolutely not. I had also been listening to reports at night. The location was my office.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the paperwork was handled by Rigurd, though some important matters would only be approved by me personally. I had someone prepare rooms in the duty hall to handle these.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, here are the reports submitted by Myourmiles-dono,&rdquo; Shion said as she handed me a bundle of paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had been working hard. It&rsquo;s like she was an actual secretary now. I was a bit surprised by her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">Um</span><span class="c1">, good work,&rdquo; I said in my most lord-like manner before taking the reports from Shion&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed to be the outline based on yesterday&rsquo;s meeting. Myourmiles got the documents ready at lightning fast speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like everything is going smoothly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly good news,&rdquo; Diablo nodded in agreement after hearing my mutter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The sales in the bars have gone up ten percent lately. Looks like the lower rank challengers have been making profits. It&rsquo;s good for the townsfolk as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Everything is going just as Rimuru-sama has predicted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Agreeing to my words, Diablo gently served me some black tea. It wasn&rsquo;t actually </span><span class="c4">because I had some amazing foresight, but I was nonetheless pleased </span><span class="c1">to see that things had been working as planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo always portrayed me too positively. But, even if they were just meant to be complimentary, they sounded quite nice to my ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took a sip of the black tea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ehh? It doesn&rsquo;t taste the same as the usual one, did you change the tea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it not to your liking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the case&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, it&rsquo;s not bad. But the bitterness tasted stronger than usual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I shall change it for you at once!&rdquo; Shion suddenly said in a tizzy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that really wouldn&#39;t be necessary. It wasn&rsquo;t bad at all, in fact, quite delicious.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image17.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Shion&#39;s tea version 2, and the subverted expectations"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Was it because black tea made by Shuna has always been too good or&mdash;wait a second, could it be?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could this be&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, number one secretary-dono insisted on preparing it herself. I&rsquo;ve tested it for poison, it is perfectly fine to drink.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">O-okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a surprise. I never expected black tea made by Shion to be so tasty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, I was surprised that Diablo was willing to help her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to assist Shion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Poison wouldn&rsquo;t work on me. Diablo&rsquo;s supposed poison test must have been a taste test, which was even more surprising.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Benimaru-dono has been pushed to his limit having done taste tests every day. I supposed I was forced to do it. Thanks to this, I was able to experience feeling &ldquo;unwell&rdquo; for the first time. I suppose you have to be adventurous in life,&rdquo; Diablo replied with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought such an experience would be unnecessary, but I did need to thank him this time for cheering up Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, Shion had really come a long way. Although meals made by her were more deadly than a lethal dose of poison, I never expected her to make black tea without her Skill&hellip; Her violin performance during the concert was amazing as well. She had been a constant source of surprises lately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I was deeply grateful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo, thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are too kind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And Shion, great job. You have really been trying your best!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! Thank you for your praise!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Shion&rsquo;s turn to pour me a second cup of tea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While it was still kind of bitter, I was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It then suddenly occurred to me that I had yet to give Diablo his reward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh yeah, I forgot about your reward. You magnificently captured Farmus, and you&rsquo;ve also helped out so much with all these tasks back here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, I merely wish to be of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s aid&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if you say so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had given Hakurou a vacation. He was now joyfully training with his daughter Momiji.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Gobta, I took him to the elven cabaret located on level ninety-five, which was only available to special guests. It was too early to give him his own VIP badge. I wanted to bait Gobta with this and have him do more favors for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although, he was currently abducted by Milim&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora said he wanted to train Gobta, but that would just be too cruel. I hope he won&rsquo;t do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Gabil, I rewarded him with a new research facility located at the deepest, one hundredth floor, behind the gate guarded by Veldora. Gabil was the acting director, while Vesta was the vice director. We had gotten more researchers as well; things were progressing very smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">My other lieutenants received their appropriate rewards as well, yet Diablo, my </span><span class="c4">closest</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;lieutenant, had not been given anything. I simply couldn&rsquo;t let that stand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I actually have a request; I hope my master may approve it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was worried about it, Diablo opened up saying this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can only say that his ability to read the atmosphere was truly impressive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then speak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes sir, please indulge me. I hope you may grant me permission to recruit some subordinates to help manage miscellaneous tasks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, you mean like preparing tea and stuff?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So he really did hate being the errand boy. That made sense though. Why would a powerful demon like Diablo be willing to serve tea for a slime? Even I found that strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ah, no, not that. To me, </span><span class="c4">attending to Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;every need in life is a very important job! So instead of that, they will be handling trivial tasks such as destroying nations and other chores along that line. I hope to find some subordinates that can handle these things for me. In this way, I can always be by Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; Diablo explained with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">&hellip;Oi oi, what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">HOW IS THAT ANY TRIVIAL MATTER? THOSE SOUNDED LIKE VERY IMPORTANT MATTERS!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to Diablo, it seemed like the job of taking care of me was more important than waging wars against other nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had no clue what was going on in his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see how it is. But to have someone that has the power to do such tasks to be your subordinate just seems&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This way, there would only be Benimaru or Souei when I needed to find someone who was both intelligent and capable to take on a nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really would&rsquo;ve loved to grant Diablo&rsquo;s wish, but it just wasn&rsquo;t in the cards. However, it seemed that I was making up these worries myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No no no, I don&rsquo;t intend to overtake Benimaru-dono&rsquo;s status in </span><span class="c4">any way</span><span class="c1">. I have old friends that are capable enough to fulfill the role. I plan to try and invite them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, so he was trying to find some subordinates outside our nation. Then there wouldn&rsquo;t be any problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then that should be fine, do you need any funding?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">You gotta spend money recruiting people, right?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I asked upon thinking so, yet Diablo rejected the idea with a grin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, they are not interested in such things as money. In reality, I require something else. That&rsquo;s why I hope you may prepare some bodies for them to possess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Oh, I get it now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These old friends of Diablo were probably demons as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well, will the type of body I gave to Beretta suffice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he wanted human corpses, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to prepare those. Unlike when I summoned Diablo, things were very different now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It will suffice. I will make sure they don&rsquo;t complain about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">That&rsquo;s reassuring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It happened so that Ramiris wanted me to prepare bodies for Treyni-san&rsquo;s sisters. She said that they would be assisting the upkeep of the labyrinth, therefore I agreed to her request. I might as well just make a couple of extra bodies when I finished making those.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to know, but is it really the only reward you want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. However, regarding the people I wish to recruit, I recall they each have their own subordinates as well. I was thinking about recruiting them as well, may I do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was confident as always.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with how he put it, it sounded like he had predicted that they wouldn&rsquo;t be refusing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t be paying any salaries, is it really okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If my lord is willing to grant them bodies, I am sure they will all be happy to pledge their loyalty to Rimuru-sama!&rdquo; Diablo said conclusively, without a shred of doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that was the case, there was nothing more I wanted to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I would have to clarify some questions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, how many people are you recruiting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Diablo&rsquo;s words, there seemed to be more than one person. Since I was crafting bodies for them, I had to confirm this first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, at most a couple hundred people. And if I have to push it, there won&rsquo;t be more than one thousand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so many!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">What do you mean at most not more than one thousand?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Were they all demons as well? Just how strong would they be!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you trying to start a war all by yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, I don&rsquo;t think they will fight me. Even if they do, it won&rsquo;t be a hard fight,&rdquo; Diablo answered casually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where did this guy get his nerves of steel?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it really gonna be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I understand that their number is big. I will dispose of those who are not needed&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&#39;s not what I meant! I&rsquo;m asking if you are gonna be okay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo smiled happily hearing my question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Diablo asserting that conclusion, I felt like an idiot for worrying here. Diablo may actually have been stronger than me. If someone like him said it&rsquo;s okay, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be saying anything more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I shall prepare one thousand avatar bodies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Would it be alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a reward anyway. Just remember to be careful when you are out. Don&rsquo;t get hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like there was no need for me to worry, yet I still felt the need to mention it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo looked very grateful and bowed to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, while I feel extremely saddened to leave you, please allow me to depart from Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s side temporarily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then bid me farewell in a more than dramatic fashion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really felt like just playing dumb to get over the matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll handle the rest, just go now,&rdquo; Shion said, almost as if she were chasing away a hindrance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could sort of understand Shion. Surely she felt the same as me.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost as if saying &ldquo;Better tomorrow than today,&rdquo; Diablo seemed eager to go on the journey as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, having Shion as my only secretary was sort of concerning. But if anything were to happen, there was also Shuna to stand in as well. There shouldn&rsquo;t be anything that&rsquo;s gonna give me a headache, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Upon thinking so, I saw Diablo off with a smile.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Give"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.z56wcint54ph"><span class="c22 c4">Chapter 2</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c26 c4">The Bustling Daily Life</span></p><hr><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c26 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Several days passed since our last meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was finally someone who managed to break through level thirty&mdash;it was Masayuki&rsquo;s party. Just as we&rsquo;d discussed with Myourmiles, their conquest was progressing smoothly. Although this was a complete sham, as long as we don&rsquo;t get caught, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Since Masayuki had the Unique Skill &lsquo;Chosen One&rsquo;, even if we slipped up a bit, others would still receive the outcome with a positive spin all on their own. He really was the ideal guy to handle public relations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inside the labyrinth, the defeat of the thirtieth floor&rsquo;s Level Boss, the Crazed Ogre King and his five subordinates, was announced with great fanfare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could say it worked well. Loud cheers erupted among crowds of people gathered in the inns and bars. &ldquo;Ma~sa~yu~ki, Ma~sa~yu~ki!!&rdquo; chants filled the town with a joyful atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki responded to those cheers with a smile. His expression was strained, but in the eyes of the audience, it was the most brilliant smile they could imagine. Masayuki&rsquo;s fame was steadily rising, and his popularity was far from hitting its limit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking advantage of that situation, there were stores with something like &lsquo;Hero Masayuki-sama&rsquo;s thirtieth floor conquest commemoration sale&rsquo; and the merchants&rsquo; eyes were glowing with excitement. Along with that, the town became even more lively&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We gathered in the conference room within the labyrinth again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara, you seem quite popular, &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo; Masayuki-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on, Rimuru-san, please stop teasing me. You&rsquo;re giving me a hard time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only meant as a simple greeting, though Masayuki seemed to be genuinely troubled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, you showed spectacular valor in those amazing battles. I was deeply moved as well!&rdquo; Myourmiles joined in the conversation, and it sounded genuine, to which Masayuki could only respond with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see. </span><span class="c1">No wonder he would get tired seeing this type of reaction all the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But to be honest, I barely did anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here we go again&hellip; You have an outstanding sense of humility, Masayuki-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki was probably telling the truth as opposed to being humble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Ogre King was a monster that fell under Rank B+, and his subordinates were each Rank B as well. Even one Rank B monster alone could drive a small village to the verge of extinction. With such a troupe of strong enemies to face off against, it took some genuine strength in order to make it through level thirty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Nevertheless, Masayuki&rsquo;s group succeeded with little difficulty. Jinrai&rsquo;s defense went up by equipping the mithril</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;full plate armor I gifted to him. Thanks to that, apparently it became a viable strategy to use him as bait. Maybe because the other members were fairly skilled too, they were able to focus on offense and use powerful magic. Bonnie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Elemental Magic&rsquo;, Jiu&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spirit Magic&rsquo;, and compensation effects from Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chosen&rsquo;&mdash;the combination of these factors had elevated the base power of their team substantially.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki claimed that he didn&rsquo;t do anything, but he was already helping them by just standing there.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And yet&hellip; This sounds weird coming from me, but the publicity has been great. In particular, the rare-grade equipment from the special series coming out of the treasure chest was very charming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? That&rsquo;s what I was thinking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you managed to collect the full set of a series, the equipment would gain a special effect&mdash;that was among the ideas that I exchanged with Kurobee. He apparently remembered and put together a prototype&mdash;that was the Ogre series.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The golden chest in the thirtieth floor&rsquo;s boss room would contain exactly one random item from this series. This was another dirty scheme.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weapon was randomly selected from among the five types: axe, sword, bow, saber, or knife. As for the armor, it could be a helmet, chestplate, gauntlets, greaves, or boots, but there weren&rsquo;t any shields available.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What you would find depended on your luck. The only certainty was that the gear would be part of the Ogre series. Therefore, whether it would be a weapon or a piece of armor, even that came down to chance. Besides, there was no guarantee that a weapon or piece of armor would drop in the first place, since the golden chest the Level Boss was guarding was set to only have a two percent chance of containing rare-grade gear. Even if you managed to bring the boss down in one hour, that totaled to opening twenty-four treasure chests in one day. By that calculation, it was fine for rare gear to show up once every two days. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was optimal to stimulate the gambling spirit. It was human nature to desire collecting things that belonged to a series, and if they happened to receive duplicates, they could always trade or sell them. With this, we could give an extra incentive to challenge the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What I got were Ogre Greaves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, you see, if you gather all five armor pieces, it will activate a powerful &lsquo;Magic Interference&rsquo; effect as magic resistance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the same effect that was on the scale shield I had gifted to Cabal. That one could activate the effect on its own, but for these you needed to gather a complete set to unlock it. That was the difference between unique-grade and rare-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To put it bluntly, the weapons and armor of the Ogre series was made from magisteel mixed with the leftover scraps we had after processing the Charybdis scales. That&rsquo;s why the magic resistance effect was pretty strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It worked against the tempest serpent&rsquo;s &lsquo;Poison Breath&rsquo; as well, so, by all means, it was worth collecting.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s why I want you to gather all of them and challenge the next boss, and hopefully that will become our game plan for the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Masayuki&rsquo;s group broke through floor thirty, the existence of the Ogre series went public, and it was only a matter of time before this information was spread around the world. With this, no doubt, the challengers would be burning with the desire to try their luck. And the sheer number of people wanting to conquer the labyrinth would rise to new heights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Parties were limited to a maximum of ten people. No matter how strong the troupe of monsters was, if the challengers managed to form a party of Rank B and above, then it wouldn&rsquo;t remain an insurmountable opponent. They might fail a few times here and there, but if you considered it as practice against a group of monsters, then this offered a great deal of experience. Like that, I hoped for them to gather powerful gear and set their gaze on the floors ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a flawless plan, and everything went according to it.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, if that&rsquo;s the intention&hellip;would it be good for me to gather that series, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a tough question. The mithril armor I gave Jinrai is equally rare-grade but has no special ability. However, it offers higher defense than the Ogre Chestplate. As it is, you probably could beat even the tempest serpent if you really pushed it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tempest serpent may have been strong, but you only needed to face one of them. If you challenged it with a party, one person could serve as bait whom you could constantly heal while fighting the monster. In their case, Jinrai would take on that role, but I was sure he&rsquo;d do just fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll head straight to the next level.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright. Your active participation has been a great advertisement, so keep up the good work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jinrai and my other colleagues are more excited than I am, though. I guess it&#39;s more fun now that the monsters drop items. Of course, finding treasure makes me happy, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monsters dropping various items&mdash;this suggestion was brilliant. Some monsters, like skeletons, didn&rsquo;t yield any usable materials, and the &lsquo;Magic Crystal&rsquo; was often of poor quality. From those, you could only earn a handful of change, so the higher the people&rsquo;s ranks were, the more of a hassle it would be to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, the situation had been flipped on its head. Those people who used to begrudgingly fight monsters out of necessity, had started to aggressively hunt them down.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c10 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The market was booming with the trade of materials, the result was truly magnificent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was surprisingly easy to make the monsters that spawned inside the labyrinth drop items. It was the dryads, headed by Treyni-san, that helped make it happen. What they did was force the newly spawned monsters to swallow items whole&mdash;putting it that way made it sound like a tough job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was difficult to know where monsters would spawn inside the labyrinth. Figuring that out was very tedious. But the truth is, that there was no need to do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The amount of magicules flowing to each floor was managed by special pipelines. We set up rooms on the fifth floor and below for these pipes to pass through. That way, we created a system where large hordes of monsters would spawn in specific rooms&mdash;these were the so-called monster rooms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Treyni-san&rsquo;s group, the labyrinth managers, distributed the items I prepared to each room, then released monsters that swallowed them. It would&rsquo;ve been a hassle to manage every monster inside the labyrinth, but when narrowed down to just the monster rooms, taking care of them was a piece of cake. Monsters that spawned in the passageways didn&rsquo;t carry any items, but we could wave that problem away by calling them blanks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like this, we were able to efficiently deploy monsters with items on each floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The way I intended it, the monster room was a kind of trap in its own right. But for now, </span><span class="c4">its</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;bigger purpose was to serve as a room that managed the monsters. Naturally, there would also be those unlucky enough to stumble into the room while it was a crowded monster den&hellip;but that, too, was a way to raise the tension. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All things considered, the alluring profits the labyrinth had in store were what everyone was fascinated by.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The appraisers are in for a treat! They receive one silver per session, yet the waiting line has no end in sight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could find fruit juice and milk with preservation magic applied to keep them fresh for several days, along with low potions, among other things. On the other hand, there were also drinks that spoiled within a few days, so appraisal was a must.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were also failed works by Kurobee&#39;s students; those garbage weapons were being sold at a low price.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might look like we were operating at a loss, but it was more like a giveaway. We could think of it as reinvesting a portion of our profit to bring in more customers. And speaking of the giveaway, there was a jackpot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Occasionally, masterworks Kurobee&rsquo;s disciples made would be mixed in. These were an absolute hit, and the number of people who showed off the special-grade gear they earned in the labyrinth increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This lavish feast had caught everyone&rsquo;s heart. Like ants attracted to sugar, they challenged the labyrinth day in and out. Items obtained from various treasure chests, prize money for breaking through every tenth floor, and loot from monsters&mdash;once the challengers got a taste for these various treats, they soon became regulars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you could see, the operation of the labyrinth was going well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inevitably, the town was bustling with activity.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The ninety-fifth floor is also thriving!&rdquo; Ramiris triumphantly announced, to which everyone happily nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, we prepared a new inn at the ninety-fifth floor, and this, too, was a smashing success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We had prominently placed a room in front of the stairs on each floor, featuring an unusual door with the word &ldquo;inn&rdquo; inscribed upon it. Next to it, there was a doorbell on the wall, wired up to call a labyrinth manager. Once summoned, they would illustrate the wonders that lay beyond the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To open it, you needed but three silver coins. It was the same cost as the labyrinth&#39;s entry fee, but for those who toiled away in continuous battles, it was a price they gladly paid. After all, most of the people who heard the pitch ended up using the service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there was a definite reason for that: The structure of the labyrinth was ever-changing. Once every two or three days the labyrinth shifted. This made any attempt at challenging the labyrinth far more difficult than it may have seemed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were very few people who didn&rsquo;t get lost within the vastness of the labyrinth, and there were countermeasures to prevent the &lsquo;Spirit Communication&rsquo; of spirit-wielders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, it became difficult to determine the shortest route. In other words, it was difficult to get to the tenth floor in just one day, forcing many to sleep within the labyrinth&rsquo;s halls.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously, this is my first time camping out in the open.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it go? It sounds quite fun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, it might be alright for you, Rimuru-san, but sleeping on the cold, hard, stone pavement not only makes it easy for you to get sick, but also makes your muscles ache. Although, aside from me and Bonnie, the other two lay down comfortably like they&rsquo;re used to it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Jiu, being a girl, didn&rsquo;t complain about camping out. However, sleeping while taking turns watching out for monster ambushes seemed to torment Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. It must&rsquo;ve been very hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say it like it&rsquo;s none of your business! I&rsquo;m not gonna sleep there again,&rdquo; Masayuki said with a grimace, likely having flashbacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For these modern kids it was apparently too much to ask. This wasn&rsquo;t only a problem among &lsquo;Otherworlders&rsquo;, but the locals had a tough time, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if you secured a room with a treasure chest and slept inside it, you would need someone to keep watch. There were also those who wandered the labyrinth without ever catching any sleep or taking a rest, so providing a place where they could relax and go to bed was highly appreciated, more than we had thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, it would&rsquo;ve been a waste to dump the gear you had earned to the wayside. This was also part of the plan, because even if it looked like useless items, there was a chance that something good might&rsquo;ve been mixed in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides that, food and bedding for several days, replacements and maintenance supplies for gear&mdash;they had to bring these necessities, setting a limit on how many of the items they found they would be able to tote along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When there was no more room to spare, the easiest thing to cut down on was food. Running out of supplies left you with no other option but turning back, however, some of the monsters were edible and could be killed for food. Water could be replenished with the use of magic, leading many to hold out with the bare minimum of rations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even in the worst case, as long as you had the &lsquo;Revival Bracelet&rsquo; you could get resurrected after death. In those cases, there was a possibility you would lose your items, but that was apparently deemed preferable to starvation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This brought the spotlight back to the &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo;, raising discussions about its usefulness, and, because you could leave with all of your items in hand, there was a great surge in purchases lately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that way, to maximize the number of items you could take, reducing the amount of food had become mainstream.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What if, in that situation, there was an inn that could be used inside the labyrinth?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Merely returning to the stairs was all it took to reach the inn. Doing so, made it redundant to carry food and bedding, allowing you to travel lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there was an inn available, it was only natural to use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A safe resting place was available for three silver coins&mdash;the same amount as the labyrinth&rsquo;s entry fee. That was triple the price of those on the surface, so it was a tad expensive, but you were also offered food. And so, with three silver in your pocket, you could use the inn and stay for a night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The building was divided up between male and female and offered only tiny areas with nothing more than a bed like in a capsule hotel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, the service wasn&rsquo;t as good as above ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The management of this place was left to the treants, and they used it as a place to train new employees. Cleaning, laundry, cooking and serving the customers. They let the inexperienced trainees get their practice here, and if they passed, they would then be allowed to work on the surface.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, the people who used it would still use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could buy safety in exchange for money, so this was no time to complain. Also, there were fancy additional services available for those who could afford it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laundry wash: three silver coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Public bath usage: three silver coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gear cleaning and repair: five silver coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were our pricey, exclusive services, and yet, there was a surprising number of customers using them. Constantly fighting in the labyrinth meant you&rsquo;d inevitably be soaked in blood and sweat. Women in particular were bothered by the smell, so baths were greatly welcomed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For that reason, we raked in a lot more revenue inside the labyrinth than above ground, and the profit margins were excessively higher to boot.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if you didn&rsquo;t use it as an inn, there were times when you just needed a place to take a break, and being able to safely use the bathroom without worry seemed to have been a major selling point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After having it pointed out by Masayuki and digging a little deeper, this seemed to have been giving everyone a hard time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were no bathrooms in the labyrinth. When side by side with death, you had to muster the determination to just let it leak if need be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no need to clean up, either, since the monsters that spawned would take care of it on their own. The slimes inside the labyrinth would eat anything and everything. Excrement, monster corpses, or debris, it was all the same to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even when those monsters were slain by the adventurers, a replacement would spawn in no time. Thanks to that, we didn&rsquo;t need to worry about cleaning up after anyone. Besides, every time the structure of the labyrinth shifted, the unnecessary trash was eliminated. And so, surprisingly, the labyrinth was always kept clean and tidy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet in spite of all that, the issue regarding toilets remained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the labyrinth management&#39;s perspective, having the whole place stink was a shitty situation. But as if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, the challengers had another problem to deal with: getting attacked by a monster at your most defenseless of times, that would likely drive anyone to tears. You could shout &ldquo;Time out!&rdquo; all you wanted, but the monsters held themselves to no such courtesies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For both numbers one and two, you&rsquo;d always need someone keeping watch. But you may feel ill at ease when quickly doing your business while your partners were protecting you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe less so when you only had to take a leak&mdash;no, definitely both would be unpleasant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now imagine monsters showing up at the same time, that would be the absolute worst time for a fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soiling your pants during combat&mdash;I don&rsquo;t even want to imagine it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that happened to you, the first impulse would be to run back to your group that very instant, but to have them see you wetting your pants before their eyes, what an absolute humiliation. A man might laugh it off, but this would, surely, be a life-or-death situation for a woman. At worst, I&rsquo;d bet some would rather choose death in those instances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mixed parties of men and women weren&rsquo;t uncommon either, so it was no surprise that the inns would see a lot of visitors, considering the toilet situation.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, there were those who took care of it with the help of some magic. They said that they managed their condition with the use of daily magic &lsquo;Health Care&rsquo; or &lsquo;Clean Wash&rsquo; within the labyrinth. &lsquo;Health Care&rsquo; was said to help you manage your bowel movements. Although there was a limit, I heard that they could hold it for about three days with no problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For everyone who didn&rsquo;t fancy wetting themselves during battle, this was said to be an essential spell. Nonetheless, one would be remiss to forget about its limit. If you planned to wander the labyrinth for a long time, relying on magic alone would be like playing shitty Russian roulette.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, even those who could cast magic, gradually used the inns as well.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As it stood, the management of the labyrinth was going very smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles gave the income report with a gleeful look on his whole face, &ldquo;Things are going smoothly, ladies and gentlemen. Revenue has been steadily climbing. Even after deducting the necessary expenses, such as the loot items distributed in the labyrinth, we are still making enough profit. As for the return on our investment, we&rsquo;re currently at around ten percent. We are aiming for twenty percent, and seeing as the number of users increases, I predict we will be able to achieve it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Hmm Hmm, everything is roughly as expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The loot was valued at its market selling price in these calculations, not the raw production costs, meaning that the real profit margin was even higher. Not only that, but the residents working in the city were not being paid a single copper, letting all of the money flow straight into the state treasury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s alright to increase my investments.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If we do that, we might have to wait a while before the country becomes profitable, but it would not take long to be in the black.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If all we wanted was to turn a profit, we could&rsquo;ve simply sold goods we produced at a high price, but that alone didn&rsquo;t make us a legitimate nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were people engaged in various jobs around town, and only when the work was appropriately divided, could everyone do their best. Therefore, I thought it to be important to create an environment where everyone could work with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Work for every citizen of this country&mdash;in other words, it was my job as king to offer them a worthwhile life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;That being said, I didn&rsquo;t think it was good to continue the status quo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, you know, not getting paid is a bit&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In fact, our funds are sufficient to cover paying everyone a salary equivalent to the average salary in the kingdom of Blumund. It&rsquo;s just that people haven&rsquo;t taken it&hellip;&rdquo; Myourmiles said with a bitter smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a merchant, it would be out of the question for Myourmiles to work free of charge. It was a feeling I could deeply sympathize with. Going without a paycheck was a glaring issue on so many levels. We guaranteed food, clothing and housing, and everyone seemed to be happy with that, and yet&hellip; This was verging on outright exploitation, so it was about time to pay them what they were owed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was thinking about it, but Raphael-san was perfectly managing it for me. And probably thanks to that, there weren&rsquo;t any complaints piling up. There would have to be discussions about the matter with Rigurd and the other three officials.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While the residents were satisfied despite the lack of pay, there were those who were true to their desires.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-then there won&rsquo;t be an issue with my paycheck, right?&rdquo; Ramiris asked with a gulp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With all of that talk about withholding wages, she seemed to be worried that her share was gone too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a man of my word; such worries were uncalled for. So, I signaled to Myourmiles with a glance. In response, Myourmiles grinned and nodded vigorously, followed by a pompous announcement, &ldquo;You may have high expectations! Mark my words, we will pay you handsomely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris wore a broad grin on her face after hearing that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s finally here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? What is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The time, the age! My era has finally come!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I wonder</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c4 c8">I don&rsquo;t think such an era has come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris laughed with a shrill voice while saying that. Treyni came by to bring her tea and had the same joyful expression&hellip; She seemed a bit overprotective and heavy on the love&hellip; but that wasn&rsquo;t any of my business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of paychecks, don&rsquo;t I get one too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Annoyingly enough, Veldora had also awoken an interest in money. I figured this was the time to pay up. Myourmiles glanced at me, and I returned a slight nod.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, we have it prepared. Would you agree to receive the same amount as Ramiris-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a matter of fact, I had already discussed this with Myourmiles. After all, Veldora was employed as the king of this labyrinth. It may have looked like he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything, but we were actually relying on Veldora&rsquo;s leaking magicules to maintain the environment of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning iron ore into magisteel alone already drove major profits. So, I didn&rsquo;t want to be stingy and thought that it would be right to properly compensate them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Ohhh! Is that so? As expected of Rimuru. I can feel relieved knowing you&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste it on unnecessary things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, of course not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of, of course! I know what saving is, too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Knowing something didn&rsquo;t mean much if you didn&rsquo;t put it into action. That&rsquo;s what I thought, but I didn&rsquo;t want to rain on their parade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, no harm in spending some. You gotta feel the joy of spending it first to appreciate the effort of saving it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right?! Myourmiles-chan, you know that well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Myourmiles, if you pamper Ramiris she will get carried away. I&rsquo;d hope you see Treyni-san as a bad example and learn from it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What of it? I also have experience working at the takoyaki shop. I understand the value of working and the importance of money. Rimuru, you worry too much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">What&rsquo;s with your smug attitude? It was me who set up the takoyaki shop, and it was Myourmiles who actually did the work. You were just frying takoyaki!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would have liked to lash out, but I got a grip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, you live and you learn. Let the two of them do as they wish. Even if they failed, they could learn something from it, and that&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew that the town was flourishing, but I wondered what the internal situation was really like. I was concerned about that, so I decided to pose the question, &ldquo;By the way, Myourmiles-kun, how are things going outside the labyrinth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles&rsquo;s face lit up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lively&mdash;that one word says it all. The festival has already ended but I don&rsquo;t see a big change in the population. It is safe to assume that the merchants are now on a steady stream.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, does that mean that this town has started to become a trading hub?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The merchants looking to do business have begun to pay me visits. Not all of them were coming through connections, so Rigurd-dono seems to have been busy handling correspondences. Ranging from those affiliated with the Freedom Association to wealthy merchants in Western countries, inquiries about opening a shop have been stacking up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That seemed to be going more smoothly than I had thought. We succeeded in bringing people over with the Tempest Debut Festival as the spark. On top of that, the labyrinth that we created for fun enjoyed surging popularity and was able to win the hearts and minds of visitors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that&rsquo;s left was to direct the money into a smooth flow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We let those who challenged the labyrinth earn money and consume our country&#39;s goods. Products included not only lodging and meals but also weapons, armor, and supplies. Naturally, merchants from other countries would also play a part there. The Freedom Association would buy up the monster materials and pour money back into our country. Merchants from foreign lands would bring various kinds of rare goods. By the time that happened, the town would be bustling with activity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the meantime, our country would earn a reputation for the excellent products made here. We had a wide selection of local specialties to offer, many of them were culinary ingredients and alcohol, along with the countless dishes Shuna developed with them. There were also various kinds of weapons and armor made in Kurobee&#39;s workshop. Now that several of Kaijin&rsquo;s disciples were working together, a variety of products were available. There were many other things too, but I was sure there would be more yet to come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It spread by word of mouth, and even without putting much effort into advertising the product, customers would surely come. And as a result, this country was bound to become recognized and required by many.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But wait, there&rsquo;s more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of the gear that came from Kurobee&#39;s workshop was displayed in markets as this city&rsquo;s specialty product. The armaments traded there would also attract a lot of attention. They were sold by different shops depending on the quality, but high-performance equipment could be bought if you had the right amount of cash. Though, when it came to rare-grade and above equipment, I only planned to exhibit it on the ninety-fifth floor of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some might question its performance, but that wasn&#39;t a big deal. After all, there was a place close by where you could try out the products you bought. There were still only a handful of people using this service, but we did offer rental gear for challengers as well. And it would only be a matter of time before news of how great the quality of the products was, would spread on its own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, little by little, the trust in this country piled up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Credibility was more important than profit. I didn&#39;t think that we had to run a deficit to gain credibility, but if we are in the black overall, we could call it a success. Our goal was not to make money, but to get this country recognized on the world stage.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is as we expected. The merchants still approach in spite of Tempest being a kingdom of monsters, because they can smell the profits. The number of challengers continues to grow, and it seems we have an opportunity to get along with the Western Nations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Accepting my wishes, Myourmiles nodded as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem. The number of customers is increasing steadily. This is with the knowledge that this is a monster country ruled by a demon lord. We can safely assume that we&#39;ve gained credibility, just as Rimuru-sama intended,&rdquo; he agreed emphatically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, Myourmiles was a really interesting man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">&ldquo;We,&rdquo; huh? </span><span class="c1">From that statement, you could tell that even though he was a human, his thought process was entirely from our perspective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That does put a smile on my face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Credibility is not something you can earn at the drop of a hat. As they say, trust is a fragile thing&mdash;hard to gain but easy to lose. Few words were truer than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although we attracted people by stimulating their desires, it was another matter to gain their trust. If they regarded us as someone who satisfied their desires, that meant you had gained their trust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles is a good example, we were bound by a trusting relationship built upon desire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Do a good job and reap the proper benefits&mdash;I believed this to be important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, pursuing your desires one-sidedly is an unpleasant way to go about it. You must look deeply into a person&rsquo;s character to gauge if they&rsquo;re worthy of trust. This was the perfect time to hone that very skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Myourmiles as the teacher, there was still lots for me to learn.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">After that, I gave Ramiris and Veldora their pay; the two of them looked happy. I </span><span class="c4 c8">did</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;tell them not to waste it, </span><span class="c15 c4 c8">but do they even think about what they&rsquo;re buying?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite these doubts, the discussion carried on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that the labyrinth was on track, I was thinking about devoting myself to the things I loved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The research facility, which was newly prepared on the one hundredth floor, was divided into several compartments. At present we had laboratories headed by Gabil and facilities where Ramiris conducted her personal research.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, could you prepare a facility for me as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine, but are you going to do some research as well, Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, in my case, it&#39;s development. I&#39;ve got a lot of things on my mind, so I thought I&#39;d make them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it came to research, Kurobee was working much more diligently than I was. His workshop was located in the southwest part of the city, and the surrounding area was lined with the workshops of disciples who were recognized as master craftsmen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was said that some artisans who heard the rumors had taken up residence there, and some even opened their own workshops. These people were also repairing equipment, and now it was a kind of industrial area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, the technology developed there was nigh impossible to hide. This was a place where everyone could share and learn from each other in a friendly competition&mdash;that was no place to conduct confidential research and development.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I asked Kurobee was to make armor and technical stuff, which no one else could feasibly imitate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, I didn&#39;t need the space to do any research, all thanks to Raphael-sensei. That&#39;s why I wanted a place to set up the development, based on the diagrams I had completed in my brain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay! I&#39;ll have it ready for you today!&rdquo; Ramiris readily agreed to my request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, the lowest level, the one hundredth floor underground, the one that began as the great hall of Veldora, became a large space with various research facilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Viewing it from the perspective of defense as well as leak prevention, there was no better place that felt more secure. It was truly impregnable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From now on, important projects would be carried out in this location.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Rimuru, just what are you trying to make?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? You always make the strangest things, so I&rsquo;m quite curious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. There should be no secrets between you and me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">What nonsense&hellip; Ramiris and Veldora are always up to something behind my back. But when it comes to this, these two are persistent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Deceiving them was even more of a hassle, so I decided to give them a proper answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about bodies. I&rsquo;m planning to make one Treyni-san&rsquo;s sisters could use.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In truth, I was thinking about preparing the quantity Diablo had requested as well. When it came to amounts around one thousand, making them by hand would&#39;ve been a herculean task. With this in mind, I wanted a facility capable of mass production.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Make it big; I have quite a lot of things I want to try out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Alright. Since it&rsquo;s for </span><span class="c4 c8">my subordinate</span><span class="c1">, I&rsquo;ll do what I can to help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Putting an emphasis on the subordinate part, Ramiris accepted my request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Hee hee, it was right to only give half of the truth. With this, I&rsquo;ll be able to experiment to my heart&rsquo;s content.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until now, the idea was just floating in my head, without the spare time to make it happen. Finally, I could dive into developing it. I grinned at the thought.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A couple more days passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was engrossed in installing the equipment for the development. I could finally get to work after looking forward to this for a long time, and incorporated Raphael-san&rsquo;s input as it replicated a bunch of stuff in my &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If these had been bits of technology that were meant to be passed </span><span class="c4">on to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;future generations, I would never have done things the way I did. But I didn&rsquo;t intend to share this tech with the public in the first place, so I didn&rsquo;t restrain myself and created whatever I wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then that someone called for me from outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">And just when I thought that I was beginning to be productive</span><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. You have been cut off from outside communication for several days. Something might have happened.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Raphael-san had pointed it out, I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t even eating anything. I was too absorbed in what I was doing, and I didn&rsquo;t realize that until Raphael-san stepped in to make me aware of it. Even if nothing happened, Shuna and Shion would have been worried about me, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It just so happened that my work was done for now, </span><span class="c15 c4 c8">I guess it&rsquo;s time for me to show up for a change.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c15 c4 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I answered the call and stepped outside the R&amp;D facility. It was indeed Shuna and Shion on the other side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, is everything alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was worried sick. You always looked forward to dining, yet you haven&rsquo;t shown up for mealtime in the past few days. We were just wondering if something had happened to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">They really </span><span class="c4 c8">were</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;worrying about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, I got a little too focused here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s alright! As long as you are fine&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shion is right. You have always been working hard. And even if Rimuru-sama acts more free-spiritedly, people won&rsquo;t really complain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Knowing that I was alright, Shion and Shuna smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I need to seriously reflect on myself for having them worried this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From today onward, I will show up every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will be very happy if you would do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I suppose. I really need to stop getting carried away with my interests. </span><span class="c1">But merely knowing that someone was worried about me cheered me up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Halfway through my introspection, Shion suddenly recalled something and began to mutter: &ldquo;Speaking of which, Myourmiles-san has been looking for Rimuru-sama since yesterday.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that was the case, couldn&rsquo;t you just come and find me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We did, but you weren&rsquo;t responding&hellip; Sorry, we should have shouted a bit louder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s okay. I was the one at fault. It&rsquo;s all because I got lost in thought. I will prepare something like a call bell for such occasions in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that Shion didn&rsquo;t think it was anything urgent, but seeing that Myourmiles was still looking for me to that day, she became anxious and went to discuss it with Shuna. Moreover, Shion further mentioned that what Myourmiles wanted to talk about had to do with the labyrinth, yet he didn&rsquo;t tell her the details.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Did he feel that she wouldn&#39;t understand or was it something that he couldn&rsquo;t tell Shion</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Myourmiles&rsquo;s thoughts were intriguing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, Diablo may have been more qualified than I had expected. In times like this, Diablo would have definitely come to call me out. He might&rsquo;ve gone so far as to just come in by himself. Now that I think about it, Diablo was probably even more stubborn than Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">But let&rsquo;s put that thought aside. I should go find Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna made me some packed sandwiches, and Shion made me some black tea.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While enjoying my food, I waited for Myourmiles&rsquo;s arrival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, Rimuru-sama! I&rsquo;ve been looking for you. Something terrible has happened!&rdquo; Myourmiles burst out in panic before me, quite unlike my own casual attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, what happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Did we get complaints from customers?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I thought as I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There have been other people who made it through level thirty, after Masayuki-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s impressive. They are progressing faster than I expected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s not the time for such idle chit chat! They are progressing at lightning speed and are already approaching the fortieth floor&rsquo;s boss room!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Woah, wow-wow.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Indeed, now wasn&rsquo;t the time for chilling. But I didn&rsquo;t think such panic was warranted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon coming to that conclusion, what Myourmiles said next changed my mind on the matter, &ldquo;Their strategy is bordering on foul-play, moving in grey areas that could potentially violate the labyrinth rules. For instance&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so on and so forth, Myourmiles continued without pause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, this was unexpected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like these people were good at using Ramiris&rsquo;s items.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, before they went to fight the floor guardian of level twenty, they used an &lsquo;Event Recording Globe&rsquo;. This item applied to a full squad, so even if they were to fail in their conquest of the Level Boss, they could still respawn at the save point that they registered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of those item uses were in line with my expectations. This on its own was fine, but, on top of that, they were also using a &lsquo;Return Whistle&rsquo; to leave the labyrinth as a squad. Following that, they would disband the squad and then each member would find additional teammates to form a new squad, with a maximum number of ten members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, this way the total number would be&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. These are no longer just a couple squads, their size is more comparable to a small army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With ten squads in total, that added up to one hundred challengers. Every single one of them boasted a strength of at least Rank C+ to B+. I heard that they were also wearing the same type of jacket embroidered with some sort of symbol. All of these people grouped together in style. Almost as if they were trying to show everyone else how &ldquo;strong&rdquo; they were, they marched onward through the labyrinth. And of course, it was said that all members had appeared before the guardian of level thirty. The people challenging the Level Boss were also divided into squads, ten in total, each of them taking turns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Crazed Ogre King and his five subordinates were a powerful company, but those challengers weren&rsquo;t rookies either. And in the end, even though it was a tough battle, these people still made it through level thirty with their third squad of challengers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t something similar happen lately?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your Majesty has sharp senses, their group was the &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see, of course they were behind it. </span><span class="c4">Wearing the same type of jacket with the same symbols. Were they sent by some noblemen? Considering how often these people were using an &lsquo;Event Recording Globe&rsquo;, I couldn&rsquo;t help but shiver. </span><span class="c15 c4 c8">Well, the saying goes, &ldquo;Time is money&rdquo;&mdash;but to simply use a disposable item that costs as much as one gold coin without a flinch&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did that symbol reveal what noble house they belong to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I asked Souka-san to investigate. They seemed to be a famous mercenary group known as the &lsquo;Apostles of Vert&rsquo;. Their sponsors seem to come from the Ingracia Kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">&lsquo;Apostles of Vert&rsquo;, never heard of them. </span><span class="c1">On the other hand, the central kingdom of the Western Nations was suddenly interested in the labyrinth in our nation&mdash;this was a lot more surprising to me. During the Debut Festival, there seemed to be nobles from lower houses in attendance&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t suppose there were any from the royal house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Did they fear letting someone get ahead of them? Or were they up to something else</span><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How should I put it, I suppose&hellip; The attitude they had, essentially that money makes the mare go, left a sour taste in people&rsquo;s mouths. Nevertheless, they weren&rsquo;t violating any rules.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was giving us a headache, was that we had no reason to kick them out. I could understand why Myourmiles was nervous. At this point, there was really nothing we could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are profiting from it, so there&rsquo;s really nothing to complain about. But these people will probably tear through the floors designed by Rimuru-sama&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, during my shut-in period, Myourmiles wanted to see me because he was afraid that these people would conquer the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take a look at yourself, you&rsquo;re shaken to the bone. It shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. After all, what lies beneath level forty is the real deal. Getting there still won&rsquo;t be a cake walk though, beating the tempest serpent is no small feat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The squad &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; displayed immaculate teamwork, so, if I had to guess, that team had the strength equivalent of Rank A-. Although I still had my doubts, considering their individual strength was only Rank B. They would probably be unable to resist a powerful area attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tempest serpent was very powerful among the Rank A- monsters. So, it should take more than ten B+ members to defeat it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, according to Ramiris-sama and Veldora-sama, the captain of the team &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; appears to have lied about his actual abilities&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Eh!? From footage alone, I can&rsquo;t really run an accurate &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo;, but</span><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. Applying &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; on battle footage alone cannot calculate the magicule content of the target.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the advice Raphael-san gave me. We could solely analyze the video footage and infer the equivalent monster (adventurer) ranking established by the Freedom Association. But we were unable to calculate the team&rsquo;s absolute level of ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For instance, my registered rank was B+, yet my actual ability was at Rank S. That&rsquo;s just how it was, sometimes your true level of ability didn&rsquo;t match up with your ranking. Moreover, it was even more difficult to tell when someone was faking it. This would be something I needed to figure out countermeasures for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to hear what Veldora and the others have to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me. I&rsquo;ve already contacted all of them. Let&rsquo;s talk in some other place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected from Myourmiles. Looks like the moment I left the room, he had already contacted Veldora and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded and stood up from my seat.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everyone gathered in the meeting room inside the labyrinth&mdash;the usual guys, of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were so slow, Rimuru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right! You are the captain, you know, gotta do better than this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I&rsquo;m the captain? First time I&rsquo;ve heard of it. But that&rsquo;s not the point now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, what&rsquo;s the current situation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gotten really dire. They have already made their way to level thirty-eight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris rendered the raider&rsquo;s progress into video footage as she spoke. She looked distraught and flustered as she worked to visualize the situation. It was like a bunch of tiny models moving around in a transparent box. They were extremely delicate 3D projections.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">If only I could use this to perform a direct &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo;&hellip;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&mdash;Proposal. If permission to interfere with the individual Ramiris&rsquo;s Intrinsic Skill &lsquo;Labyrinth Creation&rsquo; is granted, more accurate intelligence could be extracted.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Oh oh, it was rare of Raphael-san to suggest something. It looked like it was worth a try, </span><span class="c4 c8">let&rsquo;s ask her right away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ramiris-kun, may I ask you a favor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? Why are you getting so serious all of a sudden?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The thing is, I want to interfere with your &lsquo;Labyrinth Creation&rsquo;, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interfere? How are you going to interfere with it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if you asked me&mdash;I certainly had no clue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By interfere I mean interfere. I just want to collect all sorts of information from the labyrinth, I guess?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I casually threw out some contrived nonsense in an attempt to bamboozle Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. That was basically it.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Hoho, I am a genius after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that I correctly interpreted Raphael-sensei&rsquo;s idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess you may, but can you endure all that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, me? Why are you worrying about me now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Not really, but the thing is, that the amount of information within my labyrinth is huge. </span><span class="c4">Even I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can&rsquo;t grasp all of it, that&rsquo;s why I usually just delete most of that stuff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Uh-huh, wait a minute? </span><span class="c1">An immense amount of information&mdash;just like she pointed out, it was indeed filled to the brim. There were already more than a thousand challengers using the labyrinth at that very moment, in addition to the many items on various floors, not to mention the residents on level ninety-five. And all of this would be handled by&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. No problem.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Ah, yeah. No problemo indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh&hellip;no&hellip;problem&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you sound like you&rsquo;re full of doubt?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, you don&rsquo;t have to pursue it, Ramiris. Just go ahead and hand the matters to Rimuru. No more need to worry about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t even sure about it myself, before Ramiris was suddenly convinced by Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I got it! Then I&rsquo;ll give Rimuru the access to interfere with my &lsquo;Labyrinth Creation&rsquo;!&rdquo; Ramiris declared and reached out to touch me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, I was easily connected to the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. Established connection with the Intrinsic Skill &lsquo;Labyrinth Creation&rsquo; of individual &lsquo;Ramiris&rsquo;. Proceeding to gather intelligence.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if it was already on the edge of its seat, Raphael-san launched its operation. And in that same instant, it felt as though a tidal wave of information flooded into my brain&mdash;though it had no ill effect on my body. I had tensed up in anticipation, yet it was all for nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Report. &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; of team &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; has concluded. The captain&rsquo;s abilities exceed Rank A. The analysis of the remaining members deviates by a negligible amount from the previous appraisal.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It looked like Raphael-san was able to get the necessary information in a moment&rsquo;s notice. What a reliable sensei indeed. But for some reason, Raphael-san seemed to be continuing its &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo;, </span><span class="c4 c8">was there something else on its mind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Currently analyzing all on-going battles within the labyrinth&mdash;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt like I was being told to stay out of the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right. Ordinary men such as I had not the faintest idea of what Raphael-sensei was up to. I believed it must&rsquo;ve been doing something really rad again, so I let it do its thing undisturbed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of which, let&rsquo;s get back on track.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you see, Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was fast, so he really couldn&rsquo;t handle it&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring Veldora&rsquo;s usual demeanor, Ramiris was gazing at me with doubt in her eyes. Although she had good reason to do so, I was slightly offended, and, therefore, declared my discovery with a slice of arrogance: &ldquo;That guy looks to be above Rank A.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I presented footage that was quite unlike the feed displayed by Ramiris and continued to enlarge the images.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;EH!&rdquo; Everyone seemed surprised, but Ramiris was the one that was hit the hardest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-hold up, Rimuru? How did you figure out how to use my Skill?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, after you gave me access to interfere, I just suddenly learned how to use it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No way! </span><span class="c4">Even I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can only broadcast specific locations and people that I&rsquo;ve checked on before&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, Ramiris could only project images that the labyrinth managers could see. No wonder why it was difficult to verify intelligence in detail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, don&rsquo;t be a stranger. I&rsquo;m just good at this type of thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While pacifying Ramiris by saying that, I turned my eyes to the projector.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of the person above Rank A, he was the captain of the team &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;, a spirit-wielder. Given how much power he had been hiding, surely, he would be able to utilize many spirits. If this guy was capable of wielding greater spirits, his power would definitely have stood to increase many times over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so the &lsquo;above Rank A&rsquo; you said was in comparison to the ranking of monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s the standard set by the Freedom Association in order to determine which people of a certain rank can defeat what type of monster.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet they never considered the relative safety of such a battle. In my memory, stipulated by the association&rsquo;s rules, multiple adventurers were to confront a monster of the same rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then what rank is my team?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys, let me see&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s rank was a tad ambiguous. Honestly, I thought that he would still be considered a Rank D loser. But Masayuki&rsquo;s Unique Skill was ridiculously over-the-top, so the whole team may easily have added up to beyond Rank A. But saying this directly to Masayuki could easily be misunderstood, so I should save it for another time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, it was best to try and make something up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Jinrai barely made it to Rank A. Although I&rsquo;m unsure whether he can defeat the tempest serpent alone, but it </span><span class="c4">should</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;be a piece of cake if he had the ogre series.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not even mithril full plate armor could completely protect one against &lsquo;Poison Fog&rsquo;, making the tempest serpent a tough enemy for him. Unlike monsters, humans had all kinds of weaknesses. This was, of course, no video game; the possession of resistance could be a matter of life and death. Despite being on equal footing in terms of strength, one can easily succumb to a lethal dose of poison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jinrai sure is impressive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he? However, a lot of that is due to your Skill buffing Jinrai&rsquo;s abilities through the roof. Aren&rsquo;t the rest of your comrades a girl, named Jiu, and Bonnie? Both of them are also Rank A-.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A very balanced and strong team. This was probably the reason why Masayuki was never shown in a bad light before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All thanks to my reliable teammates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, Masayuki-sama must be stronger than all of his companions. I think he can be easily evaluated as above Rank A. Since you are, after all, the &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo; recognized by Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles gazed at Masayuki with admiration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Please don&rsquo;t act like that</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki was torn between laughing and crying again because of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the problem: not only was this one member of the &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; that strong, the guy next to him is also Rank A. They are the mercenary group &lsquo;Apostles of Vert&rsquo;, right? Seems like an organization with many skilled warriors.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way! Where did all of these elites come from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, to me they&rsquo;re still pushovers, but&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After putting some thought into it, I figured that, if these people were to team up, they could have easily broken through level fifty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gozer and Mezer are both Rank A. But it may be too much for either of them to handle these two people at once. Moreover, that captain of &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; seems to rival Gozer and Mezer in strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is he really that strong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. By the way, those two guys are also twice as strong as Jinrai. This is ignoring techniques however, a purely physical comparison.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two guys, approaching the strength to rival the captain, were also powerful enough to stand against greater majins. Right now, they seemed to be weaker than our ol&rsquo; pal Gelmud, though stronger than the lesser skilled Holy Knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The captain of &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; stood head and shoulders above the rest, and although this is my assumption, he was more experienced in combat as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even the traps I specifically set for them were taken out by the beasts they summoned. These people are good at this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, if this were to continue, they will eventually end up on the floor I prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How terrible, it will be bad if this continues.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought those two would have been happier, were they worrying about something? I was pretty pissed by the fact that my own traps were getting thwarted, but, by all accounts, these two should&rsquo;ve been looking forward to challengers. Moreover, since a short while ago, Ramiris&rsquo;s face had been filled with panic; were they hiding something from me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there something you aren&rsquo;t telling me?&rdquo; I asked straight up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And soon, Veldora and Ramiris turned to look at each other, before Ramiris seemingly decided to be straight with me and began to talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The thing is, during the three days you stayed in your room&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And following the things that came out of her mouth, my head began to hurt as I listened.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">According to Ramiris, the Holy Knight Order had begun their training. They started from level fifty-one. Level fifty-one to sixty were trapped by Ramiris, and she was excited to see the results.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman, who had been appointed as the guardian of the sixtieth floor, had summoned hordes of undead monsters. As a result, Ramiris created ferocious traps, such as hallways filled with endlessly respawning waves of the undead, or entire rooms devoid of oxygen, something undead monsters had no use for anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was quite confident in those traps! But they were easily purified by the Holy Knights. The oxygen-free room got the better of them, but the people following immediately came to their rescue, reviving them&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They were a direct counter to one another, that can&rsquo;t really be helped,&rdquo; I said to comfort a dejected Ramiris as I continued to listen to her report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Holy Knight Order made its way to the boss room of level sixty. Adalman was waiting there but was also beaten to a pulp by his opponents. I had come to expect that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After losing his power, he became a mere wight. I could only hope for him to be of use as a summoner, because the Holy Knights were too much for him alone to handle. Be that as it may, Adalman should&rsquo;ve been considered a senpai to the Holy Knights. Getting beaten by his juniors was enough to dishearten even a dead man&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was he really frustrated about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Super frustrated&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Ah yeah, of course. I should go comfort him later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, what happened next?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After they beat Adalman, they continued onward to the floors I trapped myself. I was gonna enjoy a show, thinking that they would be faced with a tough battle&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The infuriating part is that all of Mentor&#39;s traps were evaded as well! The sliding floors, illusory walls, pitch black hallways, light beams of death, and many more I can&rsquo;t even think of, were all overcome by them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris gritted their teeth in frustration as they gave their reports.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora prepared floors sixty-one to seventy with a lot of care. Although there were casualties among the Holy Knight Order, those who weren&rsquo;t immediately killed were promptly revived. Moreover, with the &lsquo;Revival Bracelet&rsquo;, the Holy Knights weren&rsquo;t particularly concerned about the dangers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here I thought that the difficulty had been set too high&hellip; It seemed that any squads of soldiers above Rank A could recover as long as one of them was left standing. Now we really had to re-evaluate and re-adjust the difficulty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But my golem guardian</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;worked really hard. After improving upon the one you broke, my new one is super strong, and it killed all the challengers. However&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Very impressive. </span><span class="c1">It was able to take out all of the Holy Knights; it packed one hell of a punch. Though, that really was to be expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its abilities alone were a threat. It could shrug off both swords and magic, coupled with its massive size, yet agile motion&mdash;this wasn&rsquo;t an opponent any average person could take on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">But if it&rsquo;s that strong, then why is Ramiris so upset&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, one of the valiant members of the Holy Knights said something that was pretty embarrassing to Hinata-sama. Probably out of spite, one of the challengers, Fritz-sama, commented: &lsquo;I think even Hinata-sama would fail at conquering this labyrinth,&rsquo;&rdquo; Myourmiles answered my doubt with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I see, had Hinata been part of the force, even the guardian golem wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to stop her. I should ask&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, how far did Hinata get&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the main problem!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was shocked after hearing what happened&mdash;Hinata made it to level ninety-five on her first day. Although she started from level sixty-one, this was still extremely fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She easily immobilized the golem guardian and instantly destroyed it using &lsquo;Disintegration&rsquo;. And then she made her way down to level eighty in one go and easily took care of the floor guardian there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My disciple </span><span class="c4">Zegion</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was in a cocoon at the time; he was in no condition to move. Apito had already awoken though and was there to face her. Yet that woman, Hinata, was too quick for Apito to react, and defeated her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She was really strong. Apito is a queen wasp, after all. Her speed is unmatched among all monsters. Apito tried her best fighting Hinata, but even with that speed, her every move was seen through by that woman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Thicc Apito getting abused by Hinata"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Yeah, well. This was Hinata, she could certainly pull that off. </span><span class="c1">I already found it pretty incredible to have won against her. That was how strong Hinata was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From there, that woman continued to make great strides. All of Kumara&rsquo;s subordinates guarding levels eighty-one to eighty-nine were defeated by her one by one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moreover, since Kumara is still young, we let Beretta stand in as the Level Boss of the ninetieth floor, but he didn&rsquo;t stand a chance, either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; Beretta does seem to have become stronger than before, but such an opponent was still too challenging for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm-hmm, Hinata is so incredibly strong, it makes me wonder why she isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard that Hinata had spent that night very elegantly on the ninety-fifth floor. And yesterday, she broke through level ninety-six to ninety-nine in one go&mdash;the supposedly super-tough dragon&rsquo;s dens that Milim was proud of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, on the terrain effect levels, there are not only earthquakes, there is also heavy gravity! It&rsquo;s been cranked up to five times the normal strength; you&rsquo;re supposed to have a hard time moving around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lightning strikes from above, icy winds that freeze you to the bone, burning heat that scorches your skin&mdash;none of this left a mark on Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And in the end, at last, it was my turn to fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously? Did you actually fight her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep, as the king of the labyrinth, I welcome all challengers. As the final boss, I will neither run nor hide!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;And, how&rsquo;d it go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Veldora wouldn&rsquo;t run or hide. But apart from that, I was more concerned about the result. Veldora was stronger than me, so the thought of him losing didn&rsquo;t even cross my mind. Rather, I was curious about how Hinata had fought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I won. She was really strong though. Her swordsmanship was very similar to the &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo; that sealed me, yet her fighting style was the opposite.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Hmm-hmm. </span><span class="c1">It came as no surprise that Veldora won, but it was a shame that I didn&rsquo;t get to see the fight play out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ah ah, I really hope there are at least some records left&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Unfortunately, all combat records were deleted.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I see&hellip; Darn it, I&rsquo;m such an idiot for missing something so important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But seriously, the fight was mesmerizing. As expected from Hinata-sama, she put up an amazing fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Did Myourmiles get to see it? I&rsquo;m jealous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinata-san sure was strong&hellip; Even though everyone argues over which one of us is stronger, to be honest, I feel sick every time I hear such a conversation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wahahaha, how modest of you, Masayuki-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Myourmiles-kun&hellip;that&rsquo;s not modesty, it&rsquo;s nothing more than his honest feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, please stop joking like that, Myourmiles-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki tried to play dumb with a rigid smile hung on his face. Yet Myourmiles kept on singing his praises, not realizing Masayuki&rsquo;s desperation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, I see. Surely, you must be saying that this is no casual matter to discuss. Indeed, if Masayuki-sama and Veldora-sama were truly to fight, it would undoubtedly be a battle on a scale yet unseen by man. Please allow me to watch when the time comes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Usually, Myourmiles was good at reading people&rsquo;s thoughts, yet under such circumstances, his moronic antics were pushing Masayuki to the brink.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Please stop. </span><span class="c4 c8">Masayuki&rsquo;s dying</span><span class="c15 c4 c8">&nbsp;over there!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I see. Masayuki, you wanna play around a bit with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c8">Playing around a bit</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;</span><span class="c4 c8">&nbsp;with you will cost Masayuki&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, don&rsquo;t get so hasty. Masayuki is strong, but he mainly relies on his head during battle. If we really had to fight, I&rsquo;d probably have the upper hand. That&rsquo;s why, you know, he won&rsquo;t be able to match up against the invincible Veldora!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see! That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d guessed anyway. As expected from Rimuru, you really get me. GA-HAHAHA!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Phew, this will do. It&rsquo;s all because you let it go straight to your head when anyone praises you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your conclusion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">First, it&rsquo;s time to hear what Veldora has to say. </span><span class="c1">Having made up my mind, I turned to Veldora. He nodded with an &ldquo;Umm&rdquo; before continuing his speech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, yeah, the &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo; who managed to seal me didn&rsquo;t throw out any unnecessary attacks. By contrast, this woman called Hinata tried out a series of different attacks to see which ones would be effective against me. That being said, she was just as calm and cautious, but Hinata did heaps of unnecessary stuff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Veldora, Hinata tried out a variety of attacks. She utilized all sorts of magic, spells, magic tools, and even magic artifacts. No expense was spared in their battle. Any purely physical attacks were ineffective against Veldora. That&rsquo;s why Hinata probably ran a number of tests to see which attacks had an impact. But in the end, none of Hinata&rsquo;s attacks amounted to much of anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;By the way, her last attack was pretty good. For just a moment, she managed to hurt me. It was something similar to </span><span class="c4">the &lsquo;</span><span class="c4">Absolute Severance&rsquo; of </span><span class="c4">the &lsquo;</span><span class="c1">Chosen Hero&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Veldora was praising was probably her &lsquo;Melt Slash&rsquo;. I figured that it was likely Hinata&rsquo;s trump card. She even went so far as to sacrifice her moonlight rapier in order to execute this deadly attack. Yet, even so, she still couldn&rsquo;t hurt Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Considering her fighting style, will she pose a threat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh&mdash;it&rsquo;s certain that she&rsquo;s stronger than Clayman and the other poser demon lords. Even members of the Eight Star Demon Lords may find themselves in danger, should they be careless. But Mentor is something else&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAHAHA, of course! She&rsquo;ll need at least ten times more magicules to even stand a chance against me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see&hellip; </span><span class="c1">Even Hinata was outmatched by Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Aaah, how I would&rsquo;ve loved to have seen that fight. It would&rsquo;ve been useful for future reference, had it been recorded permanently. Never mind, it&rsquo;s too late for that now</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c15 c4 c8">Let the past rest, it&rsquo;s time to get back on track.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I get it. In other words, because of the whole ordeal with the Holy Knights and Hinata, all the levels below fifty-one are now out of commission? But hey, wouldn&rsquo;t the Level Boss have revived, nonetheless?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, wasn&rsquo;t Adalman weaker than Gozer? He helps me out with research, and I think he&rsquo;s outstanding and all, but as the Level Boss of the sixtieth floor, he&rsquo;s not exactly dependable. Besides&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Ramiris began to tremble&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;M-my masterpiece, the guardian golem&hellip;was broken&hellip; It didn&rsquo;t revive!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She broke down into tears as she finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Wasn&rsquo;t it a Level Boss as well?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you forget to equip it with a bracelet or something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no, it was the same when you destroyed it,&rdquo; Ramiris said in a huff. &ldquo;For some reason, golems just won&rsquo;t revive&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard that it was possible to revive naturally spawning golems, but the ones created by Ramiris would not. Hearing that made me think of something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps it had to do with the lack of a soul. After all, Beretta can be revived. Is it possible that the guardian golem was considered to be an item?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, that&rsquo;s very likely. Ramiris, could the reason why your Skill did not apply be that the golem was outside its effect?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora added in agreement, so I was probably right. In other words, even if she were to make another one, there&rsquo;s still a chance that it would get broken again. The Guardian Golem was strong though, so it was unlikely for it to get destroyed often. That said, we still needed to figure something out. But before that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It takes a long time to make that thing, doesn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no boss on level seventy&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Also, Zegion, on level eighty, will need to sleep for a bit longer. Apito has grown stronger as well, but her combat experience is lacking. If she is planning to be a Level Boss, I think she will need more training.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">According to Veldora, he seemed to have given Apito some combat training. </span><span class="c4 c8">So, he&rsquo;s heading in that direction?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Although I personally had doubts concerning the matter, because Veldora seemed highly motivated, I&rsquo;d let them have their way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, her instructor was Hinata. Apparently, using the rematch with Veldora as bait, he had asked Hinata to mentor Apito. Hinata was already tutoring the kids, she must&rsquo;ve been willing to instruct Apito as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was also Kumara. Levels eighty-one through eighty-nine were guarded by Kumara&rsquo;s subordinates. Those majins were all generated using Kumara&rsquo;s tails, each of them possessed free will and could evolve and learn independently. Due to the release of all her subordinates, Kumara&rsquo;s own magicule content decreased drastically. She, alongside Chloe, Alice, and the others, would be studying under Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;As of yesterday, that&#39;s what had been decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, all of the Level Bosses from levels sixty to ninety are gone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, that&rsquo;s why we were troubled!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, Ramiris and Veldora both looked rather smug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The timing is just horrible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Myourmiles and Masayuki were both shocked by the current state of affairs within the labyrinth. </span><span class="c4 c8">And I thought that there was room for slacks</span><span class="c1">&mdash;looks like I was too naive once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I got the gist of things,&rdquo; I sighed, feeling rather powerless.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was the perfect storm of bad news. But on the bright side, we were able to identify the issues of the levels below fifty-one. Moreover, all the traps I laid were still there. Our focus should be on the levels below forty-one, or rather, focus on levels below forty-nine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before the tempest serpent gets beaten. But we don&rsquo;t need to worry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, as expected from Rimuru. Have you already come up with a solution?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. We don&rsquo;t have to worry as long as you&rsquo;re around!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my words, Veldora and Ramiris&rsquo;s distress seemed to have vanished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded to the two snobs and expressed my ideas, &ldquo;Listen carefully now. As I&rsquo;ve just said, I&rsquo;ve put all the kick-ass traps below level forty-one. Those intruders will have a bad time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh&hellip;that sounds so reassuring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho&mdash;I see, I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Rimuru, what kinds of traps did you plant there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Hehe, you wanna know? I&rsquo;ll tell you then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The ultimate trap I had prepared on level forty-nine is slime. After passing into certain hallways, there is a mechanism to isolate people. And that&rsquo;s when a bunch of slimes will appear. Those fellows are a pain in the ass to deal with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A large amount of slime would gush forth and coalesce, forming a giant slime that was over three meters thick. The path forward as well as backward would be blocked, trapping the challengers like fish in a barrel. None of the physical attacks, neither slashing, beating, nor ramming would work on the slimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a tightly sealed hallway, the magic at their disposal would be limited as well. Explosive spells were out of the question because they would probably just end up blowing themselves up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although individual slimes posed no threat, they would all slowly move in to attack. And considering that the challengers would be cornered, this started to shape up as a significant threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAHAHAHA! Now we definitely will win!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh-huh, it&rsquo;s our win for sure&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You two are so naive. I&rsquo;ve got many other tricks lined up as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too early to get excited about the concept of my traps alone. There were still a ton of other traps to go over. Hear all about them and shiver in fear!</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_7413un7mlkqg-0 start"><li class="c2 c28"><span class="c1">Slime Pool: Although it appears to be a soft-feeling passage at first glance, it is actually a slime. About halfway through, it&rsquo;ll suddenly show its true colors.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c3 c41"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_7413un7mlkqg-0"><li class="c2 c28"><span class="c1">Slime Rain: Fist-sized slimes rain down from above. They will also try to sneak into the openings in your clothes. Watch out for their acidic burn.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c3 c41"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_7413un7mlkqg-0"><li class="c2 c28"><span class="c1">Slime Doll: At first glance it looks like a monster. But it won&rsquo;t get tired after sustaining consecutive attacks from its enemies. It will slowly exhaust the opponents&rsquo; stamina. The more terrifying aspect of it, is that it will splatter strong acid on the enemies&rsquo; weapons every time it is attacked. Watch out for your weapons&rsquo; durability.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so on and so forth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There were other traps as well, but all of them were installed with the intent of staggering the enemies&mdash;especially the ones aimed at destroying challengers&rsquo; weapons. </span><span class="c4 c8">Surely, it would be difficult for them to continue fighting after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the very least it could help us buy some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Amazing. Those traps sounded amazing. So, you were saying that we don&rsquo;t need to rely on the traps to take out the enemies directly, but instead only harming them slightly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea, Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. Without weapons, no matter how strong they are, they will probably be intimidated. That&rsquo;s when we can break them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s best to just defeat them straight away, but we can figure out something else if that doesn&rsquo;t work. Right now, we can at least get some more time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like this time my traps&rsquo; only purpose was to stall for time. Although that was a bit disappointing, we can use the time we earned to think of a countermeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then what will you do with the extra time you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Veldora asked, I decided to answer seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What we should not forget is that our labyrinth is different from the normal one. An advanced labyrinth should be strengthened by overcoming various problems, shouldn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;UH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, of course we should.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then we just need to improve until we can handle the challengers next time. First, we need to deal with Adalman. I&rsquo;ll figure something out for him. I also want to change the environment on the boss levels, for which I&rsquo;ll need Ramiris&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was a cardinal, if I recalled correctly, his role was the archbishop. Strictly speaking, he was supposed to be the support type. It was a mistake to let him be the Level Boss alone, what we should&rsquo;ve done was finding him a partner to act as the vanguard. Besides, I had some ideas of my own. I&rsquo;d find Adalman and Ramiris later.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next was the Level Boss on floor seventy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Regarding the Guardian Golem, we have no choice but to make a new one. Luckily, it just so happens that the perfect man for the job has returned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had prepared the materials and planned to rebuild it. But it would&rsquo;ve been boring to make the same golem as last time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The perfect man?&rdquo; Ramiris asked with doubt in her voice, to which I nodded in return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kaijin is back. That guy has a hand for spirit engineering; he would be happy to help. Moreover, the experiment that I&rsquo;ve been running might also be of help, so I&rsquo;ll be handing over my research results. You can look forward to the new and improved version of the golem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Really? That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though he won&rsquo;t be able to produce the outcome immediately, Kaijin would definitely prove to be a big help. Even in the event that we didn&rsquo;t have enough time to finish it this time, its completion would, nonetheless, be a threat to future challengers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And regarding level eighty and below&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think the problems will resolve themselves with enough time. When Zegion awakes, none of the amateur challengers will be able to hurt him. There are also the dragons prepared by Milim, they will probably evolve after staying in the labyrinth for a while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kumara was still growing as well, so there was no need to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One question remained: how much extra time could we salvage?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, our plan is settled. All we need to do now, is to buy ourselves time. We can&rsquo;t simply rely on my traps alone. There&rsquo;s one thing I want to try out, and I&rsquo;ll need Veldora and Ramiris&rsquo;s help for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; &ldquo;I got it!&rdquo; the two of them agreed happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded and turned to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Masayuki, you should resume your conquest. Your secondary objective is to break through level forty-one and below, but right now you&rsquo;d best try to collect a complete ogre-set.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. With Masayuki-sama&rsquo;s conquest, it will serve as a tremendous boost to our labyrinth&rsquo;s publicity. We don&rsquo;t have to rush things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then we should just allow the others to break through level forty first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. On the contrary, you may as well stay away for the time being, lest you get caught up in our operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&#39;re up to something again, aren&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki looked at me skeptically. That really hurt my feelings. It&rsquo;s as if I was always up to no good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh, that&rsquo;s a secret. In any case, we will be taking measures accordingly from now on. You guys, Myourmiles and Masayuki, will help by just acting as you normally do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got it, I&rsquo;ll tell everyone else later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">This should do. Let&rsquo;s see just how long my traps can last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s about&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, please hold on one moment, I have something to discuss with your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was about to dismiss the meeting, Myourmiles stepped in. It looked like he still had something on his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The thing is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Myourmiles had to say surprised me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hinata-sama asked whether the prize for completing the labyrinth would be delivered or not&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but gasp. The prize she mentioned was the bait we set for the nobles. We claimed that prizes would be given to people that manage to break through every tenth floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Did Hinata want those prizes? I mean, she did pull through the levels&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even though she didn&rsquo;t conquer it on the official record, Hinata-sama said that &lsquo;Since we challenged it with just means, shouldn&rsquo;t you guys pay us?&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Myourmiles said, sounding rather troubled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That may be the case, Hinata-san. But aren&rsquo;t we in a two-way street in this regard? We got to do test runs of the levels, and the Holy Knights got to do live-fire training. So why should we pay them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Reject her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But is that really okay? Wouldn&rsquo;t she try to challenge the labyrinth seriously if we refuse her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, we can threaten her in time that &lsquo;We will make it public news that you lost to the final boss of the labyrinth&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAHAHAHA! How could I ever lose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Umm, it was times like these that you could count on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, if she seriously decided to challenge the labyrinth, we could use this for publicity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I understand. But, if possible, it is best that Rimuru-sama yourself rejects her in person&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, but I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I don&rsquo;t want to be disliked, after all. She&rsquo;s gonna be petty and I would be frustrated as well. So, this type of job should be handled by the resolute and decisive Myourmiles-kun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-but I heard that terrible things happen when Hinata-sama feels offended&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you then, Myourmiles-kun~!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I interrupted Myourmiles and concluded our conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Sorry, I don&rsquo;t want to be the buzzkill. If possible, I&rsquo;d like to be on good terms with beauties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myourmiles already had a villainous look and nerves of steel. And since he always put profit above all else, surely, he would convincingly reject her. Given this to be the case, I must&rsquo;ve been hallucinating when I heard the sad sigh of &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll use my own money to make up for it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The discussion was concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaving behind a now depressed Myourmiles, I left the venue.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I told Veldora and Ramiris when to meet up on another day. We had to get all the preparation work done before that, but there was something I wanted to deal with first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion was already waiting outside the room, so I went to find Shuna with her. Shuna seemed to be overseeing the dinner preparations and was giving all sorts of orders. There were more and more people in the kitchen, and the place was bustling with all sorts of races. Shuna was indeed an outstanding instructor to have easily managed all these people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although I didn&rsquo;t want to call her for the matter I had at hand, we were racing against time, so I made this an exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shuna, could I borrow a moment of your time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, Rimuru-sama! Please let me know what you need.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Shuna happily came to me as I called out to her. At the same time, the kitchen was in an uproar. It was rare for me to show up in person, and everyone was happy to have me taste-test all sorts of dishes. Normally I&rsquo;d give my opinion on every one of them, but today I had some urgent tasks at hand. </span><span class="c4 c8">Sorry everyone, I&rsquo;ll eat them next time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I happen to need Shuna at the moment. I&rsquo;ll come and have fun with you all next time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please do come by!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will be waiting for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our skills have all improved, you will definitely be impressed next time you visit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing me say &ldquo;Delicious&rdquo; seemed to be the equivalent of giving them a five-star review. The folks were highly motivated. I looked forward to my next visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Gobchi, I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Shuna-sama! Please count on me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobchi was now the best chef whose skill could only be rivaled by Shuna. When she wasn&rsquo;t present, Gobchi would act as the executive chef. The kitchen was left in good hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you guys on another day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After bidding the crowd of disappointed people farewell, we departed. We were headed towards level sixty of the labyrinth, the one guarded by Adalman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, thanks for the packed lunch, it was delicious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are too kind, it&rsquo;s wonderful that you liked it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thanked her for the bento as we were moving to our destination. Shuna smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, please let me prepare lunch for you next time!&rdquo; Shion volunteered herself. I thought for a moment before giving my answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose, since you&rsquo;ve grown a bit now. Maybe you can try to make lunch with Shuna next time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I figured that Shion had become more reliable nowadays. But still, I wanted to put a safety measure on top of that. With Shuna, surely, Shion wouldn&rsquo;t be able to run wild.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Shuna-sama, let&rsquo;s make it tomorrow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, alright, Shion. Let&#39;s start with the easy stuff first, please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna and Shion chatted joyfully. The two were wonderful together during the musical performance as well. They sure were close to each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we chatted, we reached level sixty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse us, Adalman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, to have Rimuru-sama come here in person! I am most regretful of the event that transpired, I shall willingly accept whatever punishment you deemed befitting for me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I called, Adalman rushed to me and dropped to his knees. Still dramatic as always, but at this point I had come to consider this the norm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it came down to our naive planning. It was too difficult for you to handle the Holy Knight Order alone as you are, your failure was understandable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;No, I can only lament my own inadequacies. My opponents were very experienced as well&hellip; Yet I resorted to my old tactics I used when I was still the wight king. I lost before I could cast even a single spell&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this time, Adalman was just a wight without power. Even though he had a wealth of arcane knowledge and combat experience, his body was still in the state of a lesser monster. The magic he could use was limited, and he could only summon lesser undead. The monsters he summoned would evolve after absorbing the magicule in the labyrinth, but it took time to do so. It was going to take a while for Adalman&rsquo;s subordinates to become powerful. What we needed to do now, was to make Adalman stronger, and fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more important that you now are aware of the extent of your strength. Since you&rsquo;ve learned that now, I have a question for you, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please, do ask.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To what extent can you use &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; was the power of faith. It didn&rsquo;t require you to concentrate the magicule in the air, nor was it bound by the amount of magicule you yourself possessed. Aside from requiring more preparation, as long as you possessed the knowledge and sufficient time to chant, you could cast grand spells at little cost to yourself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">However, the usage of &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; was limited to those who &lsquo;Have formed a pact with God&rsquo;. The &ldquo;God&rdquo;, in this sense, referred to people who could manipulate &lsquo;Spirit Particles&rsquo;, the special particles that magicules consisted of</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">. In this world, it was irrelevant whether a being became a &ldquo;God&rdquo; conceptually. Those who could interfere with &lsquo;Spirit Particles&rsquo; directly, could be considered a &ldquo;God&rdquo;. For instance, within the religion of Ruminism, Demon Lord Ruminas was the &ldquo;God&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was a fanatic follower of Ruminism. Even after becoming a monster, his faith was not shaken. That&rsquo;s why, even after becoming a wight king, he retained the ability to cast &lsquo;Disintegration&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as he lost faith in Ruminas, he instead turned towards worshipping me as his God. Perhaps now that the &lsquo;pact with god&rsquo; no longer applied, that must&rsquo;ve been why he couldn&rsquo;t use &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I have become incapable of using nearly all of my magic. As it stands, even the use of lesser magic spells escapes me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see. </span><span class="c1">&lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;, at the end of the day, was in the same vein as &lsquo;Spirit Magic&rsquo;. It depended on a pact of some sort as the user borrowed strength from a being of higher power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same applied to Hinata. She couldn&rsquo;t have used any &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; if she hadn&rsquo;t borrowed the power from Ruminas. In other words, if humans stopped relying on the Demon Lord that was known as a &ldquo;God&rdquo;, they would also lose one of the effective means to combat monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All in all, I felt that the more I knew about the matter, the scarier it got. This world might&rsquo;ve become even more chaotic if Ruminas suddenly decided to do something.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I have a question for Shuna as well, to what extent can you use &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;? Also, who did you put your faith in?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For me, technically speaking, I use it differently from &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;. I only emulated it using my Unique Skill &lsquo;Analyst&rsquo;. It worked surprisingly well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see, so she imitated the magic. </span><span class="c1">In other words, after I told her to analyze the magic barriers, she turned out to have learned how to imitate a part of &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;. Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And my faith lies in Rimuru-sama. I believe in his strength from the bottom of my heart. So, I thought that I would also be able to do it,&rdquo; Shuna said with an embarrassed smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Ah? So, during our battle, your claim that even monsters could use &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; was actually&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was a bluff. Even though I was confident, you were the one who actually proved it,&rdquo; Shuna said with the same smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Adalman&rsquo;s jaw dropped to the ground&mdash;figuratively&mdash;as he heard those words. For a skeleton, this guy had some lively expressions. </span><span class="c4 c8">Right, let&rsquo;s put that aside for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most important element in casting &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; was faith. It sounded like something similar to the soul connection ability. Shuna somehow mastered the essence of it. All she needed to do next, was to build upon and study the theories. I had a rough understanding of the matter, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I wish to bestow upon both of you &lsquo;The Ultimate Secret of Faith and Grace&rsquo;. Ruminas taught me this not long ago, and it&rsquo;s top secret. Please don&rsquo;t leak it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was already a high priest, if he were to connect with me, he would have been able to cast &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; again. Nowadays, his magicule had been reduced drastically, and with &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;, his strength could once again be greatly increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ultimate Secret of Faith and Grace&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;OH, OHOHOH&hellip; I finally get to worship a real god&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">This guy&rsquo;s still such a fanatic, but I&rsquo;ll tolerate him for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh, Rimuru-sama, is it really okay for me to know this as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I almost forgot I was in Shion&rsquo;s arms. I hadn&rsquo;t been hugged by her like this in a while&mdash;it went without saying that I was in my slime form. I felt a longing for this feeling, I wanted to stay in this state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion wouldn&rsquo;t understand my explanation anyway, so I simply told her not to spread the news, &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t tell anyone else!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing her reply so full of spirit, I was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I began to give a rough explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; In other words, if I put my faith in Rimuru-sama, I can also learn to use &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, I suppose you can. Although I hope that you can study it yourself in your spare time. You should also be Adalman&rsquo;s consultant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it as well. I don&rsquo;t know how far I can take it by studying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna was quick to understand. With her Unique Skill &lsquo;Analyst&rsquo;, she would learn &lsquo;Disintegration&rsquo; in no time. On the other hand, Adalman&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WOW, OHOH, OHOHOHOH! THE POWER, THE POWER IS COMING OUT!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was beyond excited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;HOLY CANNON!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman shouted as he thrust one hand out before him. A bright red light began to illuminate the depths of his eye sockets. A concentrated magic missile burst forth from his skelepalm. This was the Holy Magic &lsquo;Holy Cannon&rsquo;. It was invoked by the will of Adalman, with a certain power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;OHOH, GOD, MY GOD, RIMURU-SAMA&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He fell to the ground and began to worship me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s pretty spooky, please stop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-alrighty. Looks like it was a success? Let&rsquo;s keep up the good work. Go and learn some more advanced magic, and if there&rsquo;s a problem, just go ask Shuna!&rdquo; I uttered in a hurry. Shuna understood and nodded lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I see, you didn&rsquo;t want to deal with this guy, so you made me his consultant?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Since the person in question has heard it now as well, perhaps the right thing for me to do, is to pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. I&rsquo;m very dull, after all, no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about&mdash;yeah, that&rsquo;ll definitely drive her off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I will not betray your expectations&mdash;!&rdquo; Adalman proclaimed in high spirits. I then decided to ask him another important question, &ldquo;By the way, didn&rsquo;t you hurt yourself by using Holy Magic, considering you&rsquo;re a wight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Holy Magic could be divided into two types: first, to manipulate &lsquo;Spirit Particles&rsquo;, which had no elemental affinity, and second, to utilize the holy element to eliminate magicule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Holy Cannon fell under the latter category, so I thought that it would have harmed an undead monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, it did hurt a bit, but it was nothing serious&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see. </span><span class="c4">Adalman&rsquo;s sturdy backbone let him tough it out. But that didn&rsquo;t really solve the issue. If he were to have Beretta&rsquo;s Unique Skill &lsquo;Reverser&rsquo;, he could probably convert holy and demonic elements</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c1">&hellip; That would have to depend on the outcome of future research.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, he should switch up his ability for this occasion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Adalman, can you manage this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I jumped out of Shion&rsquo;s arms and cast a ray of light in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;OHOH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I excluded all the holy elements and tried to elevate the power further. This is an original spell of mine, Holy Magic &lsquo;Holy Ray&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Holy Ray&rsquo; was a magic spell that didn&rsquo;t have any element affinity. If he were to switch to using this, as long as he cast it correctly, the caster shouldn&rsquo;t be affected. However, this move was pretty difficult to perform&mdash;it would mean that he had to put even more faith into me&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though this was magic designed to tackle single opponents, its power was greater than my &lsquo;Megiddo&rsquo;. It could be fired in rapid succession at an almost blinding luminosity. So, it would appear to be like a flash of light, when, in reality, they were, in fact, small, rotating &lsquo;Spirit Particles&rsquo;. It was an attack that pierced the enemy, making it less deadly than &lsquo;Disintegration&rsquo;, in turn the time required for chanting was also reduced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Amazing, this magic is amazing!&rdquo; Adalman was overjoyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he could master this spell, he should also be able to get used to manipulating &lsquo;Spirit Particles&rsquo;. When that time came, he would be able to blast even thicker beams of light and greatly enhance their power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was one of the magic spells that I requested Raphael-sensei to develop. I figured that for Adalman, as he was right now, it would be a perfect fit for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shy, I&rsquo;ll be there to discuss anything about magic. Remember to contact me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna was ready to handle this task for me, to my relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, please work hard to practice from now on and master the &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; that won&rsquo;t harm you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sure hoped that he would put in the extra effort every day, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t end up as a pile of bones after every fight&mdash;that was my rationale behind those words of encouragement.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was dancing with glee, but I got him to calm down with a gesture, before moving on to the next problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Next, as it stands, your means of attack are still few and far between. You can gradually increase them in the future, but before that, something needs to be done first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you originally a rearguard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I had to put it in words, I suppose I mostly offered rear support for the army. When I was still a wight king, I used summoning magic to raise the undead army and win by sheer numbers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suspected as much. Since there were no such rules that limited the number of floor guardians to one, it was just a matter of finding him a vanguard, and fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. So, it was a mistake to set you up against an entire team by yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m something of a martial artist myself, but, as a skeleton, it&rsquo;s not very effective&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s hardly the problem. </span><span class="c1">This wasn&rsquo;t about his proficiency in hand to hand combat, though I think he mistook it as personal criticism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, don&rsquo;t be so self-conscious now. It&rsquo;s fine when there&rsquo;s only one opponent, but when they come in a group, you have all the right to summon companions. Didn&rsquo;t you have a companion? His name was&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, were you talking about my friend Albert?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes, that Albert-kun. He seemed to have become a skeleton swordsman now. Wasn&rsquo;t he a Templar Knight in the past? His swordsmanship even put Hakurou up to a tough fight. That&rsquo;s beyond just strong. If we prepare proper equipment for him, he could serve as a force to be reckoned with, couldn&#39;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He is an outstanding man, surely, he will be able to live up to Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s expectations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Adalman&rsquo;s proud declaration, I, too, became confident in the idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, please hand this gear to him later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took all sorts of equipment out of my &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; and laid them on the ground. I heard that Albert could fight without a shield. Then I&rsquo;d present him with this sword and armor&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cursed Sword&mdash;A bastard sword that absorbed life force from the surroundings and converted it into attack power. However, it also absorbed the life force of the user. It was a complete failure.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cursed Mail&mdash;It maintained a magic barrier that greatly raised endurance and defense against magic. However, it was, once again, a failure that absorbed the life force of the user.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were developed by both Kurobee and Garm in pursuit of raw strength. They were planning to make them into a series but discovered the flaw that no living beings could wield them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time they finished them, Kurobee, and even Garm, were exhausted. Nowadays this has become a fun tale. Nevertheless, the works they made were filled with memories, and they couldn&rsquo;t just throw them away. Moreover, if you were to look at their quality alone, they were both special-grade gear&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monsters were living beings as well, and just as we thought no one could use this gear, I realized that undead could handle them just fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about them? Do you feel any worse for wear with them on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We are already dead, so we don&rsquo;t really feel anything in particular.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I confirmed with Adalman, and it seemed to work alright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he unsheathed the sword, Shuna and Shion&rsquo;s expressions changed for the worse. This indicated that its &lsquo;Life Force Absorption&rsquo; had been activated. And even so, Adalman didn&rsquo;t seem to flinch. That should mean that undead monsters were good to go with this gear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, looks like it worked just fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman sheathed the sword and, with that, &lsquo;Life Force Absorption&rsquo; ended. Looks like even the act of unsheathing could be considered as an attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a surcoat I made with &lsquo;Sticky Steel Thread&rsquo;. It boasted impressive resistance to heat and cold as well as slashing attacks. Normally, this would&rsquo;ve been sold in our nation&rsquo;s market as a specialty with an insanely high price.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will take this. Albert will be overjoyed as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s great. </span><span class="c4">With Albert as the vanguard, Adalman would have a lot more room to perform. </span><span class="c15 c4 c8">Oh, by the way, this reminds me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Adalman, take this,&rdquo; I said, taking out a jet-black clerical robe. It looked like a dark mage robe, handsome and luxurious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the most expensive product produced in the Tempest Federation and would be sold for over a hundred gold coins. For comparison, that&rsquo;s the equivalent of a classy car. Even the royalty and noblemen from other nations would find it difficult to afford. It was super rare merchandise. Its level of quality went without saying. The cherry on top was its ability to &lsquo;Automatically Regenerate&rsquo; after being torn. It was a rare piece of magic gear that was enchanted with special abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;OH, OHOHOH&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman took it from my hands with reverence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hope you can wear this and show your prowess as a wight king facing the challengers. I think it&rsquo;s suited for a floor guardian and can create some atmosphere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, it partially came down to just being a hobby of mine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I asked for Ramiris&rsquo;s help to re-decorate the floor. We made it look like a throne room and Adalman was to be the king leading the army of undead monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just leave it to me. I&rsquo;m good at it, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adalman was quite competent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be counting on you in the future. You can also find a few powerful knights to serve as your squires.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. Then, I hope to confirm something with you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your Majesty, I wish to bring a pet of mine to this land, do I have your permission?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">A pet? Umm&mdash;sure, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, I don&rsquo;t really mind. You can have your pet join in the fight if you want. But take care to not let your total number of companions exceed the number of challengers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. The land entrusted to me by my god Rimuru-sama, I, Adalman, shall defend it with every bone in my body!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">There he goes, overreacting again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was tired of dealing with this, so I decided to ignore him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, tonight we will re-decorate your floor in the style of a throne room. You can decide the recruitment of your subordinates. Should anything else come to mind, you can find Shuna and Ramiris to discuss it with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;YES, MY LORD&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Remember Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s words by heart and work hard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion, for whatever reason, concluded the conversation, leaving Shuna at a loss for words. But since Shion looked pretty self-satisfied, I didn&rsquo;t tease her about it.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Skipping forward to the next day, we gathered at the appointed time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, Adalman&rsquo;s level has been remade to perfection!&rdquo; Ramiris proudly reported as soon as she saw me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looked like she had finished preparing the throne room last night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks. Now Adalman can actually hold his ground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it really okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um&mdash;at least he would perform better than yesterday, and the days before that. However, he may still have a hard time against Rank A opponents, but he should be able to force his opponent into revealing all their cards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Adalman were to be persistent in his pursuit, surely the enemies would be forced to show their true strength. If that were to be the case, it would be time for Raphael-san to shine. It would analyze the combat record and figure out a strategy for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we needed to do was to apply said strategy on the next level. Therefore, even if Adalman lost, it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. However, depending on how well our next operation works out, not only Adalman, even Gozer and Mezer may not have a chance to demonstrate their prowess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was better if we had multiple strategies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, we had to put them into action immediately&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the heck have you all been doing! I&rsquo;ve heard the news; did someone beat my dragons!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trouble had arrived. Milim burst into the meeting room as she roared in a furious tone. She was dragging Gobta along in one hand like a rag. Despite getting scraped across the floor, he was still breathing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, I did it&hellip; I made it through!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Gobta was babbling something incoherent, but he </span><span class="c4 c8">did</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;seem to be conscious. He probably got whipped into shape pretty hard by Milim and was utterly exhausted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">In spite of this, he didn&rsquo;t look any stronger. Although, he </span><span class="c4 c8">did</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;look like he&rsquo;d been through hell, was he alright?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring my concern, Milim nodded heavily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Gobta was great! I didn&rsquo;t expect him to survive hell mode,&rdquo; she praised Gobta with a satisfied look on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Milim, of all people, to be praising him, said a lot; surely, Gobta had achieved some goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Then I shall teach you the &lsquo;Veldora Killstreak Style</span><span class="c4 c40">TM</span><span class="c1">&rsquo; as well&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;NO WAY! Gobta is my disciple!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Completely disregarding an exhausted Gobta laying on the ground, Veldora and Milim began to argue with one another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I&rsquo;m not getting involved in this mess, let&rsquo;s see what fate had in store for Gobta. In any case, it&rsquo;s great that he has come back in one piece. I really need to reward him handsomely later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The best thing for him now was to get some good rest. Upon hearing my suggestion, Gobta immediately headed to the lounge for a nap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ranga also made it back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;M-master, I have returned,&rdquo; Ranga said, evidently exhausted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He stumbled as he slowly made his way over to me. Ranga&rsquo;s body was covered in scars just like Gobta. Their special training was clearly very intense. Ranga closed his eyes and was overjoyed while I pet his head absentmindedly.</span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Pity party for Gobta and head pats for Ranga"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You worked hard, now rest up in my shadow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before I could say another word, Ranga dove into my shadow.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something off topic:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later, once Gobta had recovered, I asked him how their training went, and he told me that it was mostly combat practice. Milim found monsters equal to or stronger than them to brawl with. Fight, repeat, and repeat some more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Gobta had mastered communicating with Ranga, they proceeded to fight Karion and Midley from dusk till dawn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim had told Gobta: &ldquo;No matter how hard you try, you can&rsquo;t increase the amount of magicule you have. But rest assured, you can work around this with your ability to unite with Ranga. It&rsquo;ll be your job to utilize this immense strength wisely later on! All you need to do is practice your skills, leave the task of increasing magicule to Ranga!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And after that, I have been receiving special training to practice my battle sense,&rdquo; Gobta said with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He also obtained Extra Skill &lsquo;Sage&rsquo; which had the ability to accelerate his thought processing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">This guy&rsquo;s going places.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well then, since Milim had come, that proved to make things significantly easier from here on out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been busy making preparations after I bid Adalman farewell last night. And, as it turned out, I managed to finish it on time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took out the items I had just completed. Veldora, Ramiris, Milim; all three of them were transfixed by the items in my hands, gazing at them with intrigue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Everyone, check this out! I have some special items here. I&rsquo;ve been working on it for a while, and it&#39;s gonna be revolutionary. It&rsquo;ll help resolve all the problems in the labyrinth </span><span class="c4 c8">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;introduce a whole new level of fun into our lives!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I finished, I handed each of them one of the items.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t expect Milim to come today, but in truth, I was going to call her when this item was put to practice. So, it all worked out, I had already prepared one for Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was inspired by the homunculus used by Duke Elalude in the past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we could replace our bodies temporarily, this opened the door for many fun opportunities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen this before; can you eat it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, in my opinion, this is something similar to a soul container.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three expressed their views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Give up already, Ramiris, you can&rsquo;t eat this. Does she think that everything I prepare is food&hellip;? Oh well, never mind.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora&rsquo;s answer was the closest. It was indeed something made to emulate a soul container. The moment that you transferred your consciousness into the body of a homunculus, you would need to cast special magic techniques in order to establish a connection to the soul. I ran an &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; on the process and modified it myself. It was the same container I gave Treyni-san, the container for the &lsquo;Chaos Core&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I officially named it &lsquo;Emulated Soul&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veldora got the closest answer. This is an emulation of a soul container. I can&rsquo;t exactly recreate something like a &lsquo;Soul&rsquo;, so I decided to settle for the next best thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so how did you make something like that?&rdquo; Veldora seemed very pleased to learn that his answer was the closest and asked me rather smugly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no need to hold back now, so I might as well just explain it. But before that, I&rsquo;d be a little dramatic. After all, it took me a lot of time and effort to make these, surely, I could shock them a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold your horses, I will explain in detail. But first, take a look at this. Hold this in your hand and picture your favorite monster before your eyes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from the &lsquo;Emulated Souls&rsquo;, I took out some black orbs and put one in everyone&rsquo;s hands. Veldora tilted his head while gazing intently at the fist-sized object in his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Anything I want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Any monster that exists. Even the crazy rare type.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Like a goblin or an orc? Can I even have a one-horned rabbit or a man-eating bear?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Sure. But just remember to pick the ones you like. Don&rsquo;t complain about not liking it after you&rsquo;ve decided.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, monsters. Are we making monsters to defeat the labyrinth challengers&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were as sharp as ever during times like these. Seemingly understanding my words, they began to draw the image in their minds.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The black orb was a &lsquo;Master Core&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c1">. In order to craft this, the magic core of Charybdis was instrumental. I isolated it in my &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; and had Raphael analyze it thoroughly. It was the &lsquo;Core&rsquo; of a large monster and the source of its power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before I became a demon lord, all of its negative energy seemed to have been consumed. That&rsquo;s why, in that moment, it was merely an empty shell. It therefore became the perfect medium for securely containing a soul. And that was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After some time, the magicule in the air gradually concentrated in the &lsquo;Master Cores&rsquo; and created monsters. All of them were the ideal forms imagined by Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about this, isn&rsquo;t it interesting? And just as Veldora said, let&rsquo;s take on the challengers using these monsters. That was the main reason why I gathered everyone here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although that wasn&rsquo;t the only reason, no one pursued the matter. The trio were deeply moved after seeing the monsters they created.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring the three of them, I also began to create my own monster. It was a floating soul that had a transparent body&mdash;a ghost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If we don&rsquo;t consider the stats, it possessed the special ability &lsquo;Physical Nullification&rsquo;. Since it was a ghost, you couldn&rsquo;t exactly hit it physically. And in turn, because it also didn&rsquo;t possess any physical means </span><span class="c4 c8">to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;attack, you could only use magic attacks yourself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next up, we have Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw a skeleton standing there, a skeleton warrior. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use magic, but perhaps it could learn how to use it in the future. Once it evolved to be a more advanced species, it could probably learn &lsquo;Qi Fighting&rsquo; as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, we have Milim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her creature had a damp, gooey body with no hands or feet, and its red color made it stand out&mdash;it was a slime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Hey</span><span class="c1">&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, why did you make a slime? Are you trying to make fun of me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, it&rsquo;s because&hellip; You wanted me to think of a monster I like. Why are you complaining?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned the table against me instead. Never mind, since she seemed to be having fun. Her eyes were glowing as she shouted &lsquo;Slime!&rsquo;. I did want to ask why it was bright red.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last but not least, Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">A knight? Hold on, is it actually a set of armor? </span><span class="c1">It was animated armor. Even though it was a full plate set of armor, for some reason, it looked woefully shabby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, among the four monsters we created, hers was the largest. My guess was that Ramiris had an inferiority complex due to her small size. That&rsquo;s why she imagined a giant monster, to compensate. Yet at the end of the day, it was all looks and nothing behind it, very much Ramiris&rsquo;s style.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone was gaping in awe at their monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there were more surprises in store for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen now, folks. As Veldora has said, we are going to use these monsters to beat the labyrinth invaders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm? Invaders&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. These monsters are guardians of the labyrinth, after all. In that sense, wouldn&rsquo;t the people coming in be invaders?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, I see how it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-how, what is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm-hm, Ramiris, we are going to stand at the front line with the labyrinth monsters. So, it would be inappropriate to still call them challengers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I get it, now that you&rsquo;ve put it this way, it would indeed sound strange.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh-huh, I thought as much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora explained in my stead to make Ramiris realize what I meant. Then there was also Milim who was pretending like she understood everything. I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether she grasped what was going, but I ought to continue the topic, nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, do you guys think it is possible to defeat the invaders using these monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, they&rsquo;re too weak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The armor I created looks really cool, but there&rsquo;s no way they can make it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, I&rsquo;m so disappointed in you. I&rsquo;ve seen this coming a mile away, these monsters are an insult to my expectations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hehehe, as I suspected, they started talking trash without a second thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">By the way, Ramiris and Milim, why are you guys acting all smug. It&rsquo;s kinda pissing me off. But since I&rsquo;m the bigger slime, I shall tolerate it for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all, just yet. What comes next is the real deal. Go take a seat and get comfortable. Then aim your &lsquo;Emulated Soul&rsquo; at your monster and shout &lsquo;Possess&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw a fair amount of skepticism in their faces, yet they still listened and sat down in a comfortable position. The chairs in the conference room were all very cozy and had exquisite cushioning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All at once, they shouted: &ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;POSSESS!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shouted along with them, and not a moment later, the &lsquo;Emulated Soul&rsquo; in our hands began to glow and was absorbed by the monsters. It then began to merge with the &lsquo;Master Core&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The possession of the &lsquo;Master Core&rsquo; was complete.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And at the same time&mdash;my consciousness faded. And soon after, the view in front of me changed. The effective range of my usual &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; decreased sharply, making me feel that my field of view had suddenly become much smaller.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By now I had simulated the five senses, so it felt much better than when I first reincarnated. However, unlike me, the other three had not experienced something like this in the past. I figured that they were going to have a hard time. With that in mind, I glanced around&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From my reduced field of vision, I could see a skeleton warrior stretching and a slime moving at abnormal speeds. There was also a set of armor going through rigid motions, looking like some shoddy, bootleg Tin Man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All three of them sporting their new appearances, each had successfully &lsquo;possessed&rsquo; the monsters they created.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="The spoopy four assemble"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, I could feel myself settling in. It felt more natural than I expected, as if I was just controlling my own body. But my abilities were greatly curbed, so moving around wasn&rsquo;t really smooth. Then again, once I got to know the ghost&rsquo;s movement, it became very easy to react to things. And soon enough I got to move as I pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed to be no different for the other three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;THIS IS AWESOME!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo; the trio shouted in sync, after spending some time to confirm the conditions of their new bodies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? How do you like the result of my research?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing, truly amazing, Rimuru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru, is awesome! I knew you weren&rsquo;t a simple guy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was right, after all. I knew I was right to place my confidence in you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">These guys change their tune on a dime. But seeing how happy they look, it&rsquo;s truly great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, looks like it was a success. What should we do now that we are transferred to these monsters&hellip; Don&rsquo;t need to spell it out for you guys now, do I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, what a silly question. You didn&rsquo;t want to leave it up to the monsters and hoped that we would duke it out ourselves. What an interesting idea you have, Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I&rsquo;m super pumped to start my own conquest of the labyrinth in this form, though&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. I get it now; this is a game!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? Is this true, Veldora?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mentor! Then can we defeat enemies with this body? And perhaps make this body evolve as well&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected from Veldora. He saw right through me. Yep, I was imitating an MMORPG, a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. Although, this wasn&rsquo;t exactly on a large scale, so I suppose it wasn&rsquo;t really an MMO, but more like an MO?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never mind, that&rsquo;s not important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing was that we wanted to have some fun in the labyrinth that we went through all the effort to build. That&rsquo;s the whole point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, you sure know your stuff, Veldora. You saw right through me so easily. But don&rsquo;t get the wrong idea. I did develop this in order to enjoy playing this game, but don&rsquo;t we have other things to take care of before that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;GAHAHAHA, are you talking about that thing? So, are we supposed to use these bodies to take care of the challenger problem&mdash;no, to defend against the invaders?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Looks like he got what I meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, I planned to use the monster body&mdash;monster avatar&mdash;to sabotage the rapidly progressing team &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like what Ramiris said before, I was considering different ways we could have fun, like leveling up the bodies and learning how to fight with these inconvenient bodies that had many limitations compared to our original ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My true intention was for us to be able to get some fun out of defeating monsters and challengers. I never thought it would come in handy in this way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, once we&rsquo;ve done enough preparations, I plan to use it purely to experience the fun of challenging the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, that way we can also try out our own labyrinth, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I meant. Moreover, we can&rsquo;t really show our true strength using this monster avatar. That means we can alter our perspective and see what problems the labyrinth has.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, you&rsquo;re right. After all, if I were to confront the challengers in the field, my authority as the king of the labyrinth would come into question. If I were, however, to possess some fragile monster&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes! No longer as a &lsquo;Demon Lord&rsquo; or &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;, but as a monster that can unabashedly fight the invaders in the open.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I get it, that sounds like fun!&rdquo; Milim chimed in, fully on board.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Switching to a new, inconvenient body with all of its limitations probably felt fresh and exciting to her, seeing as she normally did as she pleased while flaunting her power. She seemed thrilled and intrigued by the concept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, before we start the game properly, let&rsquo;s clear out the trash and make the place pretty again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Time to show my moves off. I&rsquo;ve been itching to test out my forty-eight ultra-instinct kill moves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although I&rsquo;m not feeling myself in this, I&rsquo;m still tempted to try things out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We set off, filled with motivation. Now it was up to us to take care of the troublesome team &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; and make them no longer capable of challenging the lower floors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to achieve this goal&mdash;I had come up with an even more devious plan.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our first order of business was to get familiar with our monster avatars. The second important step was gearing up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were equipped with &lsquo;Revival Bracelets&rsquo; that suffered from no usage limits, allowing us to resurrect, no matter how many times we died in a row. But that alone would not be enough, as our monster avatars were just recently created and were still low-tier monsters. Right now, we were nothing more than a couple of chumps, and no matter what we did, we could not harm members of &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if we were to somehow become equipped with some high-grade gear&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Next up, it&rsquo;s important for us to get armed. Let&rsquo;s go find Kurobee and ask him to make us some weapons and armor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, I see! If we were to continue as we are, right now, I&rsquo;d be nothing more than a rickety skeleton.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, you fools! My body is a slime, the agile extraordinaire! I&rsquo;m goo-d to go with what I got!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry if this is a dumb question, but if I&rsquo;m a set of armor&hellip; Can I still wear armor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who knows? Perhaps you can make it work? Let&rsquo;s take a look first. Milim doesn&rsquo;t need any weapons, so please stay and keep watch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;W-what kind of nonsense! Of course, I </span><span class="c4 c8">could</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;stick with what I have now, but I still want to gear up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">How stubborn, why didn&rsquo;t you just say that from the start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, I wanted some gear too. So, I temporarily broke out of &lsquo;Possession&rsquo; and prepared to head out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you want to get back to your original form, just utter &lsquo;Exit&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll be able to return to your bodies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I demonstrated the exit method to them and taught them how to store their &lsquo;Avatar Core&rsquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Avatar Core&rsquo; would only record monsters created at a prior point in time. One core corresponded to one monster, and you could not change its owner. This item represented everyone&rsquo;s core, so I reminded them to take good care of it. Thus, I gave further clarification, &ldquo;With this, you can also call upon your avatar whenever you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is amazing. But when we do use &lsquo;Possession&rsquo;, we should think about where to place our original body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris had reverted to their original forms and stood up from their seats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To make sure we don&rsquo;t lose it, how about we seal it in the bracelet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I was gonna do that as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She began to stroke the orb&mdash;&lsquo;Avatar Core&rsquo;&mdash;happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d have someone work on the bracelet as well. By the way, what was Milim doing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, Mili&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in this form!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without letting me finish, Milim, still in her slime form, jumped into my arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; she protested, fully prepared to ignore everyone&rsquo;s words, and had the scene under her control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like she really adored the avatar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s kind of childish&hellip; But, welp, she&rsquo;s a kid, after all. </span><span class="c1">You can&rsquo;t reason with kids about how childish they are. I decided to give up and began to walk away.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We arrived at Kurobee&rsquo;s workshop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you there, Kurobee?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh oh, is it Rimuru-sama? What can I do for you today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I called, Kurobee came out to welcome us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing that Veldora and Ramiris were with me too, he looked quite surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm,&rdquo; I said as we walked into the workshop, &ldquo;I wanted to take some weapons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been a while since I was last there, the number of people in the workshop had increased&mdash;including monsters. And it was still as hot as ever. I wasn&rsquo;t affected by temperature though, so it didn&rsquo;t matter to me. But it looked like working here was quite the hardship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;ve gotten more disciples.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, thanks to your Majesty. Although they still have a long way to go, there are still many talented individuals among our ranks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We toured around the workshop as we chatted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The disciples looked up at the sound of my voice and, seeing me, stood up in unison and saluted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was somewhat taken aback, but Kurobee had gotten used to it at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop! Get back to work,&rdquo; he bellowed and forced the disciples to carry on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I could relate to how they felt. It was like when a top executive went to visit the average joe&rsquo;s workplace. People would get nervous. Moreover, the lower on the chain of command, the more nervous the staff would feel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the example doesn&rsquo;t entirely line up with the situation at hand, in this nation, I was the king. I didn&rsquo;t really pay attention to such things in the past, but now it was probably better for me to send someone in advance to inform them about such a visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surely, it would concern people if I were to just drop by at random like this. In the company of my original world, if someone such as a general manager were to come around and visit, we would launch an office clean-up the day before and make preparations etc. If the person visiting were to be the director of the company, we would have prepared the office in a way that gave the impression that no failure was tolerated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The higher the status the visitor was, the more casual they tended to behave, which in turn made us at the bottom put too much thought into preparations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that being said&hellip; I sincerely hoped they wouldn&rsquo;t prepare something dramatic every time just because of me. It also made me feel bad to suddenly call Kurobee while he was busy, so next time I&rsquo;d be sure to come during off-hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry to barge in on you,&rdquo; I announced to the room, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be dropping in this sporadically in the future, no need to be so nervous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may cause a problem if they acted too familiar with me, but there wasn&rsquo;t a need to be nervous about it. I liked to act cool, but I had no taste for embarrassing people. If they became too nervous, they wouldn&rsquo;t know how to react, which would also be troubling to me. I preferred an idiot-like response from someone like Gobta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">TPO&mdash;time, place and occasion when reacting to things&mdash;I hoped they would understand this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The disciples were calmed by my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Confirming that, I nodded and entered the back room.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;As a side note&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something I didn&rsquo;t know at the time. Those disciples were not just nervous because I was their demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without my notice, Tempest Federation held a popularity contest. I was voted as one of the top three idols. They were me, Shuna and Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard that my popularity seemed to have been extraordinarily high. In addition, Ramiris and Milim were candidates as well. I don&rsquo;t dare to say the ranking, but I heard that Milim and I smashed the top of the charts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, should I sigh or feel joy about their growth? I was dumbfounded after being informed of what they were doing behind my back.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Which types of gear do you need?&rdquo; as we entered Kurobee&rsquo;s private quarters, he cut to the chase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since he asked what we wanted, we each began to list all the items we had in mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to ask Garm to craft some armor for us. It should be fun for you two to work together again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a point. I was going to check on Garm anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that said, we accompanied Kurobee on his way to Garm&rsquo;s workshop.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We stirred up a commotion once more, but I played dumb this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gear for monsters? Ahh, master&rsquo;s still got all the interesting ideas as always.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garm was rather shocked as we each &lsquo;Possessed&rsquo; our avatars in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. Then I shall do as you asked, actually, let me prepare something even better!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Just count on me. I&rsquo;m getting the creative itch as well. I&rsquo;m going to create </span><span class="c4 c8">the </span><span class="c1">ultra-strong gear that no human can hope to wield!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kurobee and Garm got on with their craft immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I&rsquo;m looking forward to it</span><span class="c1">&mdash;I thought to myself and left with the folks.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was gonna take days for the crafting to be completed. We spent this time getting used to the avatars, and thus we began our training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We did things like fighting monsters on the upper levels or attacking newcomers who seemed like actual adventurers. During these few days, we began to assign roles and were getting pretty good at it. But before we had reached that level of teamwork, we took plenty of beatings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were even losing to beginner teams on the upper floors. There were times when we were taken out by our own traps set in the labyrinth. Those were some awkward moments. That did really piss me off though, leading to the development of magic items that would prevent the labyrinth traps from getting triggered by us. However, the times we did fall to these traps would remain as fond memories.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Ramiris fell into a trap, getting Veldora tangled up in it as well. I floated into the air while Milim got pushed against the ceiling. Since I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about getting caught in traps, I had gotten careless and forgot to alert them. It was a huge misstep, but, speaking of which, Ramiris&hellip; </span><span class="c4 c8">How did you end up falling into a trap?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I could feel everyone relentlessly teasing her about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, as we endured, we trained all day and night without even catching a wink of sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In combat, the most important thing was coordination. Under normal circumstances, we would&rsquo;ve been able to call out to each other or give signals with a glance. However, we didn&rsquo;t have neat tricks like that. Mostly because Veldora and Milim were both tryhards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I did have a Skill that was basically like cheating. I could use &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; to contact everyone and deliver them precise commands. With myself as the command post, Veldora, Milim, and Ramiris were my foot soldiers. And in that way, we drastically increased our strength and raised our standards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once we could move with a certain level of confidence, we began to review our teamwork. Days passed as we waited for the equipment to be finished.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then that we were informed about &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; managing to break through level forty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is bad. Those people finally beat the tempest serpent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Their combat style is extremely meticulous. Their first group of combatants would collect intelligence, followed by the rest of the teams focusing on draining the enemy&rsquo;s stamina, and finally beating the Level Boss using their main force.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if a Level Boss were to be defeated, they would be revived at full health shortly thereafter. However, in the case that a Level Boss won, the scars and tiredness accrued would remain. If it were to continue to fight, the circumstances would clearly be in the favor of the challengers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was our miscalculation. We should&rsquo;ve provided more ways for the Level Bosses to heal themselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But all those monsters rely on instincts to survive,&rdquo; Veldora commented. His rationale was that those monsters weren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to use healing items.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was correct, but perhaps there was still a way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should we perhaps ask Treyni-san for help? Being the labyrinth managers, surely, they would be able to heal the monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, I see. I should go ask her for help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was how Treyni-san&rsquo;s sisters became part of the aid team to heal the monsters when they were wrapped up in continuous fights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, one by one, we managed to address all the issues.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those people are approaching level forty-nine fast, what do we do, Rimuru?&rdquo; Milim asked anxiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like she said, &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; was about to enter the final battle ground with us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our coordination should be sufficient despite our lack of equipment. Shall we attack them straight away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree! It&rsquo;s finally time for me to shine. I&rsquo;m gonna beat the devil out of those folks!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and Ramiris were pumped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, even if we were to fight seriously, our chances of winning weren&rsquo;t that high. I put my strongest traps on level forty-nine, so that was the only location where we could pull back team &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be helped, huh? We should at least wear some emergency gear&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, even if we were wearing top gear crafted by Kurobee and Garm, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to face our enemies head on. Although it would greatly increase the chances of our victory, so we might as well give it a try.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon thinking so, I was about to decide when&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Knock knock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of someone knocking on the door rang in the meeting room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, Kurobee wanted to tell you that &lsquo;He&rsquo;s ready&rsquo;,&rdquo; Shion notified me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing the news, we looked at each other with grins on our faces.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gear specially crafted for our monster avatars had been completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My gear were the Grim Reaper&#39;s scythe and robes of hell. A ghost could wear equipment as well, it was a specific property of magical gear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora&rsquo;s got the Grim Reaper&rsquo;s bastard sword and full body armor of hell. His left hand was equipped with the great shield of hell&rsquo;s gate. He was fully geared up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Milim who was playing a slime, she could only be equipped with simple things. She first swallowed the Grim Reaper&rsquo;s javelin and wore a crimson feathered cape. She immediately gained a pair of red wings after equipping it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That&rsquo;s some incredible change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The gear has to be equipped or it won&#39;t activate the effect!&rdquo; Milim said with glee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she was happy, I had no room to say anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris was next. She asked for heavy full body armor from Kurobee. The armor itself was finely crafted, the problem was whether or not she could wear it. Ramiris anxiously transferred herself to her avatar and tried to put on the armor. At that moment, lo and behold, the armor had been swapped out. With a loud &lsquo;Clang&rsquo;, the rubbish armor fell to the ground and turned into dust before being blown away by the wind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris&rsquo;s animated armor became heavy animated armor. This was not an evolution, and it also didn&rsquo;t seem to be a change in equipment. Instead, the pieces of armor themselves swapped their places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, I move so swiftly now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Ramiris said, before this her movement was very unnatural, like she needed to be lubricated. Now her movement looked very smooth. This would, surely, make coordination much smoother with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never expected the quality of the armor to have an effect on movement. What an unexpected discovery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing how happy Ramiris looked, I asked her to choose her weapons and shield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pooh! Stuff like shields are unnecessary for me!&rdquo; saying that, she chose a large two-handed weapon, the Grim Reaper&rsquo;s great axe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its sheer might makes it a top notch weapon, though wielding it may prove difficult. But never mind that, this would do. She always got mocked for being weak, so she probably got a little carried away this time. Interestingly, it reflected her personality as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, everyone changed to their new equipment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This equipment fell under unique-grade. Since they were adjusted to be equipped by monsters, their designs, however, were rather unbalanced and comical in nature. Still, for any amateur adventurers, this was incredibly strong gear. We also applied some sort of a curse to register their users, so that they couldn&rsquo;t be stolen. To us right now, these were the best gear out there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This new switch restored our resolve. Before we embarked on our battle, our spirits were soaring.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We checked the status of our avatars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My ghost had given up physical attacks and focused on magic and mental attacks. It served the role of a sorcerer. I hoped to learn about &lsquo;Spirit Magic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Illusion Magic&rsquo; soon, since my goal was to become a wizard. Aside from that, I also wanted to learn &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;. What would happen if I placed my faith in myself? That was kind of part of my experiment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora&rsquo;s skeleton swordsman was a Jack of all trades, he could do anything. He served the role of a heavy warrior, but seemed to want to learn magic and become a magic knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Milim&rsquo;s slime on the other hand specialized in speed and one-shot-kills. She&rsquo;s the super buffed type. Or perhaps I should call her the romantic type?</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was her job to be the assassin. She may have been able to learn a thing or two from Souei, but I had forbidden her from troubling others when she was just fooling around. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her approach was to launch an ambush by dropping from the ceiling for quick takedowns. If the enemies fell for it, she&rsquo;d look like a boss. But what would she do if the enemies saw through such a set up? Well, I think she would run away, considering her high mobility. In some ways, slime was the perfect form for this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris&rsquo;s heavy animated armor focused on strong attacks. It possessed some level of defense and even had the potential to be quite balanced. She fit the role of berserker. Not that she had really gone berserk, but it seemed that she has never considered her defensive capabilities. That was just how I had been calling her since she decided to become a dangerous monster bent on attacking. Once she had gotten familiarized with her abilities, I wanted her to team up with Veldora and play the role of shield for him.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything was prepared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We wouldn&rsquo;t get hungry, so our ability to fight on end would really shine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Let&rsquo;s fire up our spirits and try our best in stopping the &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a burning spirit, we stepped onto the battlefield. Yet it turned out&mdash;to our great disappointment, we crushed the &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; with ease&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Gotta stay calm, yep, I gotta stay calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">As I </span><span class="c4 c8">calmly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ran &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; on my avatar, I realized its power was almost at Rank A. This was mostly thanks to my gear, but it&rsquo;s pretty much the case when I was able to use my power smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we miscalculated one thing. The abilities of our original selves would be reflected in the avatars. Even though we couldn&rsquo;t use all of our Skills, with &lsquo;Thought Communication&rsquo; and &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; alone, these were enough to turn the favor to our side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For me personally, I could cast magic so fast it was almost cheating. Bound by my mana pool, I could not use all the magic, but my vast arcane knowledge remained. Compared to a third-rate court mage, my magic was still leagues ahead. I didn&rsquo;t need to chant my spells and could cast consecutively without delay. Surely our enemy couldn&rsquo;t handle that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Veldora, I almost suspected that he had a pair of eyes in the back of his head. He swung his sword like a master of swordsmanship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;GAHAHAHA! My &lsquo;Veldora Kill Streak Style</span><span class="c4 c40">TM</span><span class="c1">&rsquo; incorporates countless sword techniques. Hold on, that&rsquo;s not how it goes&mdash;&rdquo; and on he went with his nonsense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora seemed to have learned some techniques from the manga he read. And I thought that mangas were just making up the drawings, looks like there were actually practical techniques out there as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora was pretty unpredictable to begin with, so nothing could really surprise me at this point. Looking at him closely enough, you would realize he was acting like a moron.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, we had Milim. She wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said that she focused on speed. She zipped around at break-neck speeds. It was beyond what the average person could control, let alone replicate, yet with Milim&rsquo;s reflexes, it was a piece of cake. Actually, I should say that that&rsquo;s just how fast a slime could move when it got serious. She could ignore friction while sliding across the ground and closed in on the enemies with a bounce. The way she darted along the ceiling with the same speed, surely, made it close to impossible for your everyday adventurer to spot her clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was a slime as well, yet I&rsquo;d never realized such a thing until now. I was profoundly shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WAHAHAHA! You are so slow, all so slow. Eat this, you dimwit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim snuck behind her enemy without making a sound, acting all smug about it, and impaled the enemy&rsquo;s neck with her Grim Reaper&rsquo;s javelin&mdash;most fights with her ended like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Physical attacks couldn&rsquo;t easily harm her, and in order to cast magic against her, you would first need to get a clear fix on her. Now that I thought about this, it was pretty terrifying to fight Milim&rsquo;s slime as your opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person to complement Veldora and Milim was Ramiris, the &lsquo;Professional Wingman&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHOOOA! LET ME SHOW YOU HOW STRONG I AM!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She led the charge as soon as we saw enemies. In addition, Ramiris&rsquo;s combat style was to fight people head on. Under normal circumstances, this was a risky move that rarely acted in her favor. She&rsquo;s such an idiot. But for the rest of us, her doing so was the right tactic. After reminding her several times to no avail, we turned this in our favor. In short, we used Ramiris as bait while we launched a three-pronged attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, it would&rsquo;ve been tricky to pull this off. But Ramiris set loose on a blind rampage, utterly disregarding defense. All the enemies saw was a large set of armor wielding the Grim Reaper&rsquo;s great axe barreling towards them. By then, confronting it was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because she completely neglected defense, all of their attacks were focused on Ramiris. However, she had &lsquo;Pain Nullification&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s why she didn&rsquo;t even flinch and launched attacks one after another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, the armor itself was very sturdy. Sparing no cost and paying no mind to weight, the heavy animated armor was crafted out of thick sheets of magisteel. That imbued it with some level of &lsquo;Self Reconstruction&rsquo;, so a couple scratches were nothing to worry about. The sheer weight of the armor was enough to crush the average person, and imagining such a giant hunk of metal charging at you&mdash;the threat it posed to our enemies was readily apparent.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, and then there was my healing magic. As part of my experiment, I tried to cast &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo; and found that I easily managed to pull it off, much to my surprise. As opposed to believing in myself, I controlled the &lsquo;Spirit Particles&rsquo; that I originally could not manipulate through the use of prayers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, with me turned into a ghost, both the mana of my body and the words of my prayer would reach my original body. I then cast the magic borrowing the power of my original body. The purpose of prayer seemed to be to convey the will to execute the action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When manipulating &lsquo;Spirit Particles&rsquo;, you needed to listen to the individual wish of the prayer to execute them accordingly&mdash;with such a complex action, no matter how advanced my processing power was, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it. That&rsquo;s why I turned to a different method and had different individuals conduct the calculation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the number of people who prayed&mdash;my believers&mdash;increased, my mana rose in kind. In other words, I could improve my &ldquo;godliness&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, because I was connected to my believers, it also served as a secret technique. I could use the minds of my own believers to expand my processing power. This would also allow me to lend them mana and processing power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I see how it is now.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;That&rsquo;s why Ruminas wanted to expand the number of followers she had. With a large number of followers, she could instantly cast large-scale magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Ultimate Secret of Faith and Grace&rsquo;&mdash;I had learned a terrifying Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s drop that for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering this, I could now cast &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;. As a result, our team was extremely strong. And now, on level forty-nine filled with vicious intentions, we eliminated every member of the &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to face anything; we should embrace challenges. Had we attacked head on, we would have been defeated long ago. But rather, we honed our coordination and utilized traps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We ordered the slime dolls to damage our enemies&rsquo; weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We used slime rain to distract them and cause them to waste their stamina.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We took the chance to ambush them and backed them into the slime pool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ramiris roared to attract the enemies&rsquo; attention when Milim launched her sneak attack to completely disrupt the enemy&#39;s formation. Veldora focused on cutting them off and isolating the rearguard. We used the giant slime to defeat the weaker mages and thieves and had Veldora and Ramiris force the rest of their main combat force into the slime pool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The goal was to destroy their gear with strong acid. Damaging the main force of &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; was to slow down their progress. That was our goal in this fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Annoying! All our hard work&mdash;ruined!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pathetic cry made me realize that the captain of &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; was a woman. That surprised me a bit, but what she said next caught my attention even more so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s retreat while we&rsquo;ve still made some gains. This is probably a good point to stop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, &lsquo;home nation&rsquo; has given the order anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She talked to a surviving male member of the team that seemed to be her subordinate. She did just say that &ldquo;the home nation has given the order.&rdquo; I heard that the mercenary group &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t belong to any nation; they were free-lancers. I heard that their benefactor was the Ingracia Kingdom, could it be that their entire group was hired? The way she said &ldquo;home nation gave the order&rdquo; sounded as though their loyalty towards it was more than a mere customer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Looks like I need to be mindful of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the dungeon would attract customers, it was gonna attract many people with unchecked backgrounds. Regarding that, I&rsquo;d been mentally prepared for it from the start, but it seemed that I needed to remind everyone about that once again. The &lsquo;Green Rebellion&rsquo; incident made me realize this once more. Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is wonderful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, we won!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That goes without saying, we are the invincible team!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">These idiots need to be reminded or they&#39;ll soon get carried away with their immediate victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being said, right now even I was basking in the joy of completing our mission.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="You"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.jcf929d20hga"><span class="c22 c4">Intermission</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c26 c4">Mariabell</span></p><hr><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mariabell was a &lsquo;Reincarnated One&rsquo;.

People murdered their own kind, creating a hell on Earth that was bathed in blood. Houses were burnt down, families were lost, and people grieved and moaned. She built her affluence on top of all these misfortunes and not once had she doubted her actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell lived a happy life until she passed by old age&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was able to enjoy the same lifestyle now. She was born as a princess of the small kingdom of Siltorozzo. She was a member of the clan that ruled the Western Nations as their overlords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this world plagued by monsters, kingdoms wouldn&rsquo;t easily wage war against each other. Under such circumstances, it prompted the birth of the Western State Council. One man formed the council hundreds of years prior, the Grand Elder of the Rosso family&mdash;Granbell Rosso.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one knew how old this mysterious person was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the Five Great Elders controlled the Council, Granbell was the head of the Elders. And as the Rosso family cemented its strength in the Western Nations, he was also the clan leader.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s who Granbell Rosso was, even a princess under his direct lineage would not be able to meet him. In fact, even Mariabell&rsquo;s brothers were unable to meet with the Five Great Elders. No one really had the fortune to do so. But that was normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Mariabell was different. Her knowledge and will were something that even Granbell could not ignore.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Currency is required for the development of a civilization.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the past, crops such as wheat were used for bartering, but as humanity entered the era of monetary economy, civilization made a giant leap forward. The main reason was due to growth in the scale of economies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, the value of currency also changed. Currencies were once made of valuable metals such as gold and silver to ensure its value. However, in the new age, physical currencies were replaced by certificates and documents during trade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the birth of the paper money economy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, a mechanism required for the money to flow was born&mdash;the banking system. You would receive receipts by storing your gold coins in a bank, and in return, you could exchange those receipts for the physical, material currency. The banks could utilize the money stored in them at will; thus, they came up with a different mode of business: loaning money to those in need and turning a profit by setting interest rates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a sorcery worse than alchemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Primarily, there was no money there, and yet, interest was accruing. On one hand was the total amount of physical money circulating in the market, and on the other was the total amount of receipts.. When comparing the two, there would always be a certain unrecoverable difference&hellip; Someone would eventually have to pay the price for being unable to cover this fabricated margin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fundamental issue was inherent to the system of lending money and receiving interest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a phenomenon became even worse when physical currencies were replaced by paper money. People would ask for loans from rich people with the interest rate as bait. Afterward, they would use the money to invest in financial products&mdash;to use money to make money. This cycle would continue beyond national boundaries and into the entire world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guaranteed in the name of the state, cash would be printed without limits. Meanwhile, the relative differences in national power would be exploited to manipulate the exchange rate and expand the scale of the economy to a dozen times its previous size. Including even the amount of paper money issued, the market was dominated by Mariabell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The illusion of a large-scale economy was far from the real economy. It was much, much smaller in reality. And one day, this bubble would burst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as her former self, who inflated the bubble as much as possible before bursting it, she would then push unpayable debts to the weaker countries and have them take on the responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;In other words, it was a war of balancing the accounts. In this way, weaker nations would crumble, while the rich would get richer. Instead of a single person paying the price, a whole nation would. There was basically not that much difference.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell was well-versed in such methods. She was known as a financial genius in her past life. She had the memories of her past life and an intense desire to dominate. These all fueled Mariabell&rsquo;s power: her Unique Skill &lsquo;Greedy One (Greed)&rsquo;. The Unique Skill &lsquo;Greedy One&rsquo; originated from the seven original sins of man. It belonged to the Skill type known as the &lsquo;Deadly Sins&rsquo;. These were a special presence even among Unique Skills, as they represented the desire of their users. The users&rsquo; emotions and wishes manifested in the form of their Skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell was born to be the strongest among the Rosso. The power to dominate human desire&mdash;that was the ability of the &lsquo;Greedy One&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could see through people&rsquo;s desires. The greater their desires were, the easier they could be manipulated. Everyone had his desire, and once she stimulated it, he would dance to Mariabell&rsquo;s score. Starting from people around her, she gradually increased the number of pawns she owned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There was no need to panic. For she had already realized that the civilization of this world was not advanced enough. Even though there </span><span class="c4 c8">was </span><span class="c1">an economy, within their economic circle, only one form of currency was used. It was a world without language barriers, quite unlike the world she came from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But seeing it from a different light, she could exploit her environment. It was to the point that she thought this was her own personal playground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Yes, yes indeed. I will dominate this world as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To dominate this world&mdash;to Mariabell, such was a natural thought. When she grew up and her words mattered, the world would become Mariabell&rsquo;s plaything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But until then, there should be as few people as possible who were to know her ambition. Upon thinking so, Mariabell decided to act with utmost caution in order to avoid revealing her true self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when she was three years old, Mariabell met Granbell.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you are Mariabell?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, pleased to meet you, Grandfather.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That didn&rsquo;t sound like the greeting a three-year-old would give. It was just a part of Mariabell&rsquo;s calculation. Granbell was unlike the riffraff in the castle. To Mariabell, even her father, who was a king, was nothing but a pawn. As well as her brothers, her babysitter, her servants and countless more. Mariabell saw right through their desires and had since been manipulating them from the dark as her pawns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Granbell was different. He was special.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing that Mariabell was no longer putting on an act, Granbell asked: &ldquo;So, you are not planning to manipulate me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was not a single scrap of familial love in his words, only the tone between the ruler and the servant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell realized that her instincts were right. Had she tried to deceive Granbell, she could have been killed that instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Greedy One&rsquo; was not all-powerful and could be resisted. There was a chance that she might actually have dominated Granbell by applying the Skill more frequently over time, but Granbell would not have allowed her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based on these judgements, Mariabell decided to come clean. She needed help anyway, and now that she thought about it, Granbell could be her most ideal aid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can see what people desire, I can see them all. By stimulating their desire, I can manipulate people at will. But grandfather is different. Your ambition is greater than anyone else&rsquo;s, yet your will is also strong enough to suppress it perfectly, that&rsquo;s why&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, you managed to see through all of that, little girl&mdash;no, Mariabell. Who are you exactly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me? I am Mariabell. Mariabell of &lsquo;Greed&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh heh, HAHAHA! How interesting, you are bold enough to announce yourself like that in front of my face!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Grand Elder of the Rosso family took a liking to Mariabell.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two then laid their cards on the table and shared each other&rsquo;s secrets. Granbell revealed the situation with the Western Nations as well as the demon lords that dominated the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell, on the other hand, shared knowledge from her past life as well as what her acquired Unique Skill &lsquo;Greedy One&rsquo; was capable of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To Mariabell, this was the gamble of her lifetime. Putting aside her intelligence, she was just a three-year-old kid. She knew that it would be difficult for her to survive on her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">No matter how, no matter what it takes, I will take my place here. To do that&mdash;</span><span class="c1">She needed to make sure the ruler, Granbell Rosso, thought highly of Mariabell. Her instincts told her that this was the best way for her to one day become a ruler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this gamble, Mariabell hit the jackpot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mariabell, if anything happens to me, you shall carry on my ambition. I wish the world to be a peaceful place. Under the rule of us Rosso, we can build a world where everyone is equal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I understand. I understand, grandfather. I swear to give my all to aid your ambition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the two built a bond that none could harm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Grandfather and granddaughter&mdash;an alliance between an ex-&lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Greed&rsquo; itself, began on that day. From then on, Granbell would spend years guiding Mariabell. She would learn the whole truth about the depths of the Rosso&rsquo;s power, as well as receiving many aides by her side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She even learnt the true identity of the god Ruminas and Granbell&rsquo;s secrets. In order to protect his true identity&mdash;one of the &lsquo;Seven Celestial Sages&rsquo;, he frequently acted behind the scenes. She also learnt the truth that the true power guarding the Western Nations was Demon Lord Ruminas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Granbell told Mariabell everything.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, Mariabell, at the age of, was second only to Granbell. She was ready to begin her operation to take down Rimuru with everything she had.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Up"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Chapter 3</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image18.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Never"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.b26m5ylh4wxm"><span class="c22 c4">Chapter 4</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c26">The True Identity of the Mastermind</span></p><hr><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c26 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The beautiful ex-mercenary&mdash;Glenda Adley. Every time she pulled her trigger, a life was taken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ever since she was summoned to this world, she held onto her beloved firearm. It had never betrayed Glenda&rsquo;s expectations. It became a part of her, so much so that shooting became second nature. With the addition of the Unique Skill &lsquo;Sniper&rsquo;, Glenda was invincible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unique Skill &lsquo;Sniper&rsquo;&mdash;this Skill has three main functions: &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; for the amazing ability to identify any target, &lsquo;Outcome Calculation&rsquo; to analyze actions, and &lsquo;Space Manipulation&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last function in particular, &lsquo;Space Manipulation,&rsquo; made Glenda almost invincible. Within her field of vision, Glenda could connect the space between any two points. In other words, her effective range of fire was anywhere within her eyesight. She could fire a bullet right next to the enemy&#39;s head, making bullets pass through any obstacles at will to hit the intended target. Factors such as gravity and air resistance could be neglected by her, allowing her to perform long-distance sniping even without a sniper rifle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These conditions made her emerge victorious in every fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the misstep she made last time made her realize that there were stronger individuals out there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">It wouldn&rsquo;t work. Monsters like that are too strong for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a single glance, Glenda had immediately recognized how dangerous her enemy was. That opponent&mdash;Diablo&mdash;was someone Glenda couldn&rsquo;t hurt with her pistol. This wasn&rsquo;t simply about physical attacks being ineffective against Diablo, however.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were two different types of bullets in her arsenal that Glenda could fire: normal bullets and magic bullets. If she didn&rsquo;t want to leave any magical trace, she would use the normal bullets. Faced by monsters that were resistant to physical attacks, she would concentrate her own mana into bullets and fire them as a magical attack. It was a universal mechanism that was designed to be effective against all manner of opponents Therefore, one would assume that Glenda had no blind spots in that regard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, her fight against Diablo was different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda&rsquo;s instincts were screaming at her to run away. Her &lsquo;Outcome Calculation&rsquo; she had relied on predicted no other outcome but her demise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with her overpowered abilities, there were still opponents in this world that she couldn&rsquo;t defeat. On that day, this fact was laid bare in front of her eyes. It was hard for her to swallow.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And today&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda started to work on the assassination as her target came within range of her &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bullet she shot would appear around fifty centimeters away from the target. In a blink of an eye, her target would receive a headshot&mdash;that was common sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fifty centimeters was a wonderful distance. When connecting dimensions, there could only be a certain amount of mass overlapping with the wormhole, anything exceeding a certain threshold would cause the connection to fail. In other words, if her target moved around, the space that Glenda connected between them could be disrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why she chose fifty centimeters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how strong her opponent was, no one could deal with such a small object suddenly appearing at such a short distance. The bullet would tear through the air at supersonic speed; her target probably wouldn&rsquo;t even catch a glimpse of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">It may be a different case for a monster like Diablo, but some prince of a large state is much easier to deal with. Never mind, there&rsquo;s no use for me to sigh at this point. Let&rsquo;s just prepare for the next encounter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Glenda was calm and composed, but in the next second, something shocking occurred. The bullet that was meant to pierce through the prince&rsquo;s skull disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How can this be! What happened!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The unexpected situation of paranormal activity became her reality. She didn&rsquo;t understand the reason, but if someone were to have done this, it must&rsquo;ve been the demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it that guy? I&rsquo;ve underestimated the master of that asshole demon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda&rsquo;s instincts told her so. She fired once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the perfect ambush didn&rsquo;t work, taking more shots would be in vain. Even though she knew this in her heart, the mission would fail if she did not do so. Her master Mariabell and Elder Granbell would not tolerate such a misstep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This, ultimately, made her miss her chance to flee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, indeed. You have underestimated Rimuru-sama. That is unforgivable, and I don&rsquo;t intend to forgive you either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, who is there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Souei, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s loyal &lsquo;Secret Spy&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda was shocked, but she realized something. He didn&rsquo;t ask for her name. Glenda judged that it was not because he wasn&rsquo;t interested, but that he had planned to capture her before interrogating her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that was the case, all that was left for her was to flee in order to hide the information she held.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The assassination had failed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, the worst outcome would be her capture. If she were to continue making mistakes, she would be executed for incompetence. There had been several colleagues of hers who suffered that fate. She had to prioritize running away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After making up her mind, she engaged a stand-off against her enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;He knew about my planned attack?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I spoke too much, but Rimuru-sama has already seen through everything. You can resist all you want, I don&rsquo;t plan to kill you anyway. But the more you resist, the more you will suffer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! How generous of you. Then I shall not hold back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without hesitation, Glenda pulled her trigger as she finished her sentence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She only shot one normal bullet. There were sixteen more rounds left. However, she figured that it wouldn&rsquo;t work on this majin called Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Magic bullets might work&hellip;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As she thought so, Glenda pulled out her army knife. It was clean and swift. There was elegance in her ferocious strike as Glenda slashed at Souei. He dodged the attack with minimal movement, Glenda grinned as she saw that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The knife was enchanted with her mana. Not only did her weapon deal physical damage, she also gave the knife a magic effect. This was specifically used to deal with opponents who were resistant to physical attacks. Souei surely wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that the knife was of any threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, Glenda had seen through Souei&rsquo;s preference in combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">This guy doesn&rsquo;t like dragging on with combat. If that&rsquo;s the case, he probably would get tricked by a simple attack like this. I&rsquo;ll break your calm demeanor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she thought, Glenda continued her attack. Her right hand had her knife while her left hand held her gun. She didn&rsquo;t hesitate to continue shooting as she observed Souei&rsquo;s reaction. As she predicted, he didn&rsquo;t react much, since Souei thought that even if the attack were to connect, it wouldn&rsquo;t deal much damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he wasn&rsquo;t getting careless, he was still very cautious of Glenda&rsquo;s right hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I&rsquo;ve still got one more card up my sleeve. But among the people I&rsquo;ve battled, he&rsquo;s probably the strongest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As far as she was concerned, Diablo didn&rsquo;t count. Her logic was that opponents she couldn&rsquo;t fight at all should not be included.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then that Souei&rsquo;s left index finger twitched. Glenda didn&rsquo;t miss it, she immediately backflipped away upon sensing the danger. She quickly distanced herself from her opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the right call. In the next second, extremely thin strings closed in on where Glenda was just a moment ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ho, you are quite sharp.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks for the compliment, you ain&rsquo;t half bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While exchanging praise, Glenda didn&rsquo;t forget to shoot in return of the favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not too big of a threat to Souei. As opposed to dodging, he was more focused on approaching her head on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">As expected, he&rsquo;s pretty naive. That&rsquo;s great, this type of enemy is easy to take care of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magic bullets didn&rsquo;t require gunpowder. They could be shot while suppressed, and you could mix them in while shooting normal bullets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her opponent, who had gotten used to her tactic, would be too careless to defend himself. She would be able to defeat him when he least expected it. That was Glenda&rsquo;s strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The attack that he thought was incapable of harming him would become the fatal blow. Even if her opponent was on guard, such a sudden strike would still be difficult to react to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda had defeated some strong people before, and Souei&rsquo;s reaction was just like theirs. As his right shoulder was hit by the magic bullet, he was sent flying spectacularly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahahahaha, how embarrassing for a handsome man like you. Lamar fell for the same trick. The more confident you are, the easier it is to be played by a simple trick such as this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda laughed out loud. But her eyes weren&rsquo;t slacking. She was inspecting Souei&rsquo;s wound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You shouldn&rsquo;t be careless when hunting your prey. That was the ironclad rule of warfare. Until she made sure that her opponent was dead, Glenda would not let her guard down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, she didn&rsquo;t think that one bullet would be able to kill Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I see you are more difficult to handle than I expected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You a sore loser or something? Sorry, but since you&rsquo;ve seen my face, I&rsquo;ll have to eliminate you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei stood up, his right arm missing. Glenda could see her victory before her. Still, she was even more cautious as she pointed the gun in front of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Magic bullet worked. And now for my trump card, I&rsquo;m gonna make sure to blow his head off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda activated her Unique Skill &lsquo;Sniper&rsquo; and aimed cautiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, rest assured, the order I received was to capture you. I suppose the goal was to interrogate you for information, but Rimuru-sama is a kind man. If you were to tell us everything we wanted to know, he wouldn&rsquo;t take your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got balls talking all big at this point!&rdquo; Glenda roared as she pulled the trigger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three bullets aimed for his head and two for his heart. Five magic bullets in total were fired as planned. The bullets were shot and instantly warped in space, appearing in front of Souei, as well as the right of his head. There were also bullets shot directly in front of his heart and to his left flank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All five bullets tore into his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Warp Bullet&mdash;Glenda&rsquo;s ultimate technique. The magic bullets spawned from mana were different from normal bullets and would disrupt magicule. Even if her opponent could regenerate, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to revive after being hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter if her opponent were a master of knife and gun play, when getting hit by supersonic bullets coming from all directions, even the best amongst the elite would not be able to handle it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda had come to understand her capabilities from her past experiences. That was the secret to her survival. For this reason, Glenda was certain that Souei had met his end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s body crumbled into black smoke in front of Glenda&rsquo;s eyes. She was relieved. Since she had laid eyes on Souei, she had felt a deep feeling of unease. Even though it was not as sharp as when she ran into Diablo, her instinct told her that her opponent was dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are done. Since you were strong, I didn&rsquo;t want to hold back,&rdquo; Glenda muttered after feeling greatly reassured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet it seemed that she had done so too early.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A voice that, by all common sense, should not have been heard was raised behind her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? Then you shall promptly admit defeat and let me capture you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda jumped away subconsciously. She turned back quickly and found Souei standing there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-how is this possible! Didn&rsquo;t you just die&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re just full of jokes, aren&rsquo;t you? How could that weak of an attack have killed me? In the first place, there&rsquo;s no reason for me to lose to a cheap shot like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do it again&mdash;eh, what?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda&rsquo;s line was cut short.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was to be expected. To her disbelief, Souei&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4">aura</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;began to spread all around her. She quickly initiated &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; and saw a reality that she didn&rsquo;t want to face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no way! How can this be, why are you everywhere? What kind of joke is this! What kind of Skill is this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple. I have a Skill called &lsquo;Clone&rsquo;. And that was it. They are not as strong as me, but since you were able to defeat one of my &lsquo;Clones&rsquo;, you should be proud of yourself,&rdquo; Souei praised Glenda. Yet there were still four other Soueis standing. Glenda had nowhere to run.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it all&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After shouting in a tone devoid of womanly charm, she launched her attack at Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle that would teach her despair, began.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On a balcony overlooking the blooming flowers in the courtyard, a young girl, a young man, and an old man stood around a round table, looking intently at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These three were Mariabell, Yuuki and Johann.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It failed, it really failed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This line came out of Mariabell&rsquo;s lips in a sad tone. All the while, her face was casual as always. It was expected of her, as it was a part of her plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gavan sure is unlucky. What a waste of your efforts he&rsquo;s been.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann, who sat in front of Mariabell, sighed with wine in his hand. Although he didn&rsquo;t really mean it, he did feel some sympathy towards Gavan. After all, just like Johann, Gavan was a member of the Five Great Elders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Correction, former member of the Five Great Elders. The miscalculation this time had led to Gavan&rsquo;s complete loss of authority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gavan was so useless. It&rsquo;s probably because he has stayed in Ingracia for too long, that he has become somewhat attached to the king. Or else he would have had full control over the royal family long ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t ask for the impossible. Even us Rossos were not able to influence the central power of Ingracia, let alone Gavan&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not correct. It&rsquo;s a piece of cake to control the core of their power. All we need to do is to kill everyone else and leave one heir and one only. It would be perfect if the child had Gavan&rsquo;s blood in him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip;suppose you have a point&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell knew the history of bloodshed in that dark era of time, so she thought such a method was fairly mild. In fact, in terms of the amount of blood that would be spilled, this was relatively peaceful, she thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to Johann, he wanted to comment that &ldquo;A large nation&rsquo;s security won&rsquo;t be that slacking.&rdquo; Even if she could come up with such an idea, to execute it would not be as simple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, I am interested in the magic inquisitors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Are you referring to the heathens under the command of the king of Ingracia?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep, how annoying, how very annoying. They must have been desperate to build up their military just to stand against us Rossos.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They seemed pretty strong. Gavan has experienced them firsthand and informed me about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To subjects dominated by her &lsquo;Greedy One&rsquo;, Mariabell could share intelligence with them to some extent. Any information obtained by an individual would inform Mariabell. That&rsquo;s why she used Gavan as a disposable pawn. She did so to draw out the magic inquisitors to handle the situation, so she could investigate their secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The incident that led to all of this was the stupid action Gavan had directed at Demon Lord Rimuru. Since Gavan was a count of the Ingracia Kingdom, surely, it would have lured out the magic inquisitors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell had foreseen that. And just as she predicted, she uncovered the secret of the magic inquisitors. The revelation made it apparent. They were merely humans who became majins after absorbing the power of monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was quite unlike Majin Larzen of the old Farmus Kingdom, who had entered a higher state of being through his own training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Due to the repulsive reaction with the monster elements, magic inquisitors even had their self-consciousness erased. To Mariabell, they were simply uninteresting toys. However, before they transformed into majins, they still seemed to possess consciousness. Depending on the amount of elements absorbed, they could fight in almost any circumstances. Their strength would be close to flawless as they broke through Rank A.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">That does seem kind of useful</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Mariabell thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How terrifying. In order to gain such information, you knew from the start that Gavan&rsquo;s plan would have failed, yet you still permitted it anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all. My goal was to raise your credibility. Demon Lord Rimuru would now think that you are worthy of trust.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, even if he didn&rsquo;t ask, he understood. Mariabell&rsquo;s goal from the start was to eliminate Demon Lord Rimuru; the magic inquisitors were just a bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted Johann to investigate Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">If I were to fail as well, am I going to end up with the same fate as Gavan and be eliminated by her&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wasn&rsquo;t as incompetent as Gavan, yet in addition to this thought, Johann had now gained an unspeakable horror towards Mariabell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Y-you gotta be kidding me. I became one of the Five Great Elders and stood at the top of the seven seas, how can some child like this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was just in his mind, these were words he couldn&rsquo;t speak out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann returned to the previous topic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then how about we let the magic inquisitors handle Demon Lord Rimuru? We could frame Demon Lord Rimuru with some crime and&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, that would only anger the demon lord. The magic inquisitors may be tough, but they&rsquo;re only so strong. It&rsquo;s impossible for them to stand against the demon lord. Such a plan won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sad to hear&hellip; So, our best option is to cooperate with the demon lord, after all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell shook her head upon hearing so, dismissing that option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No use, that&rsquo;s no use. Basically, except for grandfather, everyone has had a huge misunderstanding towards the situation, including you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Misunderstanding?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Humans and demon lords are equal&mdash;that&rsquo;s your misunderstanding. Do you know why I proposed to grandfather to eliminate the demon lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was it because the demon lord would create a new economic circle and will threaten us economically?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. But that was simply on the surface level. The real reason is that we can do nothing about the demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann was deeply afraid of the young girl, Mariabell. And just now, Mariabell responded with a face of displeasure. Feeling uneasy, Johann hurried her to continue her explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s military might is truly frightening. What do you think will happen if this demon lord uses military force to negotiate with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-that would be&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing her explanation, Johann finally realized the severity of the matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this world, due to the common threat of monsters, kingdoms seldom battled amongst themselves. Even if there were to be a dispute, the council would intervene to mitigate. The nation with greater economic capabilities normally spoke with greater impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, even for large nations such as the old Farmus, or Ingracia, their military alone would not be able to stand against the combined force of all the council&rsquo;s member states.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moreover, the strength of this nation is not their military alone. To be bound by rules is the equivalent of losing freedom. However, if they were to make the rules themselves, surely, that would mean their nation would not be at any loss, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if Tempest decided to follow the rules set up by the council, the future remained unknown. If everyone learned the economic value of the Tempest Federation, the Western Nations would be their puppets to toy with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demon lord could achieve domination through peaceful means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or through military force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or with economic pressure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strong nations would have the authority to dictate&mdash;that was an unchanging truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pathetic, how very pathetic. The council can lay some impressive rhetoric on the negotiation table, but all of that depends on the generosity of the demon lord. Time will pass and a new era will begin, our fate will rest on the demon lord&rsquo;s whims, when the time comes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann understood, he knew this was how things may develop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, the demon lord said that he wished to coexist with humans&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he was halfway through his sentence, Johann found Mariabell&rsquo;s cold eyes glaring at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fools, how foolish, not just you, the same goes for all of the council. What a bunch of idiots.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unimpressed, Mariabell began to explain further so that Johann could understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if there hadn&rsquo;t been a problem now, what did the future hold? If humans who had forgotten the threat the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo; posed, pissed off Demon Lord Rimuru&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long a demon lord can live, however, I know that human lives </span><span class="c4 c8">are</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;limited. If we cannot stop the demon lord&rsquo;s ambition now, the dream of us Rossos would practically be destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That demon lord could always change his mind. It may be a different case for humans, but to expect those with longevity to share the same value as humans&mdash;how could something that stupid happen, Mariabell explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, the idea of cooperating with the demon lord, or even exploiting the demon lord, are both huge misjudgments. They are impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann was at a loss of words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost as if to pour salt on Johann&rsquo;s wounds, the &lsquo;Blood Shadow&rsquo; under his command reported back to him through &lsquo;Magic Communication&rsquo;. The message was that Glenda had been defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How is that possible! Glenda was captured?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann was shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Is this true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Mariabell was unable to hide her surprise. Glenda was praised for her discretion. Mariabell was confident that she could survive during any crises. She didn&rsquo;t put her trust in Glenda&rsquo;s personality or anything, but rather on her desire to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How unbelievable, that cunning fox was&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda was one of the successful cases of the Rosso&#39;s secret summonings. Through sorcery, they forced &lsquo;Otherworlders&rsquo; to pledge their loyalty to them. They were renowned for their strength and were treated like tactical weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And someone as capable as Glenda was not only defeated, but captured. Johann couldn&rsquo;t believe that was the case. He was a mere mortal despite his position among the Five Great Elders. Unlike Granbell and Mariabell, he could only process human logic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring Johann, Mariabell began to strategize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">There&rsquo;s no way we can defeat him, but perhaps I can dominate him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would have to do. Mariabell made up her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m setting up a trap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A trap? What do you plan to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann had been passive for the most part until now. This was the first time he asked Mariabell a proper question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, a trap,&rdquo; Mariabell said as she turned to Yuuki. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you and your subordinate going to explore some ancient sites with Demon Lord Rimuru? I will set it there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not merely a confirmation, it was her order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Kagali is going, but it may be dangerous!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Demon Lord Milim is coming as well, that&rsquo;s why setting up a trap there would be dangerous,&rdquo; Yuuki advised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He believed that they should try to win Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s trust this time. The plan needed to aim for the long term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Mariabell had made her decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no. Given more time, that demon lord would only become more difficult to deal with. That&rsquo;s what my instinct tells me. Yuuki, can you prevent Demon Lord Milim from coming?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no way. They seemed to be suspecting me. At this point if I were to reject her, it would be the equivalent of me confessing that I&rsquo;m the villain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a point, then we shall take care of Demon Lord Milim as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is madness! This is not merely reckless, you don&rsquo;t even have any card to play here, Mariabell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki listened to Mariabell&#39;s words in disbelief, while Johann stood up to oppose them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was only natural. To defeat a single demon lord alone was already something to be cautious about. Yet now she wanted to deal with two demon lords at the same time. This was essentially driving the chance of success down to zero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet Mariabell was still smiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to give it all we have and go all-out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do! Even if I were to give it your all, my subordinates, the Moderate Clown Troupe, they are currently unavailable. Moreover&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how strong they are, but they can&rsquo;t help if they aren&rsquo;t around&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s retort was cut short by Mariabell. To her, the Moderate Clown Troupe was nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was because Mariabell had laid eyes on a power much stronger&mdash;something that was strong enough to combat the demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;However, Yuuki, I did ask you to get me &lsquo;a certain something&rsquo; from the &lsquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Nest&rsquo;. That can be useful now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Certain something&rsquo;&mdash;could you be referring to that?! You want to use that thing? No way! That&rsquo;s something even I can&rsquo;t control!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. That thing belonged to Demon Lord Milim anyway, we are just giving it back to her. That&rsquo;s how the plot will go, Demon Lord Clayman kept that thing as his trump card and it was utilized by the remaining force of his faction. That way, Demon Lord Milim won&rsquo;t get mad at us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This may end up inflicting great harm on humans as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-nothing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Johann brought this up in the hope of changing Mariabell&rsquo;s mind. Yet she disregarded it with the wave of a hand. She may have given it some thought if he had some other plan to suggest, but that alone was not enough to pique Mariabell&rsquo;s interest. Moreover, Johann couldn&rsquo;t think of an alternative plan anyway. Mariabell&rsquo;s plan was therefore finalized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Johann was continuing his meaningless struggle, Yuuki tried to understand Mariabell&rsquo;s thought process. In the end, he realized that this plan had a higher chance of success than he had first imagined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;It makes sense. With that, we can draw Demon Lord Milim away to fight her own battle. Rimuru-san wouldn&rsquo;t be able to intervene, it would be great to isolate the demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, smart boy, how very smart. And while Demon Lord Milim is distracted by that toy&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will focus on controlling Rimuru-san, is that correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&#39;s the idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, I have one concern.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean the &lsquo;Storm Dragon&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Impressive, indeed. If we fail to dominate Rimuru-san and cause Veldora to lose control, what should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If their target resisted more intensely than imagined, and they had no chance of controlling him, Yuuki would have to kill Rimuru. Yuuki was afraid that things would lead down that path, and tried to hint at the possibility. Yet Mariabell seemed to have expected this as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about that, Yuuki. There&rsquo;s no need for you to worry about anything. Just focus on how to defeat Demon Lord Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki was unable to disobey Mariabell. He could only follow her order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I understand. If you say so, I shall trust you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell nodded after hearing Yuuki&rsquo;s answer.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell had a thorough understanding of the affairs in this world. It came from everything Great Elder Granbell had taught her about demon lords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Demon Lord Rimuru were to be eliminated, Storm Dragon Veldora would start ravaging the land. Surely, Demon Lord Ruminas would figure out a way to deal with the Storm Dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, paradoxically, that would be better than allowing Demon Lord Rimuru to exploit the current affairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Demon Lord Rimuru and Demon Lord Ruminas formed an alliance. This meant that Demon Lord Ruminas had handed the running of the Western Nations over to Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Queen of Nightmare that saw humans as mere food had until now, handed that mission to the &lsquo;Seven Celestial Sages&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, it did not last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the fall of Granbell, the &lsquo;Seven Celestials&rsquo; had fallen as well. Granbell lost the protection of Demon Lord Ruminas and could no longer reign over the Western Nations with her strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surely, in the future, the power of Hinata the Saint would only increase. By manipulating Hinata, Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s system of domination would be set in stone&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I cannot allow that to happen. And for that cause, I&rsquo;d subject the whole world to the threat of Veldora</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Mariabell made her resolve in her heart.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After this, Mariabell and Yuuki paired up to initialize a detailed attack plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Johann had no room to intervene. He could only pray for the success of their plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Thus, the </span><span class="c4">majins</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cautiously planned out their malicious assault to eliminate Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the lengthy meeting, we met up at the cafe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Changing out of the suit, I was back in my casual clothes. Since our business here was done, I could just use &lsquo;Dimensional Transportation&rsquo; to go back home. But Souei had not brought back the culprit yet. Afraid that something may have gone wrong, I decided to stay a little longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, the meeting was super tiring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The prince of Ingracia, Elric, forced his way in mid-meeting. There was also that middle aged man, Gavan, pulling the strings. Moreover, there were all those councilors who were on their side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things ended up in failure, causing all of them to be stunned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gavan seemed to be a noble of high standing, yet he was taken away by some dangerous guys called magic inquisitors. The other councilors enjoyed diplomatic immunity, but with the document I provided, their home nations would probably judge them. Disgrace was all that awaited them, no doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They seemed frightened by the gravity of the situation, but they got what they deserved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though I wasn&#39;t part of the ruckus, some people were still looking down on me with their noble mindset. If these people were innocent, I wouldn&rsquo;t hold them accountable. However, after taking one look at the ledger, I realized they were all corrupt to the core. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to use this opportunity to punish them and sent the ledger to their home nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that it had been done, even those rude idiots would get taken care of. Some people used their position as councilors to enrich their personal lives. For the good of the future, it was best to make them disappear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sipped on my coffee as I reflected on the meeting.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, a lot of things have happened. Thankfully, Hinata and Shuna got pissed off first. I&rsquo;m the demon lord after all, it&rsquo;s not exactly appropriate for me to go and deal with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get pissed off, I just thought that they were rather rude with their diplomatic approach and wanted to teach them a bit about manners.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too, Rimuru-sama. I was merely punishing those rude individuals. If I had really gotten mad, I would have made them disappear from this world, not a speck of dust left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata and Shuna both gave off a smile. They were so synchronized that it was scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To such a ferocious response, I could only nod and reply &ldquo;A-ah, I see.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.jpg" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Yandere Duo"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be honest, this has been a great experience,&rdquo; Benimaru interjected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, but I was so angry that my head went blank and didn&rsquo;t know how to let out the anger. Had Shuna not done anything sooner, I would have burnt every human in that room to ash.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; Hearing this, I almost spat out all my coffee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought that Benimaru was just quietly observing on the side. I was even impressed, thinking that he had become more mature. But in reality, he was just so angry that he forgot about himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">What a waste of my praise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or perhaps it was a close call. Had I let him go on a rampage, we would have become the nemesis of humanity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi oi oi, you, do not do something like that, absolutely not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, I was just joking!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru tried to get past the conversation with his bright laughter, but he couldn&rsquo;t fool me. This guy was serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Before the next council meeting, we must nominate a </span><span class="c4">councilor</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for our nation. I needed to be cautious about the candidate.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we chatted, I finished my coffee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I have captured the culprit,&rdquo; Souei reported to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew he would do just fine, it looked like he got the job done. As always, he was so competent and did his job perfectly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The culprit was a very strong enemy. She didn&rsquo;t announce her name after I demanded to know, so her identity is still unclear. However, she did call Rimuru-sama &lsquo;the master of the asshole demon&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, that was okay. There was no way a professional assassin on a mission would reveal her identity like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though, was the asshole demon she referred to&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was she talking about Diablo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Uh&mdash;so that&rsquo;s how it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo didn&rsquo;t report this back to me&mdash;but since even Larzen was a cheap shot in his book, it was very likely that he didn&rsquo;t feel the need to mention her. At times like this, I was forced to realize, yet again, that Diablo&rsquo;s standards were pretty weird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Larzen guy was so strong as to be called a Majin. According to Hinata, there wasn&rsquo;t anyone stronger than Larzen in the Western Nations. To call someone like that a cheap shot, Diablo had some odd measures. I needed to educate him more about this kind of common sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trying to memorize all these points, I ordered a second cup of coffee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shuna, Hinata and Benimaru were having black tea with cakes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Uh, Benimaru, even you ordered it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">In that case, I wanted one too. Fruit cake was the best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to persuade Souei to order some too, but he ordered &ldquo;hot coffee&rdquo; from the staff. The waitress was blushing as she left. Souei didn&rsquo;t seem to notice, drinking the coffee without adding anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guy sure looked handsome just sipping his cup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I was feeling a close kinship to Benimaru, who enjoys sweets, I got the detailed report from Souei, the perfect handsome man.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That was how it went down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s report was done by the time I finished the second cup of coffee. I shared everything Souei saw through &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; with everyone else as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like Souei managed to draw out all his opponents&rsquo; tricks. Even though his target was an amazing beauty, Souei didn&rsquo;t spare any punches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This kind of reminded me. There was some online game in the past where you could cheat through game exploits. You could change your health points to infinite, giving your opponent the hope of winning while you grinned behind the screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">I&rsquo;m so close to winning</span><span class="c1">&mdash;that was the most sinister thing to make your opponent think. And your opponent would try so hard during the fight, using every last one of their items.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s exactly what Souei did, but he must have been trying to get relevant information about the culprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fine, this was not a video game we were talking about here. Moreover, espionage was all about testing out what your opponent had in store. So, Souei did nothing wrong. In fact, I should be praising him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good work, Souei, you sure are amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I tried out some methods I learned from Rimuru-sama, it was surprisingly effective. Indeed, at times, it is important to pretend as though I am having trouble in battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Eh-eh&hellip;eh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Oh yeah, now that he&rsquo;d mentioned it, I </span><span class="c4 c8">did</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;say something like that to him. I recalled that it might have been the plot of some spy movies&hellip;or was it video games? Didn&rsquo;t really matter since I seemed to have forgotten about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Sorry for calling you sinister just now,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I apologized to Souei internally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahaha, looks like it helped out, how wonderful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not entirely, I am still not strong enough. Three of my &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; were eliminated by her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-is that so? Anyway, now we&rsquo;ve got dirt on them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Please leave interrogation work to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Interrogation, eh? Uh&mdash;what to do now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I was mulling it over, Hinata interjected: &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to say this, but I imagine this will come out in time anyway, so I&rsquo;m just gonna bring it up with you guys. Souei-san&rsquo;s opponent, that woman, was one of my subordinates. Although I do not know what sort of power she has hidden, her Skills were surprisingly problematic. No wonder Lamar was beaten. With bullets appearing so close to him, he probably wasn&rsquo;t able to react.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So who is this guy called Lamar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, sorry. That guy used to be my subordinate, an ex-&lsquo;Three Martial Sages&rsquo;. He lost to that woman called Glenda and became her subordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Hinata had thought it was nothing, most people at the venue were speechless. It went without saying that this Skill was problematic to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata gave a rough explanation, saying that the assassin&rsquo;s strength was at &lsquo;Sage&rsquo; level, and was strong enough to battle a &lsquo;Demon Lord Breed&rsquo;. No wonder she was that ridiculously strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She sent one of Souei&rsquo;s &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; flying, was she using a grenade?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you mean the exploding ball?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like magic. I assumed that it was a weapon from another world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. It is likely that the individual &lsquo;Glenda&rsquo; used mana to craft it. It may be slightly different, but with Skills such as &lsquo;Weapon Specification&rsquo;, one can construct weapons from memory.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">W-weapon specification? So not only does she have sniper skills, she even had a trump card like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, if it was the authentic &lsquo;Weapon Specification&rsquo;, she would&rsquo;ve been able to reconstruct weapons from her memory perfectly. Yet what Glenda had recreated didn&rsquo;t seem delicate enough, and could only act as a pale imitation. Nonetheless, it still posed a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought so as well. Even though I&rsquo;ve not seen the real thing, it was just like how it is described in the movie. In other words, Glenda could be an &lsquo;Otherworlder&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think that may be the case, because she seems to have used her memory to recreate these weapons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I proudly explained this, Hinata looked at me suspiciously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Uh, busted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had yet to publicly disclose the existence of Wisdom King Raphael-san. Right now, I could only try to play dumb. I shouldn&rsquo;t have pretended that I knew all of these things. I tried to come up with an excuse to deal with Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s instinct! When you reach my level, your instincts become super sharp.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My words evoked looks of admiration from Benimaru and the others. It really warmed my heart, but I also kept on peeking at Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never mind. Putting that aside, can I interrogate her as well? If it is truly Glenda, I have something to ask her. Sare and Grigori both haven&rsquo;t returned. I&rsquo;m guessing she may know what has happened to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Looks like she ignored me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If she had things to ask Glenda, she should go ahead. We weren&rsquo;t going to hide anything anymore, unlike what Shion did last time&mdash;that was too </span><span class="c15 c4 c8">excessive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda&rsquo;s claims suggest that she had fought against Diablo in the past, but she managed to run away early on. As for the matter regarding Prince Elric, it actually didn&rsquo;t concern us anymore. That&rsquo;s why, if she was willing to be honest with us, we didn&rsquo;t plan on doing any harm to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Moreover, Souei said that he had already let her have a taste of fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not physically, but mentally. Surely, Glenda&#39;s pride must be in tatters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, whether we should let her go was also a difficult choice. She was stronger than we expected, so it would be dangerous to just let her run wild. In any case, it didn&rsquo;t seem right to hand her over to the Ingracia Kingdom. For now, I figured we should keep her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, are you coming with us?&rdquo; I asked Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then do indulge me,&rdquo; she nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyhow, depending on her attitude, we would decide what to do after we checked up on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On that note, we decided to switch venues.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;By the way, I was the one to pay the bill at the cafe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yesterday as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t really understand why Hinata slipped her bill to me. Should I forgive her with my generous heart, or should I be salty about it? But then again, I didn&rsquo;t want to be considered stingy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">To be annoyed by something as minor as this, I must be a petty bourgeoisie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On my way home from Ingracia, those were the thoughts running through my head.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, Head Knight&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once we met up with Souei&rsquo;s &lsquo;Clone&rsquo;, we went home together. Glenda, who had been in his custody, woke up as well and shouted upon seeing Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were not in some interrogation chamber, but a normal reception hall. Benimaru and Souei stood guard beside me, and Hinata was there too. Shuna prepared some tea for us to drink while we interrogated her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long time no see, Glenda, you seem well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata spoke first as she greeted Glenda with a cold eye. She was, as usual, merciless against her enemies. Glenda was rather nervous, but she quickly regained her cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! Looks like I&rsquo;m done for, then. Kill me if you must. When a spy is captured, it always ends up like that, one way or another.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She still managed to say something like that without shame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Silence. You shall only answer Rimuru-sama&#39;s questions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei pointedly said without any trace of sympathy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, shall I cut off this woman&rsquo;s limbs as punishment to make her behave better?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Please don&rsquo;t.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Souei was really going to do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No no no, even though we have healing potions&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, so you are saying that we should make her feel pain a couple of times? I didn&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No! I wanted to say that we shouldn&rsquo;t overdo it even </span><span class="c4 c8">with</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the healing potions!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Seriously, could you not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Shuna was agreeing with a smile, Hinata was eyeing me hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t intend to do that kind of thing to a woman. Moreover, Glenda didn&rsquo;t seem so stubborn as to not reveal anything. Perhaps with negotiation, we could get her to reveal the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Glenda-san. Nice to meet you, I suppose? I&rsquo;m Demon Lord Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Hello. I am Glenda. Subordinate to Hinata-sama over there, one of the &lsquo;Three Martial Sages&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda seemed to understand that there was no use retorting to Souei or trying to negotiate. Perhaps she felt it would just be better to answer my questions, starting off straight-forward by introducing herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda knew Diablo, so I figured that she must have escaped knowing she wouldn&rsquo;t win. Even among those people who vigorously asked for their lives to be taken, few earnestly wished to die. I was sure that she still had a strong will to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was also curious about why Glenda betrayed Hinata. Even if she didn&rsquo;t reveal the identity of the employer behind this assassination, she might reveal some other information. In any case, I didn&rsquo;t know the extent to which she would come clean, so let&rsquo;s just ask as many things as we could.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After settling down with that idea, I posed the first question in a calm tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were going to assassinate Prince Elric, is that correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were going to create the illusion that it was my doing to chase us out of the Western Nations, is that why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps. I didn&rsquo;t ask for the reasons. Someone just ordered me to do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, she didn&rsquo;t seem to be lying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can I ask the next questions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata&rsquo;s question made Glenda tense up nervously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you going to ask?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I put you in charge of the business hub cities, gave you the freedom of operating in an environment where you wouldn&rsquo;t be bound, and told you &lsquo;not to trust words of merchants&rsquo; easily. But you were already bribed at that point, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No comment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were going to betray us from the start, weren&rsquo;t you? Was it from someone&rsquo;s order?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;No comment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I figure that your employer is probably also running the council behind the scenes, so what&rsquo;s his true identity?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have been onto you for some time. When the council took action, sometimes, it seemed as though they knew the plans of the Western Saints Church. Obviously, there was a traitor, and you were the most suspicious. I was waiting for an opportunity to take care of you. If you are willing to tell me who your employer is, I may lighten your sentence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just say? No comment!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? Then let me ask you this one last thing, do you believe in Ruminas-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, there&rsquo;s no such thing as God in this world. As opposed to believing that, you might as well believe in money&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next second, Hinata unsheathed her rapier. A sharp clang rang out as my sword stopped her rapier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on, Hinata! Not her neck. Are you not just interrogating, but actually trying to kill her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s not what I have in mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Liar! I can see the bloodlust burning in your eyes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, I couldn&rsquo;t be careless for one second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, all Hinata wanted was to kill her. Thankfully, I was on guard and able to react, or we could have lost a valuable source of information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Rimuru-sama, I can use her to test my resurrection magic,&rdquo; Shuna said with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, Rimuru. I can also use the god&rsquo;s miracle &lsquo;Resurrection&rsquo;. There is no problem at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t tell if this was all an act or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Shuna, even Hinata said something that outrageous. I suppose it was fine to kill, if you could revive her, but it just didn&rsquo;t sit right with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;That&rsquo;s how I felt, but to be honest, I was willing to let them go ahead and do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyway, Hinata, let me handle this for a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time to switch out the contestant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not gonna end well if I were to let it continue. For now, Hinata needed to take a chill pill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, it was my turn again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Come on, Wisdom King Raphael-san, it is time for you to shine!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&mdash;Understood.&gt;&gt; Raphael-san readily agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I began to quote Raphael-san&rsquo;s words verbatim, &ldquo;It is futile to ask a professional hitman like yourself to divulge information. Therefore, you merely need to listen to what I have to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Oh, I see.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If we said something to shake her confidence, we could derive some information from her body language?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Try to keep up your poker face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah! Don&rsquo;t look down to me like that, it goes without saying!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Hmm, Glenda accepted the challenge. So, who is gonna be the winner of this contest? </span><span class="c1">I thought to myself, as if I were part of the audience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Unique Skills are often etched onto one&rsquo;s soul, you are no exception; your Skill is deeply imprinted upon it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, that&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard of that, so what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, during the meeting just now, many councilors were corrupted by their &lsquo;desire&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those &lsquo;desires&rsquo; were forcibly implanted, some Skills can have an influence on one&rsquo;s soul, so I assume they must have been affected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Glenda, you were also affected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Luckily you had your Unique Skill protecting your soul, so it wasn&rsquo;t corrupted completely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She probably couldn&rsquo;t deny what I said. Glenda glared at me silently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, that was the first time I heard about it, as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But even for such an impressive Unique Skill, there are still people who can tell its existence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;You mean like the &lsquo;Appraisal Eye&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, like Demon Lord Milim&rsquo;s notorious &lsquo;Dragon Eyes&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t know how it actually works, but wasn&rsquo;t there a rumor that &lsquo;Demon Lord Milim can see through everything&rsquo;? It isn&rsquo;t far from the truth, with a mere glance, Milim can tell what type of Skills her opponent has.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was true. Though, that said, she couldn&rsquo;t reveal the details of the Skills if her opponent didn&rsquo;t activate them. She could, nonetheless, still tell the strength of her opponent&rsquo;s Skills and identify whether it was an Extra Skill or a Unique Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when a single person possessed more than two Unique Skills, it became hard to discern whether you were dealing with one extremely powerful Unique Skill, or multiple&mdash;the details seemed to be more difficult to obtain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had similar Skills myself. The accuracy of my &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; had increased, and now I could vaguely read my opponent&rsquo;s Skills. Furthermore, I also learned of ways to counter this and keep mine hidden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was like how Guy Crimson disguised his magicule capacity. When I met Guy, I thought that there was no need to actively conceal Skills that I wasn&rsquo;t currently using.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was not the case at all. A trained &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; could discover what Skills you had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In retrospect, I was lucky. With my four Ultimate Skills back then, Guy probably saw me as a rival that should not be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could not let &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; be known to the public. I must act cautiously in the future. I had thought it was impossible to hide your Skills, when in fact, it could be done. With enough practice, I seemed to be able to fool analytical Skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though it wasn&#39;t perfect yet, after experimenting with many things, this was the conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What are you on about? I </span><span class="c4 c8">do</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;have a Unique Skill. So how is it that, thanks to it, I haven&rsquo;t been corrupted by &lsquo;desire&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had paused for a second, when Glenda asked anxiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She probably couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, after hearing that she had been under the influence of &lsquo;desire&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wanted to answer her quickly, but Raphael-san&rsquo;s explanation was a bit too difficult. It was taking some time to digest the information before regurgitating it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Proposal. Activate &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo;? YES/NO&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I forgot this was available. I wished I had used that from the beginning; I quietly chose YES.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From here on out, we moved on to the speed round with Glenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whether you have been corrupted by desire or not, is none of my business, but there&rsquo;s one thing I can say for sure from this. Your employer has a very powerful Unique Skill. Am I correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No comment&mdash;even though I want to say this, I have to admit that you are correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. Then let us continue. There was a guy who was corrupted by &lsquo;desire&rsquo; during the nation founding festival as well. That man&rsquo;s name was Kai. He was defeated by Shuna today. Only a few of the merchants were affected while the rest of the guests remained fine. In order to spread the influence to multiple individuals, I figure the probability of the caster being present in close proximity was very high.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may be a different case for someone as completely corrupted as Kai, but as the distance increased, the effect of the Skill would weaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Masayuki&rsquo;s Skill was very strong too. However, it had a synergistic effect mostly due to the power of the rumor mill. From the basis of his Skill, rumors spread his influence further even without his notice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the effect of &lsquo;desire&rsquo; purely relied on the power of the Skill. You could probably intensify the influence with the clever use of sophistry and the like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To put it simply, it was highly likely that this individual had attended the nation founding festival. This did make a lot of sense. In this way, I could only think of one suspect. I had found the individual suspicious for some time and had asked Souei to investigate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mariabell Rosso, have you heard of the name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Raphael-san sure was straight to the point. It picked out the name directly from Souei&rsquo;s investigation report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;UH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seemingly trying to conceal information til the bitter end, this was the only reaction Glenda made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It must have meant that she knew something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;My &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; is pretty good. Not only can I detect Skills, I can also see when someone is trying to hide something. Plus, I sensed an unusual presence during the </span><span class="c4">nation founding</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;festival. And one of them was this young girl called Mariabell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda&rsquo;s face looked worse as she listened to my words. Cold sweat seemed to be dripping down her cheeks, or was it just normal sweat? Either way, Glenda looked very nervous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-how did you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said Mariabell Rosso?&rdquo; Hinata interjected once more, cutting off Glenda. &ldquo;Rosso&mdash;it must be the Rosso family. So that&rsquo;s how it was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;EHH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, she would have been mad after I told her not to speak. Yet from her expression, that didn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. After all, the line &ldquo;All of the mysteries have been solved&rdquo; was written on Hinata&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, it was obvious from Glenda&#39;s attitude that something was amiss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Granbell Rosso. He is the progenitor of the Rosso family. He was a great man that used to be a &lsquo;Chosen Hero&rsquo;. Glenda, surely you knew this as well, that the true identity of the leader of the &lsquo;Seven Celestial Saints&rsquo;, the Sun Sage, was Granbell&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected, it looked like Hinata had arrived at the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words have revealed the people behind this whole ordeal and their specific role in the matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You meant the &lsquo;Seven Celestials&rsquo;, those people from before? I heard that they were all killed, so that guy called Granbell is still alive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nicolas said that he has sent him six feet under, but that strange man has led the Western Saints Church for over hundreds of years. It wouldn&rsquo;t be strange if he had managed to escape his certain death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell seemed to be the caster of the &lsquo;desire&rsquo; Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was also the Great Elder Granbell Rosso&mdash;no, the head of the &lsquo;Seven Celestials&rsquo;, Gran.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, if Granbell really was this monster that had lived for hundreds of years, then the likelihood of him dominating the council was very high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Gran is behind all this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It must be him. He&rsquo;s probably manipulating powerful individuals such as Mariabell in an attempt to achieve something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We ignored Glenda at this point and began to share what information each of us had our hands on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The answer to the mystery was almost out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda had no more value to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dammit! I didn&rsquo;t say anything, how come you all know so much! What kind of joke is this, isn&rsquo;t this the same as me revealing everything&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Umm&mdash;what bad luck. I can only say that you have met too strong an opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Wisdom King Raphael-san is ridiculously competent, it&rsquo;s not someone you can hope to rival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if you think that way, it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, Glenda. You meet a traitor&rsquo;s end, and deservedly so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damnit, if this continues, I-I&rsquo;m gonna die&hellip;&rdquo; Glenda moaned, her face now ashen. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started to feel bad for her. I didn&rsquo;t really plan to kill her. I was thinking about handing her to the Ingracia Kingdom after getting the information, but surely, she would be executed now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought Glenda would be able to escape, but seeing how scared she was, the person pulling her strings must&rsquo;ve been very powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this Mariabell really that strong?&rdquo; I asked out of curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s not the issue. &lsquo;Summoned Ones&rsquo; like us are shackled by a curse that prevents us from disobeying. Therefore, if our summoners thought that we had betrayed them, they would crush our souls. That will be my end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ah, that&rsquo;s just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you weren&rsquo;t betraying Ruminas-sama out of your own free will, it&rsquo;s just that you can&rsquo;t disobey?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About that, it&rsquo;s more complex than you think. I wanted to beg for mercy from God, but Granbell-sama&rsquo;s eyes were sharp and saw everything. To be honest, I had no choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, I felt an inkling of sympathy towards Glenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata was still glaring at her coldly, but her fury didn&rsquo;t appear as intense as before. Her killing intent seemed to have subsided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, there is no use seeking refuge in God, either. People with their soul shattered cannot be resurrected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ah ah, so Hinata has her kind side as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though she still seemed cold, she was actually thinking about ways to save Glenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I wonder, could I unbind the curse?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. No problem, do you wish to lift it? YES/NO&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ara, here we go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, we undid the curse with ease.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over. That girl&mdash;Mariabell&mdash;can read all my emotions. Even if I had no intent of betraying her, she will still know and eliminate me,&rdquo; Glenda lamented regretfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing her in this mood, I told her that the curse has been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh&hellip;what now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyhow, don&rsquo;t worry about it. We are done with you and you can live your life freely. They probably think you are dead as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no, that&rsquo;s not it. You managed to unbind the &lsquo;curse&rsquo; that dominated me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, sort of. I&rsquo;m not going to further elaborate. Just remember that I won&rsquo;t be so kind in the future if you stand against us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose I will turn a blind eye as well. I&rsquo;d catch a lot of flak for harming people released by Rimuru. However, remember this. You betrayed Ruminas-sama, the Western Saints Church will never forgive you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda was strong and posed quite the threat. Despite this, now that she was no longer under Mariabell&rsquo;s control, there was no reason why she would antagonize us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she were to insist on remaining hostile towards us, I would just take care of her in time. I didn&rsquo;t feel all that troubled by her actions, so I decided to forgive her this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata also seemed to have decided to let Glenda off the hook. Since I had forgiven her, she probably couldn&rsquo;t do something that meant otherwise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some sense, Glenda was merely following orders. She was not making decisions herself, but was acting under the restrictive control of the &lsquo;Curse&rsquo;. Therefore, we should be light with her punishment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, you are free to go. Feel free to stay in our nation if you feel like it, but if you were to cause any trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-wait a minute&mdash;no, please hold on a second! Are you really letting me go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, killing you doesn&rsquo;t seem all that meaningful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since Rimuru-sama is letting you live, we don&rsquo;t have any reason to oppose the idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You alone won&rsquo;t pose too much of a threat anyway,&rdquo; Souei and Benimaru added on to my words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though the way they put it was rather off, they seemed to be okay with this verdict. They probably felt that Glenda posed no threat. While that may sound harsh, it was, in truth, the reality of the situation. She didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against a serious Souei, and she obviously wouldn&rsquo;t win against Benimaru. Glenda herself seemed to be mindful of keeping her life. She wouldn&rsquo;t be stupid enough to challenge someone she couldn&rsquo;t beat. That was why we were fine with letting her go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Facing me, Glenda suddenly dropped to her knees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words she then spilled were shocking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I have a request! I will tell you everything I know, so can you please hire me? I&rsquo;ll do any dirty work you have, anything, please!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Benimaru and I looked at each other, dumbstruck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">What should I do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">It&rsquo;s your call.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were exchanging information with our eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if she wanted us to hire her, we didn&rsquo;t really have the money. My pocket money had increased by a lot, but we were still reviewing our executives&rsquo; paychecks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were a super sweat-shoppy corporation&mdash;I mean nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad to hear your enthusiasm, but we are still developing. We are slow in terms of designing systems, so there is no salary for now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You gotta be clear when it came to this type of question. It wouldn&rsquo;t help if I were to act rich, so I told her the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda was frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Be that as it may&mdash;what Glenda said next shocked us instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m used to that already. Even though I was a member of the Pope&rsquo;s Imperial Order and a member of the Holy Nation Ruberios, I wasn&rsquo;t getting paid anyway&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t expect that someone with such high status as the &lsquo;Three Martial Sages&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t even getting paid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As it turns out, everything was paid with actual goods; any money they had, was collected by themselves. However, they could use their reputation to get a national guest level of treatment in the Western Nations. They could also receive prizes for stopping crimes, and overall, it sounded like they were well off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, does that mean Hinata hasn&rsquo;t collected much money either?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">But didn&rsquo;t she spend a ton during the festival?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Tsk, yeah. In Ruberios, we promote the idea that everyone is equal, so we won&rsquo;t pay in cash in public trades. Everyone just uses goods as currency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was surprised, but also reassured. If a kingdom as long-lived as Ruberios could work without paying salaries, surely, we were not in a hurry to design our own systems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, Hinata was in charge of running the Holy Knight Order, with the additional role as the head knight of the imperial order. She seemed to be able to access the national treasury to some extent. With the additional earnings from fulfilling monster contracts throughout the day, she could earn plenty of money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you are still asking me to pay even when you are making so much money?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you care so much! It&rsquo;s called being frugal, frugal!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was willing to spend money treating the kids but was super stingy with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, have I given any bonus to Myourmiles?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought to myself, but I figured it would be too much trouble and decided not to dwell on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Despite how I look, I&rsquo;m quite infamous among the Western Nations,&rdquo; Glenda exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, even if you let me go, I probably won&rsquo;t find a single job offer. After all, most nations probably wouldn&rsquo;t dare to hire me. The adventurer lifestyle doesn&rsquo;t really suit me either. Moreover, this place probably has the highest level of culture around. I&rsquo;ll be satisfied if you just provide me with the basic necessities,&rdquo; Glenda said with apparent desperation. She didn&rsquo;t seem to be lying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This did seem reasonable. No matter how you saw it, a &lsquo;Martial Sage&rsquo; who was chased out of Ruberios would appear to be a traitor to the world&rsquo;s eyes. There was no way any nation would dare to hire someone as dangerous as that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if she were to hide her identity and become an adventurer, it would still be a life of unending fear. If she were to expose her identity accidentally, either Ruberios or Granbell would likely send people after her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either way, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to live a peaceful life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, you probably will have a hard time surviving if no one wants to help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell me about it. So please, Demon Lord-sama! You may not believe me, but I swear I&rsquo;ll pledge my loyalty to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">How could I believe you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to be honest, you couldn&rsquo;t exactly hate her. She was like the unfortunate woman that appeared in the spy movies. You just couldn&rsquo;t leave her behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, can you handle this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Rimuru-sama wishes so, I will not object.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be counting on you. It&rsquo;ll be troublesome if she were to betray us, so please prepare accordingly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. Her combat prowess outshines Souka, therefore she can be under my command and help expand our secret services.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A secret service that exclusively recruits problem children?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, sort of. I want to use what is available in front of me as opposed to spending the effort recruiting otherwise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even Diablo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;had gone to search for subordinates. It would be unfair to stop Souei now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I let him go ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then you shall handle this in its entirety! Discuss with Myourmiles about your budget.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The matter was settled quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi, how can you call me a problem child when I&rsquo;m right here&hellip;&rdquo; I heard Glenda muttering. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">If you have a problem with that, try winning over my trust first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, I decided to recruit Glenda.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I asked Souei to manage Glenda, but before that, I needed her to give us all the information she knew. Since this was no longer an interrogation, we simply had a normal conversation over dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You grab one of these wooden tags with the type of meals written on it and exchange it for food at the window over there. There are three different types of meals, which we switch up everyday. There are special meal sets as well. If you were to become an officer of some sort, you can order any food you like.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh, is that so? They have been preparing meals for me every time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They always seemed to have a lot of fun eating, but had never used the wooden tag to order anything. But this was the lieutenants&rsquo; canteen, someone would prepare meals for them even if they didn&rsquo;t order anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The creation of new dishes by Shion&rsquo;s and Gobchi&rsquo;s own kitchens was a story for another day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is our most popular dish. You need to make an appointment using your effort points or come early to wait in line to get it. It&rsquo;s a specially made dish,&rdquo; Shuna explained with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was gonna say that the dessert in the combo made it seem very extravagant. I realized why that was the case after hearing her explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can all have this set.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;ve ordered people to reserve them for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw that Benimaru and Souei both were ordering the special meal. I was caught on the fact that Souei just said something about &lsquo;Ordering people to reserve them&rsquo;. Could it be that he had ordered his subordinates to wait in line for him? I should probably just believe in the idea that he wouldn&rsquo;t be stupid enough to order people to fight over meals at the canteen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the meals served to our table, we began to dine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s talk&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I turned to Glenda as I was about to ask her something. There I saw that her eyes had lit up and all her attention was focused on the meal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was really delicious. No wonder it was listed as a special. I supposed it was best to talk about happier topics during the meal. So I questioned her after we ate.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we finished dining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I used to put money above all, but that thought was changed today. From today onward, I&rsquo;m gonna live for points!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Just to clarify, in case you were being serious, they are not that easy to collect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">But, fine, whatever. If it made her put in her best efforts, I&rsquo;d say </span><span class="c4 c8">go for it</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What secrets do you know? Do not hide anything, tell us everything,&rdquo; Souei prompted Glenda, which finally got her to open up about the secrets she knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The contents she revealed gave us a surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, regarding the council. It was under the control of the five leaders of an organization called the Five Great Elders. The head of the Five Great Elders was the aforementioned Granbell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the remaining four, to our surprise, we learned that today&rsquo;s prime suspect, count Gavan, was one of them. And in contrast, the duke of the Rosteia Kingdom, Johann, was also a member of the Five Great Elders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How come the Five Great Elders were in disagreement with each other?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was Mariabell&#39;s plan. She intentionally organized an opposition while also keeping someone aligned with the majority view. In truth, this was her faking disputes, but to the people involved, this was a real battle where the stakes were life or death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see&hellip; Was she doing so to make her organization more effective?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, it could seem to be efficient to make an organization with one sole goal. However, it was likely to eventually stagnate and become a breeding bed of corruption.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, it was often seen that one bad leader could bring down a whole business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, if Johann managed to win my trust, it would&rsquo;ve been easier for them to keep tabs on me. For them, it would have been great if they were able to eliminate me, but now, they would probably make plans for Johann to conspire from inside the council.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That feels so shady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I seriously don&rsquo;t want to deal with these people, I want to burn them all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was annoying just to hear about these kinds of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was probably how the nobles operated, to eliminate people whose alignment was unclear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I might have trusted Johann if I had not heard about this information. It was the correct choice to have absolved Glenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other two members of the five were the count of Cidel, who was in charge of guarding the northern border of the Ingracia Kingdom, and King Dolan, who was from a small kingdom in the west. His nation was a military nation guarded by soldiers of the Deran family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these two power houses stationed in Ingracia, it was obvious how much thought Granbell had put into the structure of this land. It was next to the Holy Nation Ruberios and far from the Great Jura Forest. It would be the safest place on this continent. Granbell thought it was the most suitable location to act as the center hub of politics and economy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But why is he antagonizing me? I&rsquo;m such a friendly demon lord, after all,&rdquo; I blurted out without thinking, and, for whatever reason, everyone looked at me with surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh? With all of the provocations you&rsquo;ve issued, it&rsquo;s enough to turn anyone against you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought you were provoking them as well. Diablo mentioned that Rimuru-sama wishes to dominate the world economy. I thought that you were going to control the council as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">What do you mean? Also, you were discussing that with Diablo?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought so too, and figured intelligence gathering was a part of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Yeah, I can&rsquo;t deny that it was one of the goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Surely it can&rsquo;t be that you have been doing this unconsciously the whole time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Even Hinata is saying so!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never knew this was how everyone thought of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-not at all. Although I can&rsquo;t deny that I had absolutely no intention to do that, I also wasn&rsquo;t that anxious to get it done! That&rsquo;s why I wanted to negotiate peacefully with others&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my excuse, Hinata let out a stunned sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I doubt there are any good-natured merchants that would allow some new guys to just come around and mess with their trades, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Uh, she has a point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s alright. We will probably have to confront each other at some point. Let&rsquo;s work towards controlling the economic activities of the Western Nations from now on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I had that idea in mind from the very start. However, my duty is to fortify defense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I shall go investigate the Rosso clan and the Five Great Elders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a good thing to be able to see our enemies clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As our new companion, Glenda, said: &ldquo;You guys sure are lucky to have gotten all this for free.&rdquo; Now we knew what to work towards from now on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, you guys should be cautious as well. Pay extra attention. Don&rsquo;t accidentally get sandwiched by Yuuki and the Rosso clan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru nodded as Souei also agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We still needed to wait on Yuuki&rsquo;s side while we fought an intelligence and economic warfare against the Rossos. We didn&rsquo;t have to shed any blood for now, so it was relatively more relaxed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a part of me that felt as though I was worrying too much, so I decided to end the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Hinata suddenly interjected. &ldquo;Yuuki and the Rosso clan? Why are you cautious about Yuuki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was confused for a second and quickly realized that I had forgotten to bring this matter up to Hinata&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s just that I thought about it a lot, and the only person I could come up with who knew about my identity as a &lsquo;Reincarnated One&rsquo;, my relationship with Shizu-san, and is able to leak this information to the eastern merchants, was&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, only Yuuki fits the bill?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, that&rsquo;s right. By the way, that majin called Laplace from that moderate clown gang, I&rsquo;m guessing that Roy, who was pretending to be the demon lord, may have been beaten by him. No guarantee though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, thanks anyway. I&rsquo;m not interested in that matter, but I can&rsquo;t just sit back and watch if he&rsquo;s hostile against us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like Hinata was treating Laplace and the others as enemies. She gave off a chillingly cold laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Oooh, how horrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really had to watch myself to not piss off Hinata.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After disclosing what I discovered to Hinata, she stood up and made an effort to leave&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;U-uh, about that&hellip;&rdquo; Glenda opened up timidly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looked like she had something else to say to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it? Feel free to speak what&rsquo;s on your mind. Did you just remember something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as I finished asking, Glenda dropped the bombshell of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were talking about the leader of the Freedom Association, Yuuki, weren&#39;t you? That guy&rsquo;s connected to the Five Great Elders Johann. He&rsquo;s completely under the control of Mariabell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Eh? Yuuki is being controlled?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bold enough to make jokes under these circumstances.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I suppose so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Eh, why didn&rsquo;t you say something so important earlier?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-well, technically speaking, I am Granbell&rsquo;s direct subordinate&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were two people who had authority over Glenda. They seemed to be Granbell and Mariabell. And Glenda&rsquo;s orders mainly came from Granbell. Therefore, Glenda never really had the chance to guess Mariabell&rsquo;s thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t sure if Glenda knew anything else. She claimed she told us everything she knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, I heard Mariabell had subordinates known as the &lsquo;Blood Shadows&rsquo; who specialized in doing the dirty work for the Rossos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Shuna mumbled, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another problem now. If Yuuki was manipulated, he may have leaked secrets of Rimuru-sama involuntarily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata also fell deep into her own thoughts. It looked like we needed to re-evaluate the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&hellip;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">How rare, even Raphael-san fell silent. This is really rare</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c15 c4 c8">&nbsp;if even Raphael-san can&rsquo;t find the answer, then maybe it&#39;s no use for me to bother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, the most important thing was to let the thought go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I couldn&rsquo;t figure out anything now, I would just think about it at another time. Just like during the exams, it would be better to put harder questions on hold and solve them later. You shouldn&rsquo;t waste all your valuable time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anyways, let&rsquo;s list Yuuki as a suspect and see what happens next&mdash;eh, hold on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki always acted very cautiously, so he probably wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to us on his own. However, it would be different if he had been manipulated by someone else. If his controller was Mariabell, who wished to antagonize us, wouldn&rsquo;t that just topple everything we assumed before?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I may, if Yuuki can&rsquo;t disobey Mariabell&rsquo;s orders, is it possible that he would disregard his own stance and do something unnatural?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Yes, that was it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mariabell wanted to eliminate all of us. So, she could utilize Yuuki to plot against us. In other words, we would most likely be cornered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that make things pretty bad for us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They will need to collect intelligence, so the Rosso clan probably won&rsquo;t do anything, however&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nii-san and Souei have a point. Aren&rsquo;t you going to go explore some ruins with the vice president of the Freedom Association, Kagali-san? Perhaps they have some devious scheme behind it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Umm, it seemed as though everyone shared the same view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might have been too optimistic about our situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&#39;s no need to worry about that&mdash;it&rsquo;s too early to say anything. Mariabell&mdash;the Rosso clan&mdash;they would sever ties with Yuuki and claim that they had no idea about his actions. They could push all of the blame to the Freedom Association and let us fight it out with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That way, Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s plan would be compromised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If we were to just observe, we may lose our chance to strike first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Umm&mdash;with that being said, we were already very cautious. The town was heavily guarded, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to instigate our residents, either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">If that is the case&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Proposal, we can intentionally show weak points to lure out the enemies.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">That&rsquo;s it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Should we cancel the ruin exploration?&rdquo; Benimaru proposed. I shook my head in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, we can use this to our advantage. If we were to cancel it, Milim would be super annoyed. Let&rsquo;s proceed as planned, but we should be prepared to confront our enemies no matter what happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Milim seemed to be looking forward to the expedition. It was like a hike where she could temporarily escape from her homework. Cancelling it now would likely anger her. That would be troublesome. If possible, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to cancel the expedition either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be dangerous?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Milim would come. I also want to bring Shion as my bodyguard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, that&rsquo;s no problem. Shion wasn&rsquo;t too happy about staying behind this time. This would surely cheer her up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Benimaru had no problems with the plan, Shion would be my bodyguard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will also bring Gobta and Ranga along. Shouldn&rsquo;t that be enough force?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. Leave the town&rsquo;s security to me in case anything happens during Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s departure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will help Nii-san. First, I will fortify the &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will be in charge of surveillance and see if anyone acts suspiciously in the different nations. Especially the Five Great Elders mentioned by Glenda.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you guys. Veldora is in the labyrinth; ask him for help if anything were to happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I finished, everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I will report back to Ruminas-sama. You are really careless sometimes, so be extra cautious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You talk too much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After she finished chatting with me, Hinata used magic to return home. Even though she was usually very cold, Hinata would occasionally show some care for me in her own way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Is this what a tsundere is?</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer, no.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Ah, yeah, totally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was daydreaming a bit, but oh the cruel reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyways, our plan was settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we had to do was to be prepared for action when the day arrived.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Gonna"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Chapter 5</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Let"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.vkcsk6frqbv4"><span class="c22 c4">Epilogue</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c26 c4">The Final Winner</span></p><hr><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c26 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yuuki had obtained Mariabell&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d told us this from the start.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, didn&rsquo;t I already tell you that it wasn&rsquo;t possible? It was thanks to my method that even Mariabell was caught in the loop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it was awfully tiring for me to keep all my subordinates away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Yuuki was fighting Rimuru, in order to preserve the secret of Yuuki&rsquo;s power, Kagali had tried to draw the attention of her crew. She was afraid that Rimuru would see through her act if she did anything suspicious, so she had been very careful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting seen through by others wouldn&rsquo;t even pose any problems, in Yuuki&#39;s personal opinion. Even if his enemies found out about his ability to nullify Skills, they still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to counter it easily. It was an ace in the hole for Yuuki, but definitely not his trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I did that because I had faith in you. We managed to pull through successfully anyway, so just quit complaining.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem to have robbed Mariabell of her power, was that part of your plan as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I mean, sort of. The Deadly Sins are the strongest Skills among the Unique Skills. That&rsquo;s why I always wanted one. I heard that the amount of &lsquo;Desire&rsquo; one has is what fuels the power of &lsquo;Greedy One&rsquo;, therefore I would be the better owner of it. And that&rsquo;s how things went.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can be really absurd sometimes. Normal people can&rsquo;t just rob other people&rsquo;s Skills, you know?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Probably. But this time it was the &lsquo;Greedy One&rsquo; that chose me. With that being said, I still can&rsquo;t win against that Demon Lord Rimuru with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;You have a point. That demon lord was beyond common sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously. But now, we can put the blame onto Mariabell for all our evil deeds. I get to walk free of any suspicion. For now, we&rsquo;ll have to quiet down, but we&rsquo;ll have more fun, nonetheless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Given how things have developed, rushing it wouldn&rsquo;t help. That demon lord really was meticulous, to the point of it being disgusting. I&rsquo;ve got quite a lot of complaints about our plan this time, but I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to accept it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali&rsquo;s complaint was mainly towards the destruction of the tomb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki explained to Rimuru that Mariabell committed suicide by turning on the engine reactor. He wanted to destroy the evidence. The explosion only covered the lowest level, and the damage was less severe than expected&mdash;that was Yuuki&rsquo;s explanation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth was that he detonated a pre-placed magic bomb, but he twisted the narrative by saying: &ldquo;The explosion was smaller because the residual energy within the engine reactor was relatively low.&rdquo; In order to make himself more believable, he had even scattered scraps of the actual engine reactor. No matter how their opponents were to question them, Yuuki was ready to lie until the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was what Kagali had a problem with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you plan to abandon the place anyway? Don&rsquo;t think about it too much,&rdquo; Yuuki reassured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">To Kagali, it was the city that she had lived in for a long time. After she had handled everything, she planned to turn it back into a lively city, like it was in the past. Yet now the most important part, the tomb, </span><span class="c4">was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;gone. No wonder why she was upset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;That&rsquo;s not true. This was still like our second home,&rdquo; Kagali shrugged, which Yuuki met with a bitter smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a point. But thanks to this, we have profited, nonetheless. Getting my name cleared was our goal in the first place. Moreover, we learnt that the &lsquo;Blood Shadows&rsquo; sent by Mariabell were capable of &lsquo;Holy Magic&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s a major breakthrough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. I noticed it too. The reason behind the Council&rsquo;s connection to the Western Saints Church was due to the secret true identity of the head of the Council of Five Elders .&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It was covered on the news as well. It was quite the hot topic for a while, as a matter of fact&mdash;the civil war of Farmus caused the reputation of the heroes to go downhill. It also heavily reduced the influence of the Council on the Western Saints Church. This also points to another fact! Mariabell&rsquo;s great-grandfather, Granbell Rosso, was probably one of the &lsquo;Seven Celestial Sages&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; As expected from Yuuki-sama, such sharp observation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali had keen observation as well. Yuuki&rsquo;s deduction was, in a sense, the same as what she&rsquo;d been suspecting. Therefore, she could now confirm the matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki then looked at Kagali with an evil smile on his face. &ldquo;I suppose, I can still handle this level of deduction. Compared to that, I found something of even greater significance, do you know what it is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked at Kagali as he finished, seemingly observing her reaction. Kagali only knew so much information, so she raised her hands as if saying, &ldquo;I give up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was trying to figure out Mariabell&rsquo;s operation this time. She was acting particularly hastily, wasn&rsquo;t she? Even if she had killed Demon Lord Rimuru, Veldora might&rsquo;ve come out to rain chaos. Manipulating the Chaos Dragon would also enrage Demon Lord Milim. Weren&rsquo;t you nervous as well? You were afraid that Milim would have seen through your disguise, right? I thought that she was being too reckless to have pitched herself against such a dangerous demon lord, as well as a &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve laid it out, it does sound a little&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was no way that Mariabell could have overlooked such risks. By her logic, every outcome should have had its solution planned out. Then, what would be the solution in this case?&rdquo; Yuuki looked straight at Kagali as he asked. He didn&rsquo;t actually have an answer, but instead was merely trying to organize his thoughts with the question raised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&hellip; My guess is that perhaps she was already certain that her own safety was ensured?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Perhaps she realized she had to make a sacrifice, and steeled her resolve to give up the minimum amount? She seemed to be afraid of Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s rise to power. Perhaps it would make sense for her to suffer some losses at this stage, in order to benefit in the long term&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Yuuki nodded with a &ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, in my opinion, there&rsquo;s no way that she would have resorted to those tactics had she not known how much sacrifice was required. It was most likely the opposite. If you could predict what level of damage your actions would cause, you would probably be able to tell the cost and benefit of your actions immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;And that would mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if Veldora and Milim were to lose control, Mariabell had a way to deal with both&mdash;I have sufficient evidence to back up that claim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And what would that be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it Granbell&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; At this point, Yuuki had already found the answer. A smile emerged on his face as he looked at Kagali. &ldquo;Who fought against Laplace at the Holy Land?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Demon Lord Valentine&mdash;AH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Kagali&rsquo;s reaction, Yuuki&rsquo;s smile widened with satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Demon Lord Valentine is already dead, yet among the Eight Star Demon Lords, there&rsquo;s another Valentine. Surely, the real demon lord is stronger than the fake one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even the deceased Valentine could stand toe-to-toe with me during my prime&hellip; That would mean&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The real deal is much stronger! In addition, I am certain that the demon lord&rsquo;s base is within the church&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you saying that Demon Lord Valentine is also the god Ruminas? No way, how can that be&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It </span><span class="c4 c8">can</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;be, and most likely is the case,&rdquo; Yuuki said with certainty as Kagali also realized the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see, that would explain&hellip; For someone like Granbell, it wouldn&rsquo;t be strange if he had known the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are correct. Mariabell was in on it as well. It was precisely because she knew that when she had made the judgement, believing that the god Ruminas would be there to protect the Western Nations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Yuuki&rsquo;s explanation, all of this made sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali could only accept it. There was no room for her to argue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, we need to design a new strategy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. But first, we will temporarily move our base of operations to &lsquo;The East&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehehe, you sure are a scary guy. Talking about keeping things quiet while also running around so energetically.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only natural, since I&rsquo;m gonna be the ruler of this world. Didn&rsquo;t I promise you guys already? I&rsquo;m gonna rule this world!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Hehe, hehehehe, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. Really, really looking forward to it. Clayman would be happy about it too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, that&rsquo;s why you need to actually assist me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for sure. And you too. Don&rsquo;t you dare betray us now, Yuuki-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t. I am definitely going to rule the world. And everyone will live happily ever after!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki and Kagali laughed, and laughed, and laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like playing a game, the majins conspired to take over the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To rule the world&mdash;such a childish ambition&mdash;one that they would stop at nothing to achieve&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We had taken out the Chaos Dragon and saved Milim&rsquo;s friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After going back to check, we discovered that the bottom floor of the ruin was buried. According to Yuuki, who seemed to be in one piece, Mariabell blew herself up upon being forced into desperation. She seemed to have wanted to take me down with her&mdash;</span><span class="c15 c4 c8">was she really going that far just to take care of me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon thinking so, that kind of made me sad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we were enemies, and I couldn&rsquo;t really help how things turned out&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was no use for me to constantly fall into this emotional low point. I needed to go talk to Kagali-san and see if we could restore the ruins. It would take some time, but we planned to dig out the entire bottom floor. We would do it one bit at a time, and display the devices dug out from the ruins. This castle was planned to be decorated into a museum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also planned to create more tracks for the &lsquo;Magic Train&rsquo; to connect here and make this a tourist site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn&rsquo;t sure how many years this would take, on top of the many issues I already had on my to-do list. The least that I could be sure of now, however, was that until we signed a nonaggression pact with the Eastern Empire, this would be the foremost frontline of the battlefield. Even though this was part of Milim&rsquo;s territory, we still couldn&rsquo;t be careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, we only planned to conduct the restoration work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The negotiations with the Council were proceeding smoothly as well. After our moderation of the Council members, their authority had reduced greatly. On the other hand, the Western Saints Church had flourished, and Yuuki, no longer under Mariabell&rsquo;s control, also grew more influential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With how things had developed, the Council called for a new unifying force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">And that would be us&mdash;or rather, me. The Tempest Federation had become the biggest faction within the Council. We had the Freedom Association led by Yuuki behind our back. The terms of such support were to provide funds for the Freedom Association, and in turn they declared their cooperation with</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">the </span><span class="c4">Tempest</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hinata also agreed to the matter. She justified that it would be beneficial for peace among the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I was able to cultivate great influence in the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On another note, I was glad that Yuuki could finally be washed off his suspicion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Thanks to that, we can confidently build a mutually supportive relationship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Negative. The suspicion is confirmed. Individual &ldquo;Yuuki Kagurazaka&rdquo; was indeed acting according to his own will.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Eh? Hold up, why didn&rsquo;t you say anything until now!?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Answer. Because that principle of action was convenient and available.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">That&rsquo;s why? No, I get it now, I finally get it now&hellip; Did Raphael-san not mention this for my sake?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;&hellip;&gt;&gt; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s all because I was too naive. I hesitated about whether to kill Mariabell or not. I should not have hesitated for the sake of the future. If she had tried to inflict harm on me, my doubt would have disappeared. But, since they hadn&rsquo;t really made too much trouble for us, I felt that it was unnecessary to kill her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was also Kai. I also felt that I had gone overboard, after killing him. That was also one of the reasons for me to be discouraged from doing the same to Mariabell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">I couldn&rsquo;t kill Mariabell&mdash;so &lsquo;You&rsquo; made the judgement to not tell me about that thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&hellip;Yes. I felt that it was necessary.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">How dare you act on your own&mdash;! </span><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t really say that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, just as Raphael-san predicted, Yuuki killed Mariabell without so much as a flinch. And with all the evidence successfully destroyed, he had nothing to worry about. Raphael-san must have thought someone like this would be easy to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had no reason to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I also felt frustrated. It was all because of my own incompetence that Raphael-san had to worry about me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Negative. That was not the case. I simply did not want Master to put too much mind on the matter.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c8">Thanks. For helping me avoid the guilt afterward too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I was happy about this outcome, I couldn&rsquo;t let this happen in the future. I had to face what was coming and make decisions based on my own will. Or else how would I be qualified to be Raphael&rsquo;s master? I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to grow if I always acted childish and relied on others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Always tell me the truth from now on</span><span class="c4">, I told Raphael. </span><span class="c15 c4 c8">And I will face it seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;Understood. As Master wishes.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter what Yuuki&rsquo;s motive was, I would crush his ambition. I was not alone on this journey; I had companions and a reliable partner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right? With Wisdom King Raphael, I wouldn&rsquo;t stray away from the right path. I believed this from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in that moment, while only just for a little, I thought I felt Raphael &ldquo;smile&rdquo; happily.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="You"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="Down"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="receive your spoiler free ticket here."></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.x83patd3kckv"><span class="c22 c4">Author&rsquo;s Afterword</span></h2><hr><h2 class="c12 c14" id="h.lmt2y3y4dm7"><span class="c4 c16"></span></h2><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Long time no see, everyone. This is Fuse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was going to forgo writing an afterword this time. The reason being that this volume has been the one with the most added pages in the history of Tensura light novels, even after attempts at cutting things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of Editor I-san giving up the struggle was really unforgettable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But! It turned out, in the end, there were a couple pages left. They told me to write an afterword of around five pages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I mentioned this before, when I go to a bookshop to read light novels, I would first read the blurb before checking the afterword. Sometimes I will even determine whether the work is interesting or not on the merits of the afterword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, even if the work is part of a big series, I&rsquo;ll still read the afterword to first check whether there is any new information, when the next volume will be released, etc. That&rsquo;s my habit of checking before reading the actual book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why personally I felt that &ldquo;the afterword is important,&rdquo; but when it came to my time to write one, it was a different story&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, actually, I suppose even if I were to write about the author&rsquo;s personal life, not a lot of people would be interested. And if I discussed something related to the series, it would become a spoiler. As opposed to writing an afterword, it&rsquo;s probably better to write more in the main story. That&rsquo;s probably what a lot of people&rsquo;s thoughts are right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If the readers want to hear about things like this in particular, please </span><span class="c4">contact</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;GC</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Novels editorial department!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will probably be reflected in the book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let&rsquo;s have a little chat about this time&rsquo;s volume.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regarding the pistol that was introduced in this volume, there&rsquo;s an untold story behind it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the first time I used Arabic numerals. That was the pistol name that actually exists in real life, &ldquo;Walther P99&rdquo;. We were going to use kanji for the numbers, but it seems that weapons from the real world are an exception to that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weapon that Glenda used in the novel was a semi-automatic pistol developed by the German weapon manufacturer Walther. And of course, it is real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, I was considering whether I should use a pistol produced by Beretta, such as the M92 or PX4, but if I did, it may get mixed up with the character Beretta. That&rsquo;s why I got pretty frustrated trying to decide which gun to choose, before finally settling on the P99.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Speaking of Walther, their P38 is quite famous. The highly popular master thief (Lupin III)</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;also uses this weapon, so it&rsquo;s very well known. I initially wanted to get some of his clout but decided not to in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glenda-san is a female, so a smaller and more compact weapon is probably more suited for her. Based on this consideration, I settled on the gun that was introduced this time, the &ldquo;Walther P99&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its name only appeared once, but in order to write about it, I researched a bunch and even bought an airsoft version of it. It was then that I recalled I wanted one when I was a kid. I suppose this can be considered as me fulfilling a childhood dream, now that I have the money as an adult&mdash;uh, but I digress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s the type of gun it was. I plan to make it show up a couple of times in the future as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are mechanical and magic type pistols. While the pistols in question have the same names, the two are very different from each other. For instance, the gun Rimuru brought to the exploration was only a recreated copy. It only looked similar in appearance. It also seemed to require gunpowder, but I felt that there was too much complication. Can&rsquo;t we make it a bit simpler? That&rsquo;s why I gave the final pistol some magic modification.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Furthermore, in the book I hinted at the fact that the Empire had guns as well. So, I plan to write something completely different for them. I only made the magic-modified guns with reference to the way that Rimuru and the others thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how I felt. But there are also other problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the demon side, I planned that for the same clan, they will be named after supercars. On the other hand, the series of magic dolls, like Beretta, would be named after gun manufacturers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the web novel, Beretta didn&rsquo;t have any brothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what should we do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason why we mentioned naming Walther was in hope that Rimuru would recall the matter&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sig, Colt, Glock, Mauser, Mateba, Remington. There are also the twins, Heckler and Koch. There are also tons of other candidates, but these are the only ones that made it in. These people, as Beretta&rsquo;s peers, will surely shine in the Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c8">Figuring out their backstories alone would be tiring, so please don&rsquo;t let them be introduced</span><span class="c1">&mdash;I could almost hear someone&rsquo;s cry along this line, so there&rsquo;s probably no need to introduce them. However, I hope that, in the future, they can be introduced in side stories and other Tensura IP.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And these are the untold stories about guns.</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c5 c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here at the end of the volume, I want to express my gratitude to everyone that I&rsquo;ve accumulated from my daily life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, I want to thank Editor I-san who was always helpful with providing information to me. With the increase in pages, I apologize for the extra work. But since you said that it was good for the readers, as the author, I was therefore relieved. My mood really improves whenever I&rsquo;m talking to you over the phone, so I&rsquo;ll be counting on you in the future as well!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s also </span><span class="c4">Mitz Vah-sensei</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who has provided the series with beautiful illustrations every time. Thank you for your hard work on designing Mariabell. Thanks to you, the character was created excellently. As I am writing this afterword, you must be working hard on Volume 10&rsquo;s cover and illustration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even as the author, I am also looking forward to it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The series only got to be published with the support of the proofreaders, designers, and other people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank you all so much!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would also like to thank all the readers. &ldquo;That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime&rdquo; managed to make it through the tenth volume at last. Thanks to all the readers for following the series to this day. To repay everyone&rsquo;s support, I will work harder in the future with the goal of concluding the series one day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Please continue to support &ldquo;That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime&rdquo;!</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px;"><img alt="" src="images/image20.png" style="width: 793.70px; height: 1127.06px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="FIN"></span></p><div><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></div><hr class="c17"><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;Ruby test: Kurasemi (Blue Dark Crowd)</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;Kanji: &#25505;&#21462;&#20418;, it&rsquo;s a general term that refers to people who are good at gathering items, I can only assume it&rsquo;s some very obscure game/novel reference because I can&rsquo;t seem to find any modern trpg reference of this.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;Kanji reads Magic Silver (analogous to Magisteel)</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;Ruby text: &#12456;&#12524;&#12513;&#12531;&#12479;&#12523;&#12467;&#12525;&#12483;&#12469;&#12473; &#32854;&#38666;&#12398;&#23432;&#35703;&#24040;&#20687; (Elemental Colossus)</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref5" id="ftnt5">[5]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;The term &ldquo;magicule&rdquo; may invoke the idea of a molecule, however, it actually refers to an element.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref6" id="ftnt6">[6]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;To clarify, the demonic element actually refers to magicule, because only monsters possess magicule (humans use mana), and the holy element is the counterpart to all monsters.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref7" id="ftnt7">[7]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;The ruby text was rather incomprehensible &#12462;&#12472;&#12467;&#12531; (Gigicon), which is why we went with the kanji</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref8" id="ftnt8">[8]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;The Kanji reads &lsquo;Magic Essence Core&rsquo;.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref9" id="ftnt9">[9]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;These are the result of combining the &lsquo;Master Core&rsquo; with an &lsquo;Emulated Soul&rsquo;.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref10" id="ftnt10">[10]</a><span class="c33">&nbsp;TL note: I believe Romantic Type (</span><span class="c25 c27">&#28010;&#28459;&#22411;) here has a similar meaning to phrase like &lsquo;</span><span class="c25 c29">&#12513;&#12459;&#12399;&#30007;&#12398;&#28010;&#28459;&rsquo; (Robots are men&rsquo;s romance), it is just an otaku thing to say when you really enjoy/are attracted to certain archetype or genre.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref11" id="ftnt11">[11]</a><span class="c20">&nbsp;The source here states &lsquo;&#12371;&#12428;&#12364;&#12289;&#12487;&#12524;&#12363;&rsquo;, which mean, &ldquo;Is this what they call &lsquo;dere&rsquo;&rdquo;.
