Against this backdrop, the image of a beautiful woman in </span><span class="c1">flight</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;stood out prominently on the monitor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;S-sister&hellip;&rdquo; Veldora thoughtl</span><span class="c1">essly </span><span class="c4 c1">muttered.

That is my sister Velgrynd, one of the supreme True Dragons&hellip;Scorch Dragon Velgrynd.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Upon hearing this, the remaining people in the Control Room </span><span class="c1">immediately</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;took action</span><span class="c1">, sounding </span><span class="c4 c1">the emergency alarms in the labyrinth</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;alerting everyone to the foreign presence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;W-wait, Master?! What can we do when Rimuru isn&rsquo;t even here?&rdquo; Ramiris panicked. Although she was normally a bit hel</span><span class="c1">pful</span><span class="c4 c1">, all she could do at a time like this was raise a ruckus. Research was one thing, but Ramiris had no place in a battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">However, Ramiris had a group of friends that she could</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;rely on&mdash;t</span><span class="c4 c1">here </span><span class="c1">were</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;the labyrinth managers, Treyni and her sisters, along with their subordinates, the dryads. She also had Beretta</span><span class="c4 c1">. Although no longer a part of the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten, he was still the Dungeon Master. However, the most dire </span><span class="c1">circumstance</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;was that half of the Elite Ten, who would normally spearhead the defense</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in a situation like this</span><span class="c4 c1">, were currently in a state of evolutionary slumber. Therefore, Beretta, as the former leader, had to do his best to protect Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c1">look friendly</span><span class="c4 c1">. We shall meet her inside the labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Treyni and the others had already assessed the situation at each level, and Beretta confirmed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Of the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten, only the Four Great Dragon Kings were still awake. Gadra was also awake, but absent, as he had taken the Demon Colossus and was on his way to reinforce the Armed Nation of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beretta&rsquo;s reasoning was that, a</span><span class="c4 c1">lthough they were not strong enough to fight against Velgrynd, even their </span><span class="c1">reduced </span><span class="c4 c1">force should be able to stall for time by using labyr</span><span class="c1">inth&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4 c1">perfect defenses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora nodded in response. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she is doing here, but it was foolish to come alone. With all of you here, so there is nothing to be afraid of! Kuahahaha!&rdquo; he laughed bullishly with a smile, yet his expression was tense. He was clearly afraid. Just a</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">day ag</span><span class="c1">o </span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora had been tossed around by his elder sister Velzard. The memory was still fresh in his mind, and now his younger sister Velgrynd </span><span class="c1">was </span><span class="c4 c1">single-handedly attacking</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">the central city of Rimuru, the capital of the Jura-Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora fou</span><span class="c1">nd the whole situation </span><span class="c4 c1">outrageous, and desperately wracked his brain, hoping to somehow find a way out. </span><span class="c1">So </span><span class="c4 c1">he immediately jumped at Beretta&rsquo;s suggestion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">But at that moment&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&lsaquo;Veldora, be a good boy and come out quietly.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s mouth moved on the monitor, and her voice echoed in his mind in the form of a thought. T</span><span class="c4 c1">o </span><span class="c1">Veldora, it felt as though her</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;gaze was fixed on him even through the monitor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Veldora-sama&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Charys, </span><span class="c1">this is not me being scared</span><span class="c4 c1">!

If it&rsquo;s Master she&rsquo;s after, then this has nothing to do with us&mdash;Mmph!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Ramiris, who flamboyantly tried to avoid the crisis, was unwillingly </span><span class="c1">cut off </span><span class="c4 c1">mid-sentence when</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora&rsquo;s hand </span><span class="c1">covered</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, </span><span class="c4 c1">everyone had to prepare to fight to the end&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I see, so you&rsquo;re not going to come out? You&rsquo;re just as stupid as you always were, aren&rsquo;t you? Fine. In that case, I&rsquo;ll just give you a gentle warning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">From the monitor, it was hard to tell what Velgrynd was saying. But everyone in the room understood that the mood had changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora heard her loud and clear, and he could tell that Velgrynd was planning something. But&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">No, it&rsquo;s okay. Ramiris built her labyrinth using superior power that can isolate even dimensions. Defeating it would be a difficult task even for me. No matter what she does, she can&rsquo;t touch me as long as I stay here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">That&rsquo;s right. As long as one was in the labyrinth, escaping from Velgrynd was possible. A level or two may be breached, but Ramiris&rsquo; restorative powers were greater than any dest</span><span class="c1">ructive force</span><span class="c4 c1">. With Veldora&rsquo;s help, it should not be impossible to keep Velgrynd at bay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;No need to fear. As long as you and I work together, no matter who the opponent is&mdash;&rdquo; Veldora tried to explain, but he didn</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;t get a chance </span><span class="c4 c1">to finish his sentence, as Velgrynd suddenly summoned a crimson spear in her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Ma-Master! This is bad. If we don&rsquo;t do something, even &lsquo;Labyrinth Creation&rsquo; might not be able to protect us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">That goes without saying</span><span class="c4 c1">&mdash;Veldora thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I know! Everybody, prepare for impact!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">No one needed a second warning. Everyone immediately took a defensive stance, and moments later a violent onslaught assaulted the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;N-no way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve confirmed that the damage has spread to the fiftieth floor&hellip;the upper floors have been destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Alpha and Beta kept reporting damage one after another. </span><span class="c1">At</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;that moment, the myth about the labyrinth&rsquo;s absolute safety completely collapsed. </span><span class="c1">J</span><span class="c4 c1">ust as Veldora was starting to let fear give way to full blown panic, he received a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; from Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&lsaquo;Hey&hellip; How are you?&rsaquo; R</span><span class="c1">imuru asked in a leisurely voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora replied indignantly, </span><span class="c4 c1">&lsaquo;Fool, this is not the time for that! We&rsquo;re in big trouble!! Sister&hellip;my sister is coming after me.

It&rsquo;s better than being attacked inside the labyrinth.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">I think I can do it</span><span class="c4 c1">&mdash;Veldora thought so without any basis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Despite his best attempts to block it out, he couldn</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;t forget </span><span class="c4 c1">Rimuru&rsquo;s demanding training regimen. </span><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c4 c1">f he could survive that kind of training, then he shouldn</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;t lose to anyone, not</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;even Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&lsaquo;I will take full responsibility, so I want you to take care of Velgrynd. Can I ask this of you?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Rimuru also did not seem to think that Veldora would lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">If Rimuru says he will take full responsibility, it means that he will not be angry no matter how much destruction Veldora causes. If Veldora took that into account, it was like being told to show off the fruits of his training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Now that Rimuru had asked this of him, there was only one answer to give.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&lsaquo;Oh? If that&rsquo;s the case, then just leave it to me! Kuahahahaha!!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">With that, Veldora turned his attention back to Velgrynd. The </span><span class="c1">chat </span><span class="c4 c1">with Rimuru had brought him back to his usual mindset. Veldora felt himself quickly calming down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I guess I have no choice but to deal with her myself,&rdquo; Veldora said in a relaxed manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Veldora-sama?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Ramiris and Beretta looked at Veldora in surprise. Veldora looked refreshed, as if all anxiety had been blown away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! I don&rsquo;t like the idea of fighting my sister, either. But if the labyrinth cannot be used to buy time, there&rsquo;s no other way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Charys. Immortality in the labyrinth is possible only because it is an isolated space. Now that it is known that it will not work in front of my sister, the only way to minimize the damage is for me to go out there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora would be indestructible as long as Rimuru was alive and well. The only way to avoid casualties was for Veldora to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;In that case, I will go with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t. Even though you have become stronger, you are still completely incomparable to me. Perhaps Zegion might be, but any others will only slow me down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">It was a harsh statement, but it was the truth. And Veldora</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;s mind was</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;made up. Veldora</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;put on a dignified expression that almost made his companions forget his shameful behavior to this point</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re okay with it, Master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Hell no! Just thinking about how my sister ha</span><span class="c1">s</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;treated me makes me shudder&hellip; </span><span class="c1">But </span><span class="c4 c1">never mind. I&rsquo;ve grown</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">stronger. Since meeting Rimuru, I have grown. I have taken on disciples and realized my past</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">immaturity. I am not who I used to be. Kuahahahahah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora forced a laugh, lifting the mood and returning him to his normal self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Don</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;t fret</span><span class="c4 c1">. Just watch me in all my glory!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">With that, he left the labyrinth alone.</span></p><p class="c15 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora recalled his past battle with Velzard. After such a long time, his older sister seemed to have grown much more powerful</span><span class="c1">&mdash;almost </span><span class="c4 c1">infallible</span><span class="c1">&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c1">compared to before. She now projected an aura that the old Veldora could not comprehend. </span><span class="c1">However</span><span class="c4 c1">, since he met Rimuru, Veldora, too, had grown to a completely new level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The </span><span class="c1">crowning </span><span class="c4 c1">achievement of his hard work was </span><span class="c1">his </span><span class="c4 c1">Ultimate Skill. While he was sealed away, he had observed Rimuru from inside the &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; and learned many things. And then, locked away in that dark void,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">he realized: power is meaningful only when mastered. Veldora had a huge amount of magicules, the largest amount of all the True Dragons. It was precisely because he possessed </span><span class="c1">more </span><span class="c4 c1">magicules than his two elder sisters that he was able to claim to be the strongest without much effort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">But he </span><span class="c1">realized his own naivete</span><span class="c4 c1">. He had learned that there were those who were weaker, but who never gave up on victory until the end. Rimuru was like that. </span><span class="c1">M</span><span class="c4 c1">any of his opponents were like that too</span><span class="c1">&mdash;s</span><span class="c4 c1">uch as Hinata, Granbell, and Demon Lord Luminas. They didn</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;t just rely </span><span class="c4 c1">on power </span><span class="c1">to achieve victory</span><span class="c4 c1">, but also on their </span><span class="c1">instinctual</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;drive to win by </span><span class="c1">any </span><span class="c4 c1">means necessary. Those are the people </span><span class="c1">against whom </span><span class="c4 c1">you can never let down </span><span class="c1">your </span><span class="c4 c1">guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This realization prompted a change in </span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">evidenced by the fact that even Velzard could no longer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">unilaterally</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;dominate him</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velzard was Veldora&rsquo;s natural enemy. In terms of power compatibility and nature, </span><span class="c1">she </span><span class="c4 c1">was a very bad match up. Velzard, who was the eldest of the three siblings, had a maximum power he couldn&rsquo;t even fathom. Despite his higher magicule count, he could barely cope when fighting against her</span><span class="c1">. It was as though his magicule count provided </span><span class="c4 c1">no advantage at all. Even if he fought </span><span class="c1">to the best of his ability</span><span class="c4 c1">, he could not hope for victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora had tried to fight Velzard several times since he was born, but </span><span class="c1">he was </span><span class="c4 c1">beaten back every time. Velzard&rsquo;s &lsquo;Eternal World&rsquo; was an ironclad defense and a weapon that sealed off Veldora&rsquo;s movements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Storm, Destruction, Corrosion, Annihilation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">All of these effects had no effect in the face of an </span><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">absolute stop</span><span class="c4 c1">. Veldora himself was surprised that he had even been able to take on such a fearsome sister.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">Way to go, </span><span class="c1 c2">me</span><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">He psyched </span><span class="c1">himself up</span><span class="c4 c1">. After all, he noticed that his sister Velzard was able to perfectly suppress her mana release, only because Veldora himself was able to control his own mana. The difference in </span><span class="c1">p</span><span class="c4 c1">roficiency between them was too great to compare. One reason may be that Velzard&rsquo;s power was specialized in stopping kinetic energy, but even so, there was no doubt that there was a huge difference in their abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velzard was a supreme talent, so Veldora was surprised to hear her praise </span><span class="c1">his </span><span class="c4 c1">progress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c2 c5 c14">Well, I&rsquo;m surprised. The Veldora-chan who used to do nothing but rampage is actually able to think and fight. At this rate, I might not have to destroy you anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The </span><span class="c1">subtext was disturbing, no doubt, </span><span class="c4 c1">but over</span><span class="c1">all it was an </span><span class="c4 c1">unmistakabl</span><span class="c1">e</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;compliment. Tho</span><span class="c1">ugh still terrified, </span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora found himself a little less so after hearing his sister</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4 c1">compliment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">T</span><span class="c4 c1">hat said, he still couldn</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c4 c1">t </span><span class="c1">beat </span><span class="c4 c1">her&hellip;</span></p><p class="c15 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">So, what about Velgrynd?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velzard and Velgrynd were almost evenly matched. Neither of them had been good sisters to Veldora, and he really did not want to deal with them if he could avoid it. Of course, this time </span><span class="c1">he </span><span class="c4 c1">had no choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Sister Velgrynd</span><span class="c1">, you are </span><span class="c4 c1">as fierce as ever. Even I can&rsquo;t easily pierce through the levels of the labyrinth like that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">He could probably </span><span class="c1">destroy</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;one or two levels by force if he distort</span><span class="c1">ed</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;the </span><span class="c1">l</span><span class="c4 c1">abyrinth</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;s isolated</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;dimension. However, he definitely could not penetrate multiple layers at once, even when cranking out </span><span class="c1">as many </span><span class="c4 c1">magicules as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;This fight will turn on how we each use our Ultimate Skill</span><span class="c1">&mdash;i</span><span class="c4 c1">f I want to fight my sister properly, I will have to make skillful use of</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">&lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Yes. If one compared only the amount of magicules, Veldora was superior to Velgrynd. So this was still a little better than having to deal with Velzard, Veldora assured himself in order to mollify his mental trauma. </span><span class="c1">V</span><span class="c4 c1">ictory and defeat will de</span><span class="c1">finitely hinge on </span><span class="c4 c1">how well he used his power. Though neither of them had ever gone </span><span class="c1">all out when they </span><span class="c4 c1">fought in the past, Velgrynd had the edge in skill in each of those confrontations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">But that was a long time ago. Velzard was difficult to beat because of her natural affinity, but that was not the case with Velgrynd. And now, thanks to Rimuru, Veldora </span><span class="c1">has his own </span><span class="c4 c1">Ultimate Skill,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">&lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If t</span><span class="c4 c1">his power worked against Velzard, </span><span class="c1">then </span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora felt that he had nothing to fear, even </span><span class="c1">against </span><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd. That thought </span><span class="c1">motivated </span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">Kuahahahahaha!

You have my answer, Sister. I am not the same person I used to be. I h</span><span class="c1">ave already mastered </span><span class="c4 c1">my power. And it&rsquo;s no longer fun for me to aimlessly rampage. I&rsquo;m a grown-up now! A mature adult!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c4 c1">heeky. Did I spoil you too much? Fine. In that case, let me see just how much you&rsquo;ve grown up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora&rsquo;s slight provocation </span><span class="c4 c1">was all it took to get Velgrynd going</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Seeing this, Veldora shift</span><span class="c1">ed</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;into a fighting stance. </span><span class="c1">It never crossed </span><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;s mind that </span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora </span><span class="c1">might</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;obey her orders after a few kind words. She understood that with her brother, she had to </span><span class="c1">d</span><span class="c4 c1">emonstrate her strength and make him obey. If that didn&rsquo;t work, she would simply ask Rudra to take control of him once he was weakened. </span><span class="c1">She had made the offer only out of the </span><span class="c4 c1">goodness of her he</span><span class="c1">art</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd, feeling mildly annoyed at her brother</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;s obstinance</span><span class="c4 c1">, s</span><span class="c1">wiftly </span><span class="c4 c1">unleashed a thrust at Veldora. She intended to quickly weaken Veldora and wait for Rudra to arrive. However, the blade on her right hand was easily deflected by Veldora. Not only that, but he immediately answere</span><span class="c1">d back </span><span class="c4 c1">with a kick. Velgrynd, while frustrated, caught the kick with her left hand, but&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">How?! This kind of power, no matter how you think about it, is not from someone in a weakened state!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd still believed that Veldora had not fully recovered from the damage he had sustained while sealed for the past 300 years. This assumption ste</span><span class="c1">mmed from the fact that </span><span class="c4 c1">the Veldora she had known always used his power at the max right from the off. Now, after this opening exchange, she realized that she was wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Have you improved your skills a bit? Looks like you have something to brag about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;My Veldora Style Killing Arts&trade; are undefeatable! Even you, Sister, will know your own powerlessness before these fists&mdash;W-wa-wait&mdash;Huah?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Veldora was about to make his smug speech, but Velgrynd </span><span class="c1">didn&rsquo;t intend </span><span class="c4 c1">to listen quietly. In fact, she was annoyed, so she launched </span><span class="c1">a series of </span><span class="c4 c1">violent attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Red lotus flames dwelled in both of Velgrynd&rsquo;s fists as well as in the supple legs that extended from the hem of her dress. The graceful succession of dance-like moves was so full of fury that </span><span class="c1">a grazing hit </span><span class="c4 c1">could burn an enemy to death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Nevertheless, Veldora held his ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Aaah hot, h-h-hot!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Even though Veldora </span><span class="c1">looked </span><span class="c4 c1">pathetic running around, he had not suffered much damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I disciplined you so much in the past, but it seems that you still haven&rsquo;t improved your sorry wits. You shouldn&rsquo;t talk so big, boasting about being invincible and undefeated right in front of me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Despite the burning intensity of her fury, Velgrynd remained calm. She saw that Veldora had not only fully recovered, but was also stronger than expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">This is troublesome. In this form, I can&rsquo;t take him on seriously nor do much damage. If this continues even Rudra </span><span class="c1 c2">won&rsquo;t be able </span><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">to control him&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s original intent was not to teach Veldora a lesson, but to control him. Once Rudra won the match against Guy, she would release him properly. But for now, she hoped that he could serve as an important pawn. Thus, for Velgrynd, there was no point in a small fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">And then there was Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Gwah?! My clothes&hellip; My clothes that Rimuru gave to me are now on fire because of you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The clothes that Veldora was currently wearing had been a gift from Rimuru as a token of appreciation. That precious gift had been burned by Velgrynd&rsquo;s attack. Over time, </span><span class="c1">as Veldora&rsquo;s aura seeped into the clothes, </span><span class="c4 c1">they would have become a part of his body. However, such a change doesn</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;t happen </span><span class="c4 c1">in just a few days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although </span><span class="c4 c1">Veldora had not suffered much damage, his heart was aching. </span><span class="c1">Ignoring the fact that he had chosen to wear his new clothes into battle, </span><span class="c4 c1">he focused on </span><span class="c1">taking it </span><span class="c4 c1">out on his sister. And, as it turned out, that was a lucky turn for Veldora. His anger masked his fear. No matter how much he </span><span class="c1">steeled his resolve, his two sisters had been symbols of terror to him for years, and that fear was deeply </span><span class="c4 c1">ingrained in his psyche</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c4 c1">In that state</span><span class="c1">, he really couldn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c4 c1">go all out if </span><span class="c1">one of them was </span><span class="c4 c1">the opponent. But now, those shackles </span><span class="c1">were broken</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Even if you are my sister, I cannot forgive this. Prepare to feel my wrath!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">With a mighty shout, Veldora unleashed his power. A mighty and majestic jet-black dragon emerged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Seeing this, Velgrynd snickered at the convenience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Huh? </span><span class="c1">A</span><span class="c4 c1">re you too stupid to know what you&rsquo;re talking about</span><span class="c1">? </span><span class="c4 c1">You seem to have forgotten the fundamental fact that you</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;re no match for me</span><span class="c4 c1">, so I&rsquo;ll have to re-educate you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">With that, Velgrynd transformed as well. She transformed into a supple, beautiful crimson dragon.</span></p><p class="c15 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So commenced </span><span class="c4 c1">the great battle of True Dragons.</span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c4 c1"><br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0" id="h.3znysh7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c30" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c32 c14 c22 c17">Chapter 1</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c13 c21">Time of Despair</span><a id="id.tyjcwt"></a></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c1">Just as Rimuru was preparing to infiltrate the Imperial City, Dwarf King Gazel Dwargo found himself at the center of a desperate battlefield. He was unable to avert his </span><span class="c1">gaze</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;from the incarnation of beauty scatter</span><span class="c1">ing</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;death in the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Was that &lsquo;Gravity Collapse&rsquo;? It can theoretically expand its power </span><span class="c1">infinitely</span><span class="c4 c1">. Do you think legion magic can prevent it?&rdquo; Gazel </span><span class="c1">asked</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;th</span><span class="c1">e assembled group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd. It&rsquo;s impossible to prevent it, even if you place both the magic support team and the magic strike team on the defense. </span><span class="c1">A </span><span class="c4 c1">True Dragon is not a danger that can be quantified</span><span class="c1">,</span><span class="c4 c1">&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">answered Admiral Paladin Vaughn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Vaughn, along with the dwarf army deployed to </span><span class="c1">the area, </span><span class="c4 c1">had been waiting for Gazel&rsquo;s arrival. As such, he had a front row seat to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">the destruction of the Empire&rsquo;s Mixed Corps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">All the soldiers were shocked speechless by the scale of the tragedy. Their will to fight </span><span class="c1">was </span><span class="c4 c1">crushed, yet they did not </span><span class="c1">flee</span><span class="c4 c1">. Everyone understood that retreat here meant the death of their family and friends back home. If their death could help those precious loved ones survive for even a little while longer, that alone </span><span class="c1">justified</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;their sacrifice. That thought kep</span><span class="c1">t their feet planted in their orderly </span><span class="c4 c1">ranks. King Gazel, a champion, would not </span><span class="c1">squander </span><span class="c4 c1">their lives in vain. That is what the soldiers believed, and from that belief sprang their deep loyalty to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Gazel fully understood and accepted </span><span class="c4 c1">the feelings of the soldiers, Gazel was in agony. Although he remained calm on the surface, his mind was in turmoil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">We can&rsquo;t win, and this futile battle will end up wasting everyone&rsquo;s lives. Should I surrender? </span><span class="c1 c2">T</span><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">he Empire will not allow it. We must show them at least some of our power&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">They had to convince the </span><span class="c1">E</span><span class="c4 c1">mpire that </span><span class="c1">it was better to take them in than to fight them. Otherwise</span><span class="c4 c1">, the Empire would not even accept their submission. In that case, the only way to survive was to fight them tooth and nail. No matter how many sacrifices had to be made, they had to believe that they would not die in vain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;They say quality is better than quantity, but this feels like cheating. We&rsquo;ll have to take her on all by ourselves and defeat her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Hey now, </span><span class="c1">isn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;the king supposed to command the whole army?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Fool, there is only one enemy. Under the circumstances, what use is there</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in commanding the whole army</span><span class="c4 c1">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Gazel laughed at Vaughn&rsquo;s question. There was only one enemy&mdash;Velgrynd. Strategy and tactics were meaningless against her, and Gazel and the others had no choice but to find a way to survive. Vaughn, well aware of this, asked his question facetiously to ease Gazel&rsquo;s mind. And it helped, as Gazel felt his anxi</span><span class="c1">ety diminish</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Anrietta then reported to Gazel, &ldquo;My king, it seems that the Scorch Dragon is not the only enemy. There are a number of people behind her, and they seem to be performing some sort of ritual. Jaine-sama says that the supreme magic may be part of that ritual&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Gazel nodded in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The supreme magic that had sacrificed sixty thousand troops was being used in some kind of ritual. </span><span class="c1">Gazel could tell straight away that </span><span class="c4 c1">there was an evil plot afoot, the details of which he didn</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c4 c1">t wish to imagine. Even so, it would be extremely difficult to defeat Velgrynd, who was at the center of the plot. In that case, the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">only path forward was to defeat those behind her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Do you want to move the troops?&rdquo; Dolph asked, but Gazel shook his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The heavily-armed strike force was not very mobile and would become a target for magic if they were not moved </span><span class="c1">thoughtfully</span><span class="c4 c1">. Normally, they would use their strong defenses as a shield to push forward, but that would be pointless against Velgrynd. </span><span class="c1">A</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;suicide attack with five hundred Pegasus Knights would be their only option&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of weakening the defense here. Gazel&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ll just have to go in alone. Right, Dolph?&rdquo; Vaughn spoke with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Dolph, on the other hand, scratched his head and responded earnestly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s disrespectful, Vaughn. It&rsquo;s beyond outrageous to call the king by his name! You need to consider your position&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph lectured for a moment before </span><span class="c4 c1">agreeing with a smile, as if he had suddenly set asi</span><span class="c1">de his gripe</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;But this time, you&rsquo;ve got a point. If we want to buy as much time as possible, we should avoid dispersing our forces. Besides, if it&rsquo;s just us, we&rsquo;ll be agile and might be able to take the enemy by surprise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Jaine-sama also said she would join the war once she has persuaded the elders,&rdquo; Anrietta added in agreement. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just leave all those worries to her, and we can go wild like in the old </span><span class="c1">days</span><span class="c4 c1">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">They waited for Gazel&rsquo;s reply with bated breath. These old friends had not changed at all. They were united with Gazel and stood by him to help him tackle this </span><span class="c1">impossible </span><span class="c4 c1">situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Gazel laughed, &ldquo;Fufu! What a bunch of fools! I wonder what Jaine, our chaperone, would say if she heard&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">For a long time, Jaine had been accompanying Gazel and his crew, giving them candid advice and suggestions. She was the most powerful wizard in the Dwarven Kingdom, and Gazel&rsquo;s trusted advisor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">Jaine would be very angry, I suppose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">With that in mind, Gazel was about to make his decision. But it seemed to be a little too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Oh dear. This is what happens when I take my eyes off of you for even a second. </span><span class="c1">Y</span><span class="c4 c1">ou&rsquo;re such a trouble-maker, King Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Just before Gazel and the others set out, Jaine arrived via transfer magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Jaine. Did you hear everything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Jaine stole a sideways glance at </span><span class="c1">an </span><span class="c4 c1">embarrassed-looking Gazel and shook her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I thought that you had become a magnificent king and was relieved. However, I can&rsquo;t blame you this time. With an opponent like her, there is nothing we can do. The reason that a True Dragon is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;C</span><span class="c4 c1">atastrophe</span><span class="c1">-</span><span class="c4 c1">class is because it is impossible for a nation to deal with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The True Dragons could not be touched by the kind of magic humans normally used. In fact, the spell that Velgrynd was currently wielding was far too powerful for human beings to manage. Even if all the champions of the human race were to unite, it was unknown whether or not they would be able to defeat a True Dragon. But that did not mean that there was no hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I just received notice</span><span class="c1">,</span><span class="c4 c1">&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Jaine said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;His Majesty Rimuru is sending reinforcements. Let&rsquo;s take action once they arrive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there was hope, right on time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;How is that possible? </span><span class="c1">Barely any time has </span><span class="c4 c1">passed since I contacted you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m having a hard time understanding it myself, but I&rsquo;m not lying. Vesta-dono reported to me, and we all know that </span><span class="c1">His Majesty </span><span class="c4 c1">Rimuru can mobilize all the people of that country with just a word&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">All </span><span class="c1">those </span><span class="c4 c1">gathered could only nod their heads in exasperation</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">as they listened to Jaine&rsquo;s dumbfounding words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">That&rsquo;s right, everyone understood right away. And before they could even change gears, reliable reinforcements had arrived.</span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

As if enveloped in a giant cocoon, a small army of elite soldiers emerged. There were one hundred of the Hiryuu led by Gabil, and three hundred of the Kurenai under the command of Gobua. Four hundred in total</span><span class="c1">&mdash;e</span><span class="c4 c1">ach at least A rank&mdash;a fighting group that could rival the Pegasus Knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">And what&rsquo;s more, there was a huge weapon that </span><span class="c1">demanded </span><span class="c4 c1">everyone&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I had heard that it was perfected, but I did not expect them to pull out all the stops and use it here. That&rsquo;s Rimuru for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Is that the finished form of the magic armored soldier?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It seems that it was named the &lsquo;Demon Colossus.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a reliable ally to have on your side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Gazel certainly understood that it would be no match for Velgrynd, however, its majestic appearance could put the soldiers at ease by its presence alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;How reliable. If we could have mass-produced them, we might have been able to fight a little better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Unfortunately, they would be useless against Velgrynd. It might be able to handle a Disaster-class, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">As Gazel and the others were having their conversation, some newcomers approached them. It was Gabil, the legion leader, and the three demon girls, led by Testarossa. They were followed by Gobua and Hakurou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;It has been a long time, King Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">For some reason, it was Testarossa who greeted them instead of Gabil. She was the right person for this situation. Testarossa had diplomatic authority, so she possessed a lot of experience and was used to these kinds of situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Long time no see, Testarossa-dono. Thank you for the reinforcements.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Under different circumstances, there would&rsquo;ve been things to take issue with in Gazel&rsquo;s reply. Formalities and etiquette were to be considered, and it would have been more normal to have a spokesman answer instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">However, this was not the time to be talking about such things. Everyone understood this and decided to ignore the formalities and hold a strategy meeting.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">They moved to the command post and everyone got down to business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa, on behalf of Rimuru and the others, informed them of the plan. She then proposed the strategy that should be carried out in this area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Hmm. Rimuru striking the emperor directly, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more realistic than a suicide mission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Is that so? It sounds like an absurd plan in and of itself&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Gazel snorted as if in deep thought. Vaughn agreed that the situation had improved. Dolph agonized over whether there was anything else they could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">There was no time to think about it. Since no one could come up with an alternative, Testarossa pushed the discussion forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;We will take care of Velgrynd-sama. The rest of you should work to stop the ritual taking place in the back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I have no objection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Gazel agreed to the unsolicited offer. With the absence of any alternative options, the demon girls were the only ones who could be trusted with the most dangerous task. It was Jaine who put the breaks on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;One moment. Testarossa-dono, can you, the Primordials, defeat the Scorch Dragon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">This was an important question that would affect the entire operation. </span><span class="c1">Velgrynd was so overwhelming that </span><span class="c4 c1">Jaine was convinced that Testarossa and her team could not win. There is no doubt that the three Primordials were their strongest force, but that made it all the more important to understand their odds of success. If Testarossa and the others were defeated here, the fate of everyone else would be sealed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think we can win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;In that case</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;y</span><span class="c4 c1">ou should stay on the defensive! Instead of provoking her rashly, why don&rsquo;t we wait here for His Majesty Rimuru&rsquo;s plan to succeed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With </span><span class="c4 c1">the odds against them, they should stall for time. Jaine&rsquo;s lo</span><span class="c1">gic seemed </span><span class="c4 c1">sound, but Rimuru&rsquo;s forces rejected it outright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Unfortunately, we cannot do that. If we leave Velgrynd-sama alone, she may return to the Imperial City to interfere with His Lordship.&rdquo; Carrera spoke firmly with determination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Although Rimuru had told them that they could leave Velgrynd alone, she had decided that they needed to draw her attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;More importantly, we did not come here to discuss a battle plan. We received an order from Rimuru-sama, and only came to tell you about it. I will consult with you if I can help, but I want you to know that I will not allow you to stand in our way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Even the usually </span><span class="c1">soft spoken </span><span class="c4 c1">Hakurou</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;harshly </span><span class="c4 c1">expressed his disagreement. Time was short, so he valued clear intentions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;over </span><span class="c4 c1">etiquette.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Gazel got the message. He spoke quickly </span><span class="c1">before </span><span class="c4 c1">his agitated companions could further object.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;If Hakurou-dono, my master, has said so, then I have no choice but to move aside. Otherwise, do you guys have a better idea?&rdquo; Gazel asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">H</span><span class="c4 c1">is companions could only solemn</span><span class="c1">ly</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;shake their heads.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;It will not be easy to interfere with the ritual with the Imperial Intelligence Bureau on the move. I think it is best to keep grounded here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Dolph&rsquo;s statement was definitive. All that remained was to confirm the details before the operation </span><span class="c1">commenced</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The three demonesses were fully aware of this, but they still did not hesitate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Can we interfere with the ritual by dealing with her?&rdquo; Ultima asked aloud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but even I would find it impossible to keep &lsquo;Gravity Collapse&rsquo; running </span><span class="c1">at that output</span><span class="c4 c1">,&rdquo; Carrera added. &ldquo;And for her to maintain the </span><span class="c1">magic </span><span class="c4 c1">and take on the three of us </span><span class="c1">at the same time</span><span class="c4 c1">, absolutely impossible, </span><span class="c1">right</span><span class="c4 c1">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I believe she can pull it off, which is why I am rather wary,&rdquo; Testarossa muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite serious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Oh well. No need to argue,&rdquo; Carrera exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Unperturbed, the three </span><span class="c1">conversed freely</span><span class="c4 c1">. Then, without hiding, they walked straight towards Velgrynd in a dignified manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Naturally, Velgrynd was aware of them. However, she was not wary, but rather happily allowed the three demons to approach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Good day to you. It is a good day for a fight, is it not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa greeted, and Velgrynd responded with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Yes, it is. But before we fight, let me ask you something. Why don&rsquo;t you join my side? You are Primordials of great strength. I promise to treat you well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Before the three demons, Velgrynd kept her relaxed demeanor and made her offer. Needless to say, Testarossa and the others answered with a resounding no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I have history with the Empire, so allow me to reject that offer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Same for me. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve had a master, and it&rsquo;s surprisingly comfortable. I don&rsquo;t want to give it up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;As she said. More importantly, let&rsquo;s just end this conversation and get on with the fight. If you don&rsquo;t want to go one-on-three, you can call in the men behind you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">A clear rejection that </span><span class="c1">left</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;no room for negotiation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Carrera, for her part, did not care about negotiating, and was in high spirits as she prepared for battle. Seeing Velgrynd&rsquo;s magic so close to her, her fighting instincts were </span><span class="c1">on fire</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd laughed. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your answer. Okay then. In that case, I&rsquo;ll play with you guys for a bit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">That was the signal for the battle to begin.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">And then, slowly, right in front of Testarossa and the others, Velgrynd split. No&hellip; Like a reflection in the mirror, the number of Velgrynds increased to two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa had an idea of what the phenomenon was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;How troublesome. This isn&rsquo;t just a &lsquo;Clone.&rsquo; If I had to say, this seems to be like Raine&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mist</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;.</span><span class="c4 c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa had fought Raine in the past. She forgot the cause of the </span><span class="c1">dispute, </span><span class="c4 c1">but she had accumulated a lot of combat experience from the </span><span class="c1">exchange</span><span class="c4 c1">. Raine&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mist&rsquo; was a Skill that allowed her to generate a clone by splitting her body in half. However, unlike &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;, only one of the two could carry consciousness. Even so, depending on how it was used, it could be vicious, and was perfect for catching an enemy off guard. Although it was difficult to use against cautious opponents, it was an ability </span><span class="c1">with strong</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">safety</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;insurance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">However, considering that Velgrynd&rsquo;s Parallel Existence could create &lsquo;Split Bodies,&rsquo; it could not be denied that it was superior in all respects. </span><span class="c1">The difference between the two Skills was like heaven and earth</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa did not know this, but a shadow began showing on her beautiful face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Raine, you see, can </span><span class="c1">split </span><span class="c4 c1">her body and &lsquo;regenerate&rsquo; from any one piece of flesh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I see. That means either one can be considered the main body, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;That is the case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa and the others analyzed the situation without rushing. Even though the battle had already begun, their attitude was just as unharried as when they were elegantly speaking </span><span class="c1">a moment ago</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Blanc is very clever, and yes, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Velgrynd said, amused. &ldquo;This is one of my powers, called &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t want you to interfere with the ritual, so I&rsquo;ll deal with you here,&rdquo; she declared while gracefully waving her fan.</span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image21.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><a id="id.3dy6vkm"></a></p><a id="id.3dy6vkm1"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa wasn&rsquo;t amused by that statement. The corners of her eyes were glinting as she glared at Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I now have the name &lsquo;Testarossa&rsquo; given to me by my lord, Rimuru-sama. I wish you would stop calling me Blanc.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">As she said this, Testarossa casually twirled a flaming whip she had created out of nowhere. The whip twisted around like a snake as it attacked Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I heard about that. So it&rsquo;s true that the slime has been naming Primordials.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">With that bit of intel now confirmed, Velgrynd couldn&rsquo;t hide her surprise. However, her body remained undisturbed as she flicked away Testarossa&rsquo;s whip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rude to call His Lordship a slime,&rdquo; Carrera roared indignantly and unleashed her magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">She opened with her trump card, &lsquo;Gravity Collapse,&rsquo; right out of the gate. The scale was reduced in size as much as possible, thus increasing the </span><span class="c1">intensity</span><span class="c4 c1">. The strongest attack that Carrera could currently muster hit Velgrynd, who was focused on Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd was enveloped in a jet-black pillar that seemed to connect heaven and earth. The circular pillar, which was only big</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;enough to </span><span class="c4 c1">hold a single person, was like a prison from which there was no escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd smiled fearlessly, remaining unperturbed in the cage of hypergravity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;As expected of a demon overlord. Your magic is perfectly powerful. However, for so long as you are bound by the laws of this world your attack</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">won&rsquo;t work against a True Dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">As if to prove her point, Velgrynd shattered the jet-black pillar from within. She raised her own mana and interfered with Carrera&rsquo;s magic, rendering it powerless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Hahaha! As expected of Veldora-sama&rsquo;s sister, you&rsquo;re making it seem like a joke. If magic doesn&rsquo;t work, then there&rsquo;s nothing more I can do, huh? No! I have a sword technique I&rsquo;m learning from Agera. It may be useless, but I&rsquo;ll give it a try!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Carrera seemed to be enjoying herself, even though her best move had just been defeated. Without any sign of distress, she raised the sword she had created with magic. The beautiful sword had a fierce presence that was unbecoming of a demon. Carrera&rsquo;s magical energy flowed directly into the blade, giving it a radiant glow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;This is most likely our only </span><span class="c1">choice</span><span class="c4 c1">. It is not simple magic nor Skill, but a technique you have developed and improved yourself. It may work even against the True Dragons, the source of the world. Veldora-sama says that a woman named Hinata has proven this approach effective.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Without needing to test it, Testarossa knew that magic would not work on Velgrynd. That was why she had materialized a whip using magic from the very start. The whip was white&mdash;a magic formula devised by Testarossa, possessing a contradictory nature known as &ldquo;freezing white flame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Hmm, humans are interesting after all. Maybe I&rsquo;ll use this too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Saying this, Ultima materialized two knives and held them in her hands. The blades of the knives were a poisonous purple color and had a sinister aura around them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Ult, you&rsquo;re already getting serious from the start. Aren&rsquo;t those the same ones that wounded Zegion last time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Well. Honestly, I thought it was pointless for us to move our bodies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a surprise? I never thought my experience fighting Zegion-dono would come in so handy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The girls were good at magic, and never really put much emphasis on close combat. However, in their battle against Zegion, all other means of attack had been ineffective. The reason for this was Zegion&rsquo;s ironclad defense as well as his absolute superiority over magic. Almost all magic was ineffective against Zegion. As a result, they had been forced to seek other means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">And the answer they came up with was this. They had finally succeeded in damaging Zegion with a </span><span class="c1">blow infused with a strong force of will</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;into which they poured their whole existence as a spiritual life form. For a spiritual life form, the power of the will triumphed over anyone. A Skill was just another form of will force created by the desire of each individual, and the ultimate culmination of that was the Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">If that was the case, how close could their wills get to it? They concluded that they would just have to test it. By materializing their will, they created weapons that each of them was good at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Zegion&rsquo;s defense was not inferior to an Ultimate Skill. Nevertheless, Ultima&rsquo;s knives had inflicted wounds on Zegion&rsquo;s body. In other words, the attacks of the three demon girls could reach the Ultimate Skill level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I tried to imitate Ult&rsquo;s weapon. My swordsmanship was just for fun, but Agera ha</span><span class="c1">s taught me the intricacies of swordsmanship</span><span class="c4 c1">. Let</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;me be your opponent</span><span class="c4 c1">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">As soon as she said that, Carrera sprinted forward. Without any thought of defense, she slashed at Velgrynd with all her might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd parried the slash with her feather fan. It was made of high-grade feathers and could hardly be called a weapon. However, its strength had been altered by Velgrynd&rsquo;s demonic </span><span class="c1">aura</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;and was harder than a diamond. It was thin, light, flexible, and hard. It was not at all inferior to Carrera&rsquo;s sword and was Velgrynd&rsquo;s favorite weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised that you Primordials are so quick to dismiss magic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Is it that surprising</span><span class="c4 c1">? </span><span class="c1">What is our pride but a pittance in comparison to the victory we shall bring to our Lord?</span><span class="c4 c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s whip struck Velgrynd, who had turned to the defensive in the face of Carrera&rsquo;s onslaught. Like a white snake that had split into countless pieces, Testarossa hunted down her prey at will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Tsk!&rdquo; Velgrynd clicked her tongue in annoyance. The hem of her dress was torn by the whip. A glimpse of her beautiful legs peeked out, and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a bright red welt</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;could be clearly seen there. It was proof that Testarossa&rsquo;s attack had worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Nice work, Testa. I&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">ll continue being the </span><span class="c4 c1">vanguard, so keep up the good work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re happy at such a fluke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Even though she was slightly injured, Velgrynd was still relaxed and had plenty of time. That&rsquo;s why, while facing Testarossa and the others, she made a serious blunder. In other words, she had been careless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a fluke, was it?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Ultima&rsquo;s triumphant voice sounded just as Velgrynd felt a pain in her side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&mdash;</span><span class="c1 c14 c2 c5">What?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">A moment of confusion. As if aiming for that moment, Testarossa&rsquo;s whip and Carrera&rsquo;s sword strikes came one after the other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd fell to her knee. She could not immediately understand what had happened to her. No, it wasn&rsquo;t that she couldn&rsquo;t. Rather she didn&rsquo;t want to understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">That was a clean hit</span><span class="c4 c1">, Ultima. </span><span class="c1">We shall</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;ask Rimuru-sama for praise later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">That was</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;impressive, but we must not be careless. Let&rsquo;s keep this thing going!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Yeah! There</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;s still another </span><span class="c4 c1">&lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; left, so let&rsquo;s kill th</span><span class="c1">at one</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;too and interrupt the ritual!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Hearing these voices in the distance, Velgrynd stood up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Oh my, </span><span class="c1">it seems</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;you didn&rsquo;t take too much damage from our attacks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Even I would take a long time to break the hold of Ult&rsquo;s &lsquo;poison curse.&rsquo;</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;True Dragons </span><span class="c1">are</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;really </span><span class="c1">amazing</span><span class="c4 c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;But</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you see, it&rsquo;s not like we can&rsquo;t beat her, right</span><span class="c4 c1">? The damage will accumulate</span><span class="c1">;</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;at this rate, </span><span class="c1">she&rsquo;ll&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd moved fast</span><span class="c1">, outpacing</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Ultima before she could finish her sentence. She grabbed Ultima by the neck and slammed her to the ground with such speed that even the three demon girls&rsquo; super intuition could not detect her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Guha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd kicked Ultima, who groaned involuntarily, and Velgrynd left the scene. Immediately after, Carrera&rsquo;s slash passed through the space where Velgrynd had been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd, now out of Carrera&rsquo;s range, pulled a knife </span><span class="c1">stabbed in</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;her side and threw it away. Her clothes were still torn, but there were no scars on her white skin. It was as if the damage caused by the barrage of attacks was nothing to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;You really are a monster, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd responded to Carrera&rsquo;s mumbling with a slight </span><span class="c1">self-mockery</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;Not really. I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;still have a long way to go</span><span class="c4 c1">. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve been careless enough to get hurt. No.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I could have been doing it habitually, but I just was not aware of it, since it never resulted in issues</span><span class="c4 c1">. It&rsquo;s like the fate of being the strongest, but you guys can understand that too, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd chuckled, but her eyes were sharp. She glared at Testarossa and the others, ready to </span><span class="c1">notice </span><span class="c4 c1">the slightest movements. There was no hope for her to be caught off guard a second time, and thus, at this moment, Testarossa and the girls&rsquo; chances of victory were reduced to zero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;The Primordials really are </span><span class="c1">troublesome</span><span class="c4 c1">, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are a threat. It just means that they are a pain to deal with. However, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. Now that you&rsquo;ve incarnated and been given names, you&rsquo;ve become stronger than I ever imagined. I will acknowledge that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd </span><span class="c1">was not underestimating the </span><span class="c4 c1">primordial demons. Even if their strength was not as great as hers, she could still benefit from their help. They could be of great help to Velgrynd when she challenged her sister, Velzard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">In fact, Velgrynd had been taken by surprise just now. If this had happened during a battle with her sister, Velgrynd&rsquo;s defeat would have been decisive. As proof of this, Testarossa and the others&rsquo; attack had succeeded in ruining Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;. Of course, she would recover in time. However, as Carrera had said, it was a painstaking task for Velgrynd to break Ultima&rsquo;s poison </span><span class="c1">curse</span><span class="c4 c1">. So Velgrynd released the damaged &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; and created a new </span><span class="c1">one</span><span class="c4 c1">. In this way, she made all her damage disappear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Such usage was the essence of &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;. No matter how </span><span class="c1">powerful the killer move</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;was, it was meaningless in the face of Velgrynd&rsquo;s power. However, this Skill was not all-powerful either. There were some restrictions on its use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The biggest restriction was that for every &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; created, 10 percent of the maximum amount of magicules would be used as collateral. This was not a consumption, but a maintenance cost. </span><span class="c1">The term &lsquo;collateral&rsquo; was employed </span><span class="c4 c1">since </span><span class="c1">she</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;would get </span><span class="c1">the magicules</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;back </span><span class="c1">once</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;the &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; was erased. However, it was also an irrefutable fact that there was a limit to the number of &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; that could be created. The maximum number of &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; that Velgrynd could </span><span class="c1">produce</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;was ten. However, if Velgrynd created ten of them, the amount of magicules she had left would be zero, and her fighting ability would be reduced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd believed it would be more efficient to keep at least 50 percent of her magicules, since they could be shared with any &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;. Therefore, she kept the number of split bodies to three or four at most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">There was one more limitation. It was the damage done to the Split Body. If the body was erased without issue, the full 10 percent of magicules would be returned. However, if the body was damaged, the amount of magicule returned would be proportionally less. This was the strategy that Rimuru had envisioned, and in a sense, it was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">In this case, her magicules were depleted by five percent. Incidentally, Gravity Collapse, the nuclear magic that Carrera finally activated with all her might, had consumed less than one percent of Velgrynd&rsquo;s magicules. That was how enormous the amount of magicules in a True Dragon was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, </span><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd was not completely immortal, even if she appeared invincible at first glance. Physical damage was pointless, but if you slowly depleted her energy, you would eventually be able to knock her down sooner or later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Although the probability was very small, Velgrynd had come to realize this possibility. As some of the strongest in this world, they might be able to defeat her. Although she had said they were of no threat, that had just been a bluff to break their spirits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Velgrynd was convinced. The three demon girls could be a useful trump card against Velzard. If she could get Testarossa and the others to join her in the fight against her sister, victory would be assured. That was why Velgrynd spoke words of invitation once more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;You understand, don&rsquo;t you? No matter how much you struggle, you cannot defeat me, so there&rsquo;s no point in fighting any more, is there? Just help me out a little and I will give you your freedom, so why don&rsquo;t you just surrender to me now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">The offer was the biggest concession that the proud Velgrynd could make.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Nevertheless, </span><span class="c1">the three ladies</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;rejected it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;You want me to betray Rimuru-sama? That&rsquo;s a funny joke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re really looking down on us too much. It&rsquo;s common knowledge that demons do not break their contracts, right? Just because we </span><span class="c1">are losing</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;does not mean we will betray him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">You tell me</span><span class="c4 c1">. Certainly, there are some demons who can be negotiated with. There might even be some who only work with their own interests. But you should know that I would never betray </span><span class="c1">His Lordship</span><span class="c4 c1">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Each of the three spoke their true feelings and unleashed a simultaneous attack on Velgrynd to remind her of their displeasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">These attacks, with their maximum force, destroyed Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; in an instant, causing Velgrynd to consume another nine percent of her magicules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Negotiations had broken down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Well then. </span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s unfortunate. Gravely</span><span class="c4 c1">.&rdquo; Velgrynd, who had created a new &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;, muttered and </span><span class="c1">gave a devastating smile</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">And then, the time of </span><span class="c1">thrashing </span><span class="c4 c1">had begun.</span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

It was up to Dolph, the captain of the Pegasus Knights, to be cautious about that and lead the way.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">However, his fears were unfounded. The &ldquo;Gravity Collapse&rdquo; maintained by Velgrynd had completely blocked off any influence on the surroundings. On the ground, the battle between the demon girls and Velgrynd seemed to have begun. And yet, the crimson pillar was still standing strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel felt a chill run down his spine as he grasped this fact. However, he did not show it and shouted loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but that is Velgrynd. To be able to produce a clone of the same level as the main body, what else could this be but a nightmare? But fear not. Know that we have powerful reinforcements that also defy logic!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel&rsquo;s voice reached the ears of the knights. It was imposing and majestic, and erased the fear from everyone&rsquo;s hearts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel, in truth, was terrified.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">In the face of such an overwhelming presence, there was little that a Saint could do. Even if they attempted to resist, the difference in power was too great. However, he did not give up. His sense of responsibility as a king strengthened his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More importantly, the reinforcements from his beloved younger co-disciple (Rimuru) were showing him that it was too early to despair.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The three demons Velgrynd was fighting now were inferior in terms of magicule quantity alone. Despite this, they were boldly challenging their opponent, who was almost a hundred times stronger than them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Kukuku, seeing them like that, how can I, as a king, complain about anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel made a strong vow in his heart.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This resolve spread to Gazel&rsquo;s companions and the knights under his command. By the time they reached their destination, all the fear had vanished from their hearts.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other side of the crimson pillar was a battlefield that would be their destination.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It was a large open grassland where a large army could be deployed. The ground was stained crimson with the color of blood. This was most likely the blood of the Empire Mixed Corps, which was making shady transactions&mdash;a proof of their demise. There were nearly a hundred people on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One man who stood out from the rest was Lieutenant Kondou, who wore a different uniform.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">He threw his gaze at Gazel, giving off an overwhelming presence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, Footman, Teare, and about thirty of Yuuki&rsquo;s former comrades were gathered here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were also nearly fifty Imperial Guardians. They were deployed to protect Kagali, determined not to let anything interfere with the ceremony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On Kondou&rsquo;s side, a group of men in uniform could be seen. They were employees of the Intelligence Bureau, and some of them were also Imperial Guardians. In other words, the best of the Empire&rsquo;s forces were all gathered here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of location, Kagali was on the outer edge of the crimson pillar.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">She was immersed in a ritual, bathed in a rain of blood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was standing on the sidelines, watching over her.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">After creating a &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; on the other side of the crimson pillar, she came back to this side to prevent the three demon girls from interfering with the magic. Even the mighty Velgrynd, with only one Split Body, would have her hands full casting one of the most powerful spells in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For this reason, Velgrynd seemed to have no intention of making a move and instead planned to simply spectate the battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1 c14 c6 c17"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel confirmed the situation in the sky.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">He then began his descent with calmness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou greeted Gazel and the others as they landed on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is an honor to finally meet you&mdash;the famed champion&mdash;King Gazel,&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Kondou spoke brazenly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel snorted and raised his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Head of the Imperial Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant Kondou.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re the &lsquo;Information Monster.&rsquo; Interesting. I shall be your opponent, so quickly draw your sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel recognized Kondou&rsquo;s strength at a glance. When his skill &lsquo;Though Read,&rsquo; which he used the moment they got face to face, didn&rsquo;t work, he considered him to be his equal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, he will be my&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vaughn, I need you to stay out of the way and take care of the others. You guys too. I am the only one who can handle him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel looked around at the others who entered this decisive battle and spoke up to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine was the first to nod in agreement at Gazel&rsquo;s order.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That person is a bit more than we can handle. Let us at least remove the obstacles and allow King Gazel to fight in peace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jaine&rsquo;s decision was met with a nod from Dolph.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Understood. Everyone, listen up! They may be outnumbered, but do not underestimate our opponent&rsquo;s strength! Form into groups of five and engage in aerial combat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He assessed the enemies and gave out an appropriate instruction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An unobstructed assault from above was the Pegasus Knights&rsquo; main tactic. This time, however, the strategy was to take advantage of their greater numbers and mess with the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki&rsquo;s comrades and the Imperial Guardians were as strong as the Sage class. Sage level was equivalent to Special A rank in the Freedom Association&rsquo;s threat scale which was as strong as an archdemon.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Those at this level were worthy of being called champions, as they could reach the Demon Lord Seed if they were cultivated properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph&rsquo;s subordinates were only Over A rank when working together with a pegasus. Dolph himself was a sage, and while some of his men were stronger than others, they appeared to be no match in a one-on-one battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph did not see it exactly, but he could feel on his skin that the opposing troops were dangerous. While the chances were better than fighting Velgrynd, he believed it would not be an equitable fight. That was why he gave such an order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The goal was not to destroy the enemy, but to distract the enemy by using the advantage of flying. Buying time by doing so was Dolph&rsquo;s true purpose.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">He wanted to stay out of Gazel&rsquo;s way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Pegasus Knights read his intentions and reacted immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I shall do my part, trusting that His Majesty will win. Besides, the reinforcements will be here soon!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph had made his decision.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">And it was affirmed by a cheerful voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! We&rsquo;re a little late, so it seems. This big thing was heavier than I thought, so we had a hard time carrying it. But now that we&rsquo;re here, rest assured! Take pleasure in this battle with peace of mind!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whooo! That&rsquo;s Gabil-sama for you, so cool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting more and more manly. I will follow you anywhere, so you better be prepared!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Gabil&rsquo;s men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Held in the hands of the Hiryuu members was a chain that connected them to a huge object.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It was the Demon Colossus. It had taken a hundred people to bring it here by air. The Demon Colossus had no issues waiting for the enemy in the labyrinth, but its massive body was a liability when it came to the battlefield. Its fighting ability was perfect, but its movement speed was very slow. Even so, its melee speed was so fast that the problem had been overlooked until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This problem needs improvement, but now that you&rsquo;ve brought it this far, I shall do my best,&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Gadra exclaimed enthusiastically. Now was the time to return the favor he said, entering the Demon Colossus with a motivated look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra turned his gaze to Kondou, but quickly averted it. Seeing that King Gazel was dealing with him, he felt that he should not interfere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then he took notice of Velgrynd. </span><span class="c1 c2">So, Marshal-dono&rsquo;s true identity was the Scorch Dragon Velgrynd after all. But if so, I don&rsquo;t understand Damrada&rsquo;s intentions. Did he really swear an oath of allegiance to His Majesty? Why did he need to order Bernie and Jiwu to protect Masayuki? I don&rsquo;t understand. I don&rsquo;t, but&hellip; Now is not the time to worry about that. If Velgrynd makes a move, the mission is over. I&rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on her to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that in mind, Gadra sent the Demon Colossus towards the elegantly standing Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1 c14 c6 c17"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After seeing Gadra off, Gabil flew to Dolph&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems Gadra-dono has volunteered to take care of Velgrynd-sama. We will eliminate those who will be in the way, as planned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, how reliable, Gabil-dono. In that case, let us get to work on the joint operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. My team will take the lead against the enemy and leave the support to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil and Dolph nodded at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As agreed upon in advance, the Hiryuu, with their excellent fighting ability, would take the lead. The dragonewts, with their superior defensive capabilities, would not be easily killed. In additi</span><span class="c1 c5">on, Gabil</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;s team</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;w</span><span class="c1">as</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">lavishly supplied with</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;full potions. As long as they didn&rsquo;t die instantly, they could be revived, making them a good shield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Now then, Dolph-dono, I&rsquo;ll leave the command to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huh, wait?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Dolph was surprised by Gabil&rsquo;s undiscussed action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! I am the &lsquo;Dra</span><span class="c1">c</span><span class="c1 c5">o Lord&rsquo; Gabil! </span><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s fight without cowardice</span><span class="c1 c5">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Gabil was unconcerned about Dolph&rsquo;s behavior and launched an assault towards what appeared to be Kondou&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">close associates</span><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;one of </span><span class="c1">them</span><span class="c1 c5">.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Seeing Gabil, Gobua could only stare blankly. They had been the last to arrive, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped as they had run across the ground. Even so, their speed was commensurate with their Over A rank, and they were just in time for the start of the war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only that, but they had managed to get behind the enemy troops as planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The fact that Gabil-sama went alone means that the man&rsquo;s ability must be outstanding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobua&rsquo;s comment was countered by the man standing beside her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? I can only see a weak, bespectacled kid who&rsquo;s good at paperwork, though?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Phobio, the Black Leopard Fang of Karion&rsquo;s Beastketeers. For some reason, he hadn&rsquo;t returned to his home country, but had followed Gobua before he knew it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inwardly, Gobua was happy, but she was still in charge of the Kurenai by Benimaru&rsquo;s orders. She had to be stern in official duties, and so cautioned Phobio.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Phobio-dono, your abilities are commendable, but you would do well to develop a better eye for the strength of your enemies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s harsh, Gobua. Drop the honorific, call me Phobio.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is wartime and we&rsquo;re on a mission. I expect you to keep your private and public life in order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two of them continued their conversation, but to their subordinates, it just looked like they were flirting. It was a tense battlefield, but for some reason there was a warm feeling in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what happens after this?&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Phobio asked, his expression suddenly turning serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobua changed her mindset and responded.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;We will stay here and bide our time. We have already failed to achieve our tactical victory conditions, and now the mission is doomed to failure. Depending on what Velgrynd-sama does, we&rsquo;ll be wiped out. If all we wish to do is survive, the best choice is to run away, but that is not an option we can take. In short, the most important thing is to reduce the number of people in our way and lighten the burden of His Majesty Rimuru as much as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the expression of someone who had made up their mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they kept Velgrynd here, then Rimuru would be able to take advantage of the opportunity and take out Emperor Rudra. Or, perhaps, get him to agree to a ceasefire agreement, which had been the point of the operation.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">However, that plan collapsed when Velgrynd released a &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;. Normally, all operations should have been suspended at that point, but the people with the authority to make that decision were currently unreachable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was the supreme decision maker in this situation.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">And Gabil&rsquo;s decision was to continue the operation. Testarossa and the others agreed, and Gobua had no objections.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Do what you can</span><span class="c1">. That was all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was unclear how many &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; Velgrynd could produce, but they were prepared to stall them all. And if possible, they were going to interrupt the ritual Kagali was performing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you trying to kill yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. His Majesty Rimuru will never allow us to die. So, no casualties will be allowed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Gobua&rsquo;s outrageous command, the Kurenai all nodded quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Velgrynd moves, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to stop her, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If she does, we&rsquo;ll leave her to Gadra-dono and run.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Gobua gave a wink in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That look had enough destructive power to shut Phobio up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;m going to stop thinking so hard and go a little wild. It looks like I have a history with some of these guys, so I should say hello.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio had once been tricked by Footman and Teare and had made a painful mistake in the past. However, he didn&rsquo;t hold a grudge against them because it was all due to his inexperience. On the contrary, he was even grateful to them, believing that he had been able to grow from that experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was a simple and vivacious man, just like a beastman ought to be. It was precisely because he was such a man that seeing his nemesis being manipulated gave him something to think about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything rash.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise that, but I swear I&rsquo;ll try not to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With these words, Phobio joined the fight.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lieutenant Kondou faced King Gazel.</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The bespectacled intelligence officer was spotted by Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman and Teare headed for Vaughn and Anrietta. Phobio intervened, and Gobua and the others tried to assess the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of Velgrynd who was contemptuously looking at the battlefield, was a Demon Colossus controlled by Master Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And thus, the battles began.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

He was facing the man Kondou, not as a king, but as a warrior and a swordsman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou drew his military sword as Gazel had told him to do. He, too, quietly exhaled in admiration at Gazel&rsquo;s stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s impressive. I guess the title of Sword Saint was not an exaggeration.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These words were not flattery, and he meant them sincerely. But Gazel snickered back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speak for yourself. Such words only sound sarcastic when spoken by someone like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those were his true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou&rsquo;s stance was beautiful, and Gazel could see no flaw in it. Kondou now was holding his sword in both hands, unlike when he had fought Footman, he was in a serious stance. And there was an even more surprising fact. The two men&rsquo;s stances were as identical as if they had rehearsed it together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They exchanged blows for a few rounds in silence, and both of them largely grasped the other&rsquo;s strength. They were convinced that it was no coincidence that their stances were identical. Gazel&rsquo;s swordsmanship had been learned from Hakurou, and although he incorporated his own techniques, his basic stance was faithful to Hakurou&rsquo;s teachings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was handed down from Hakurou&rsquo;s grandfather, Byakuya Araki, as the &ldquo;Oboro-Ryu.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c1 c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">There was no one else but Hakurou to whom this school of swordsmanship was passed down. Even Gazel, who was a direct disciple of Hakurou, did not know everything about the Oboro-Ryu. He knew there were secrets yet to be discovered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the country of monsters, Hakurou was involved in the training of soldiers as the instructor. Naturally, he would have taught them the basics of swordsmanship, but it was unlikely that this would have been spread to the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To begin with, swordsmanship was not something that could be learned overnight. That is why Gazel asked the question. And strangely, the same question came out of Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That stance, how do you know Oboro-Ryu?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I had suspected it when I heard about it, but His Majesty Gazel&rsquo;s technique is similar to my &ldquo;Oboro Shinmei-Ryu.&rdquo; Who did you learn it from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They stared at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel was the first to open his mouth. &ldquo;Oboro Shinmei-Ryu&hellip;so it&rsquo;s not the same as Oboro-Ryu, you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou accepted the question without expression and pondered for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">In the Dwarven Kingdom, orthodox swordsmanship using a combination of a one-handed sword and a shield is the mainstream. That means this must have something to do with the information I got about a certain monster who is very skilled with a sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the little information he had, Lieutenant Kondou arrived at a mostly correct answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel asked Kondou a question as if he was impatient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you not going to answer my question?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please do not be impatient. The Oboro-Ryu is probably of the same school as the one I learned. That is why I would like to ask you a question instead. Isn&rsquo;t it impossible that the same school of swordsmanship could have been created from this world by chance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s true&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While muttering, Gazel remembered. He recalled a story about Hakurou&rsquo;s grandfather which had been told to him during his training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was told by my master Hakurou-dono that the Oboro-Ryu was instilled in him by his grandfather. I heard that he was a &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; from another world which would make sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unknown to both Gazel and Kondou, Byakuya Araki had a younger brother. That person had replaced his brother as the founder of the school and introduced the &ldquo;Oboro Shinmei-Ryu&rdquo; in the world where Kondou was born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was to fight against the mountain and river monsters</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;as </span><span class="c1 c2">the sword that dispelled evil</span><span class="c1">. Kondou was one of those who had fought against evil and had been learning the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu from a position close to the source.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, it&rsquo;s interesting to know that we are fellow students.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou began to laugh in a rare and amused way. He was not usually one to reveal his emotions, so this laughter seemed to highlight his coldness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have a proposal, Your Majesty Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A fellowship. I have determined that His Majesty Gazel is powerful enough to join our ranks. If you disarm and promise to swear allegiance to my Emperor, I promise to cease all acts of aggression against your country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;ll accept that offer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think you will. Rationally speaking, it is the best way to minimize casualties.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">He&rsquo;s right</span><span class="c1">&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Gazel thought. It was a desperately needed offer. In order to protect the people of the Dwarven Kingdom, it would be correct to accept the offer. As a monarch, he should accept it without question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that the threat of Velgrynd was known, there was no way to win. The conditions for victory in this battle were so vague that they should never have been set in the first place. Before heavy casualties were inflicted, Rimuru and the others would settle things with Rudra&mdash;it was wishful thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">If it&rsquo;s for the sake of the people&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">Almost considering it, Gazel chuckled to dispel his doubts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ridiculous! You think you&rsquo;ve already won; has no one told you overconfidence is one&rsquo;s greatest enemy?! See how I correct you for your arrogant thoughts!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While shouting this, Gazel focused his thoughts on the enemy in front of him. Chasing away all distractions, he thought only of defeating Kondou. Then, with mind, body, and his beloved sword as one, he unleashed the full force of his haki as Saint. What appeared there was a champion who could almost reach the level of an awakened demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, Kondou&rsquo;s demeanor remained relaxed even when he saw Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My my, it seems you are a wise king in name only. In that case it can&rsquo;t be helped. I will take care of you before your reputation goes down the drain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words signaled the beginning of a battle between the &ldquo;Saints.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few minutes had passed. Kondou was starting to gain the upper hand. He could easily cancel out Gazel&rsquo;s &lsquo;champion&rsquo;s haki.&rsquo; By wearing the same quality of aura, he was able to nullify all effects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the same even in pure swordplay. Gazel unleashed a series of vertical slashes with &ldquo;Oboro Chiten Gourai,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;but Kondou, whilst shifting his body to evade the attacks, swiftly unleashed a sideways counterattack with the &ldquo;Shippu-Raiha&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Kondou then connected it with his fastest thrust, the &ldquo;Shiden Totsu,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;but Gazel parried it back with a &ldquo;Ryusui Zan.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two fellow students knew each other&rsquo;s techniques very well. However, Gazel&rsquo;s response gradually began to lag. Kondou had mastered more techniques than him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew it. There are some techniques that I have never seen before in the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu. Even I, a close follower of the original art, do not know all of them. Hakurou, was it? I was skeptical about how much a mere monster could comprehend the true nature of the sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Kondou&rsquo;s honest opinion. However, it was not meant as a mockery of Hakurou. The way of the sword was profound and had been handed down from generation to generation. Kondou himself was proud of his own school, and that is why he said what he said. However, his comment struck a nerve in Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you insulting my master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He glared at Kondou with more determination than ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, someone arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho. King Gazel, you&rsquo;re not trained enough if you easily lose your cool on the battlefield. I will take your place for a while, so you can stay there and cool your head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou, who had been leading the rear troops as Gobua&rsquo;s advisor, arrived late.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Hakurou had caught Kondou&rsquo;s extremely fast quick-draw slash with his own cane-sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? You can stop this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">On Hakurou&rsquo;s forehead, his &lsquo;Third Eye,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Celestial Eye&rsquo; was opened. It had now broken through the realm of Extra Skills and was about to exceed the realm of Unique Skills. That was why he was able to deal with Kondou&rsquo;s quick-draw sword technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excellent sword-drawing technique. I would call it anything but a strange coincidence that you are of the same school as my grandfather? Kid, you can test and see just how far I, whom you call a mere monster, can understand the true essence of the sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, interesting. If you say that much, then I shall cut you down to size.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, before Gazel&rsquo;s eyes, the battle between Kondou and Hakurou began.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou had the best odds to win. Hakurou&rsquo;s ability was certain, he could see that at a glance. But there was no doubt in Kondou&rsquo;s mind that monsters did not understand the true essence of the sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was because the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu was the sword that dispelled evil. There was no way that a monster could learn a sword art designed specifically to combat them&mdash;it was only natural for Kondou to think that. Besides, it was beyond anyone&rsquo;s imagination that the true founder, the elder brother of Oboro Shinmei-Ryu founder, had come to this world in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">It surprised me that he could even perform the secret techniques, but those that go beyond the hidden techniques can only be passed on to individuals who are descended from the original line. I&rsquo;m not sure how proficient the &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; was, but it would be impossible for him to teach the hidden techniques to a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a way, it was inevitable that Kondou had made a judgment based on his own common sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a big mistake, and an unusual assumption for Kondou. It was a big price to pay&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou and Kondou faced each other. Then, as soon as they got at a deadly distance, they simultaneously launched their attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Baika Gokatotsu.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou, with his pride as a swordsman, showed off his well-honed technique. It was only because Hakurou was a fellow student of the same school that he had made such a foolish move. In the back of his mind, he was calmly thinking that he should get serious and finish it quickly. Yet, the action he&rsquo;d taken was intended for showing off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a rash conduct that was out of character for Kondou, who was usually calm and composed. He intended to impress his peers in this world by demonstrating the greatest technique he had learned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Gokatotsu&rdquo; was a stabbing technique that symbolized the plum blossom. It was the finest technique that Kondou had been taught and was one of the hidden techniques that have never been passed down to outsiders. It consisted of five stabs aimed at five of the ten vital points of the human body&mdash;the eyes, throat, heart, kidneys, solar plexus, crotch, and also both shoulders as a feint. The aim was changed according to the situation, so it required a skillful technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even among his peers, there were very few who had mastered this hidden technique. That is why it was a miscalculation to find Hakurou in such a place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yaezakura Hakkasen.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou&rsquo;s choice was a supreme technique&mdash;a series of continuous flowing slashes, in an infinite variety of combinations, that would slay the enemy eight times in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou and Hakurou were evenly matched in Proficiency, but there is a great difference between them in basic combat ability. In Hakurou&rsquo;s opinion, Kondou boasted a physical ability more than ten times greater than that of Hakurou. That is why Hakurou&rsquo;s defeat would be certain if his technique did not work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that determination in mind, Hakurou pulled out his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nuu?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou had won overwhelmingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou had wanted to strike a fatal blow to Kondou, even if it meant they would both get hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was what he had hoped for, but the result was something the both of them did not expect. Hakurou&rsquo;s sword scattered like eight petals at a speed that no one else could even see. However, all of them were canceled out by Kondou&rsquo;s five petals, and the attack ultimately missed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result of Kondou avoiding getting hit at the lower portion of his body, a graze to the cheek was the most that could be done. Still, this was a disappointing result from Kondou&rsquo;s point of view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think there was a swordsman in this world who was better than me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hakkasen&rdquo; was superior to Kondou&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gokatotsu.&rdquo; This fact shattered Kondou&rsquo;s perception and made him admit to his mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was Kondou who won the battle. The difference in strength was too great even though Hakurou was able to cancel his special move. Hakurou&rsquo;s arms were torn apart by the recent exchange, rendering them useless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even with the supreme technique, I could not reach you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you did. I apologize for looking down on you. Also, I would like to ask you. What was your grandfather&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou apologized for looking down on Hakurou as a monster. He also acknowledged that Hakurou was a better swordsman than himself and paid him that respect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was a man who was sincere about the sword. But at the same time, he did not judge things based on his personal feelings. That is who Kondou Tatsuya was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho. Byakuya Araki was my grandfather&rsquo;s name. He was a great swordsman, but he left for the afterlife</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;a long time ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is a shame. Araki is the name of his family. Perhaps he is related to the founder of the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu. If he had reached Sage level, he would have been one of the strongest swordsmen in this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Kondou said a silent prayer. He was truly a man who was serious only for his own school of sword. Hakurou looked at Kondou in dismay and asked him a question, thinking it was worth the try.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My grandfather was an eccentric man who liked living an ordinary life. More importantly though, would you mind retreating here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sensing Kondou&rsquo;s respect for him as well, Hakurou made his request. However, the request was rejected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can at least guarantee your personal safety, but the war cannot be stopped. I have a belief that the worst thing one can do is to do things half heartedly,&rdquo; Kondou spoke with no doubts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s true,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hakurou thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou was not in a hurry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I already considered I was going to lose. It is impossible for me to get back into the fight with these arms, but I believe I&rsquo;ve achieved my goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, Hakurou&rsquo;s goal was not to win, but to show Gazel the battle between himself and Kondou. The sword saint Gazel Dwargo would have understood Hakurou&rsquo;s technique just by looking at it. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t learn it right away, he would have been able to get some sort of hint. That was Hakurou&rsquo;s idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this time, even Kondou had used his secret technique. This surely increased Gazel&rsquo;s chances of winning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, I will stop here. I do not need your protection. I have no intention to live in shame. In my final moments, I plan to take out as many enemy soldiers as I can. But now is not the time. I shall concentrate on healing these hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou&rsquo;s hands were badly injured and wouldn&rsquo;t recover even with a full potion</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1">. The secret of the &lsquo;Battlewill&rsquo; was to destroy the target by permeating fighting aura in them. Kondou&rsquo;s fighting aura had penetrated Hakurou&rsquo;s defenses. Because of this, there was no way to heal the injuries except by neutralizing them with his own demonic aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Hakurou turned to Gazel with a nonchalant look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, King Gazel. Has your head cooled down?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, I got excited, seeing my master&rsquo;s skills.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hohoho. The truth is I really had no intention of teaching you, but I can&rsquo;t say that now. I will leave the rest to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Hakurou stepped back, Gazel stood before Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Hakurou left the front line with his head held high, as if his role was now over.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

It&rsquo;s time to get back to work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! I&rsquo;m reluctant, but I agree with you. I must live up to my master&rsquo;s expectations, so I must get serious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both Kondou and Gazel acted differently from earlier. They had finished assessing each other&rsquo;s abilities and had become serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Gazel, he was grateful to Hakurou. If he had fought Kondou the way he was, he would have been defeated. The hidden technique that Kondou displayed, the &lsquo;Gokatotsu,&rsquo; was impossible to defend against at first sight. Even if he had miraculously avoided a fatal wound, he would have been destroyed from the inside by the fighting aura, just like Hakurou had been, and would have been rendered incapable of fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I didn&rsquo;t realize that a refined fighting aura would pose such a threat. I knew that it was the secret of the Battlewill, but it seems that I hadn&rsquo;t fully understood it yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he reflected on this, Gazel felt his spirits lift. He realized that he could still get stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kondou, isn&rsquo;t it? I will give you a taste of my full power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he said this, Gazel released his trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spirit Summoning! Come, nameless Spirit King of the Earth!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The summoned Spirit King of the Earth dwelled within Gazel, who had unleashed his power as a Saint. It was completely &lsquo;unified&rsquo; and had an energy that rivaled or almost surpassed that of an old, awakened demon lord. Although there was a time limit, this was Gazel&rsquo;s trump card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou, however, was unfazed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou spoke blandly, unperturbed by Gazel&rsquo;s domineering aura.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel did not show any displeasure at his words, but silently held his sword up to his eyes. He sharpened his mind, refined his will, and let it flow into the sword.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c15 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image17.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel was now in perfect control of the enormous amount of energy that had &lsquo;unified&rsquo; with the Spirit King of the Earth. It was a feeling that he hadn&rsquo;t felt before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">He truly is an incredible master. He helped me realize the secret. I can win. As I am now, the current me can reach even greater heights!</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">Gazel felt the improvement in his &lsquo;mind,&rsquo; &lsquo;technique,&rsquo; and &lsquo;body.&rsquo; By &lsquo;mind,&rsquo; it was his Skill. By fully utilizing the Unique Skill &lsquo;Dictator&rsquo;, Gazel&rsquo;s willpower was at full power. By &lsquo;technique,&rsquo; it was his Arts. In the Oboro-Ryu he learned from Hakurou, the &lsquo;Battlewill&rsquo;&mdash;the art of transforming willpower into physical power is crucial. The current Gazel would be able to efficiently converge all the energy that flowed through his body. And that was the &lsquo;body.&rsquo; In other words, he would use the Unique Skill &lsquo;Dictator&rsquo; to consolidate his energy and convert it into the greatest blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">No one can defeat my sword</span><span class="c1">&mdash;with such a drive, Gazel made his move. A blow of divine speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it would never reach Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Pwang!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A small sound rang out and Gazel fell to his knees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel coughed up blood and looked dumbfounded at the blood seeping down his abdomen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Kondou&rsquo;s right hand was a Nambu pistol, a cloud of gunpowder still smoking from the muzzle. The lethal bullet that had defeated Gazel had been fired from that very pistol.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip; Your pride as a swordsman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel, his face twisted in anger and humiliation, shouted while coughing up blood.</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">But those words fell on deaf ears to Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you, play time&rsquo;s over. There is no need for pride on the battlefield. My job is to win by any means necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou spoke in a terribly cold voice. He was a different person from the one who had been so obsessed with his own school of swordsmanship up until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Forget that! I won&rsquo;t let this be the end&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel desperately tried to stand up. However, his body couldn&rsquo;t move as he wanted, and he fell to the ground once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only natural. The bullet Kondou had shot was not ordinary, but rather a special bullet that contained Kondou&rsquo;s own will&mdash; Necrosis. It was not something borrowed from Emperor Rudra, but an Ultimate Skill that Kondou had manifested on his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes&mdash;Kondou had awakened to the ultimate power by his own ability. The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo; was one that governed &ldquo;battle.&rdquo; As such, it was very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was the one who fought on behalf of Rudra&mdash;he who desired to attain the throne of God despite being human. And Necrosis, which Kondou used earlier, was one of the powers of the &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon.&rsquo; It had the effect of destroying the target&rsquo;s mana circuits and could even kill spiritual life forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gazel was by no means weak. On the contrary, he was one of the most powerful beings in this world. Depending on the conditions, he was capable of defeating even an awakened demon lord. Nevertheless, there was a strength barrier between him and Kondou that could not be overcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the existence of an Ultimate Skill. In this aspect alone, the battle had already been decided before the fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Give up your futile efforts. I have no intention of killing Your Majesty. I will detain you for the time being, but I promise to release you once I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou spoke in an indifferent voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While it was not a falsehood, it was not the whole truth, either. Before letting him go, he was planning to take control of him with the &lsquo;Dominion Bullet.&rsquo; Now that he was currently in control of Kagali, he wanted to capture him alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Terrifyingly ruthless, and rational. This was another essence of Kondou Tatsuya.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou was not in a position to move right now. He could only stand there, resigned at the sight of Kondou&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, it appeared as if Kondou&rsquo;s victory was assured&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Let&rsquo;s fight without cowardice!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shouting this, Gabil identified the enemy and charged, leaving his subordinates behind. Although this was an inappropriate act for a commander, it was not a mistake from a tactical standpoint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the enemy&rsquo;s strength was exceptional. The enemy was not conspicuous within the group, simply a good-looking bespectacled man. Nevertheless, Gabil called out in a loud voice without any sign of hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You there.

You know what that means, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing how their peer&rsquo;s demeanor had changed, everyone understood that Marco had been playing the good-natured intelligence officer in disguise. And they understood that he had the right to give them orders, and what he had just said was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good luck!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaving those words behind, Marco&rsquo;s companions scattered. He let out a sigh of relief and turned his snake-like narrowing eyes to Gabil. Marco, too, had seen through Gabil&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this world, it was meaningless to challenge an outstanding individual with a group. Marco was well aware of this and drove away even those who were as strong as an Imperial Knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Gabil-san; you&rsquo;ve done it now. You must pay for the crime of robbing me of my office lifestyle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! The Single Digits are the ones Rimuru-sama considered as dangerous. To be able to deal with such prey, it looks like an opportunity has come my way!&rdquo; Gabil replied happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the battle between the two men began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco was a man who was characterized by his lack of notable features. He became an Imperial Knight about 800 years ago. Because he possessed the Unique Skill &lsquo;Impersonator&rsquo;, a Skill specialized in undercover, he had caught the attention of Damrada, the Commander at that time. The Unique Skill &lsquo;Impersonator&rsquo; had a noteworthy power. It was the ability to transform into the exact likeness of the person he saw. It was not a &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo; like the Unique Skill &lsquo;Usurper&rsquo; that Hinata possessed; it could entirely mimic the same person. However, there was a limit to how much he could mimic. If the target was significantly more powerful than him, he could not mimic everything&mdash;that was its weakness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, the more powerful people he met, the more versatile their strength would become. That was why Marco had risen to the rank of a Single Digit after overcoming a great upheaval and awakening as a Saint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was about a hundred years after Marco became an Imperial Knight. It was precisely because of this that Marco could not shake his awe of the man Kondou. Even if he was a &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; from another world and possessed a soul more powerful than that of ordinary people, his strength was still difficult to comprehend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first person Kondou challenged in the rank battles was Marco. In that battle, Marco was exposed to Kondou&rsquo;s extraordinary strength. He had always thought that Kondou was favored by the emperor, but now he realized that he had been wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou possessed a fighting ability that even Marco, a &lsquo;Saint,&rsquo; could not imitate with his Unique Skill &lsquo;Impersonator.&rsquo; With this ability, Kondou easily defeated the top soldiers to get the position of a commander. Even the four horsemen, who were all monsters in Marco&rsquo;s eyes, had been defeated by Kondo without a hitch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For this reason, Marco worshiped Kondou. He even emulated Kondou&rsquo;s insistence on the rank of Lieutenant and kept his own rank of Ensign. He had stayed in the Intelligence Bureau just to serve Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco was now facing a powerful opponent by the name of Gabil. He also fought back with a spear but realized that he could not win the battle as it was. That is why Marco decided to change himself into the form of the person he believed to be the strongest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco distanced himself from Gabil and transformed into the form of Kondou. By adding the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; lent by the Emperor to the Unique Skill &lsquo;Impersonator&rsquo;, it was possible to transform with even greater precision. The current Marco had power close to that of Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hoh, that&rsquo;s strange. Is that what you really look like?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil asked, to which Marco, in the form of Kondou, replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. This figure is a replica of who I believe to be the strongest man I know. The Four Horsemen were strong too, but not as strong as Lieutenant Kondou. In fact&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco glanced at the battlefield next to him and continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems even His Majesty King Gazel, the renowned champion, is no match for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Gabil let out a low &ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo; He knew from his wide-range &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo; that the allied forces were not doing well, that Hakurou had left the front lines, and that King Gazel was struggling, as had just been pointed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, it seems so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From the moment that Lieutenant Kondou appeared, there was no doubt that we would win. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to bother to show my own hand. You never know where the leak will come from and you always want to keep your power hidden, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that carefree question, Marco changed his weapon from a spear to a sword. The Legendary-grade armor Marco had been lent now allowed him to change its shape at will. Marco held his sword in his Kondou form. His appearance was regal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil also held a magical weapon, the Vortex Spear, which was the treasure of the lizardmen. It was a spear entrusted to him by his father, Abil, and he was now familiar with it. The spear had seen many fierce battles and had been reforged by Kurobee when it was damaged. Its performance was unique-grade, but it had been a very reliable partner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it still fell short of the legendary-grade. It is true that the difference in weapon performance is a factor that determines the winner, and this time, Gabil was at an overwhelming disadvantage. However, Gabil also had the &lsquo;Dragon Skin&rsquo;, which was strong enough to reach the mythical-grade level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil believed that his enemy was a &lsquo;Saint,&rsquo; and that he was equal to his awakened self. That is why Gabil did not spare any effort from the beginning, and gave it his all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Will this person be able to penetrate my defenses?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was confident in his defensive capabilities. There was no victory in a fight unless you could inflict decisive damage on your opponent. It didn&rsquo;t matter how many blows you hit, if they were not fatal, they were meaningless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil thought that Marco&rsquo;s weapon would not be able to break through his defenses, but he was not about to let his guard down, and would carefully watch his opponents moves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here I go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, bring it on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s misfortune was that he had become hostile to Marco too early. The power he had awakened was vast, but he had yet to fully harness it for himself. As Ultima had feared, even in his pre-evolutionary stage, Gabil had not handled his magicules well enough. Even with such great power in his hands, Gabil was unable to use it to the full potential. High defense and healing ability&mdash;these two things alone were strong enough, but this time, his opponent was too strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Baika Gokatotsu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vortex Crash!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was able to survive because of his cautious approach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two were evenly matched in strength or Gabil slightly above. However, in terms of Proficiency , Marco, who was impersonating Kondou, was far superior. Actually, Marco could not even imitate 80 percent of Lieutenant Kondou&rsquo;s abilities. The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo; was impossible to reproduce, and if Gazel had been his opponent, defeat would have been inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of Marco&rsquo;s plain strength, he was evenly matched with Gabil. In terms of defense, Gabil&rsquo;s victory would have been assured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victory or defeat was all a matter of chance. Although Marco seemed to have won by a landslide, his victory was paper-thin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good grief, I can&rsquo;t blame Major General Farage. Wasn&rsquo;t it &lsquo;Draco Lord&rsquo; Gabil? No wonder he mistook him for Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco muttered, looking at Gabil as he fell to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this moment, Gabil&rsquo;s fate seemed to be coming to an end&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

It was Souka and the others who had rushed to the scene. And then there were Gabil&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gabil-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die, Gabil!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye. Gabil-sama is not a man who should die in a place like this!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they knew they could not defeat Marco, they still dared to face him. That courage saved Gabil&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Individually, these people were no match for Marco, a &lsquo;Saint,&rsquo; but they were still Special A rank talents. They used healing potions generously, desperately trying to buy some time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Marco&rsquo;s Kondou-inspired technique destroyed the enemy from the inside out with his well-honed fighting aura. Because it nullified the effects of the healing potions, Souka and her subordinates had to be prepared for death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, another one of Gabil&rsquo;s subordinates fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Souka&rsquo;s subordinate, Nanso, fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though there was not that much difference in proficiency, there was too much of a difference in raw power. On top of that, Marco&rsquo;s weapon was legendary-grade. One by one, each of them fell before the inevitable difference in strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, none of them had died yet. With the evolution of Gabil by Rimuru, the people linked to him had also become stronger. Thanks to this, their endurance had increased, and they were narrowly able to escape fatal injuries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the ongoing damage from Marco&rsquo;s wounds prevented them from returning to the front lines. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before they were all killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Gabil shouted, &ldquo;Enough, that&rsquo;s enough, so get out of here! Souka, that&rsquo;s an order. Take everyone and get out of here!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil looked at Souka, desperately trying to rise up. But Souka refused to even look at Gabil and smiled fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I refuse, Brother. I am a subordinate of Souei-sama, so I am not obligated to accept orders from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Besides! If we run away now, we&rsquo;ll end up with dead people! You, Brother, will die too!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souka, normally a calm person, shouted out with all her might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;What are you talking about?!&rdquo; Gabil was speechless and confused. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the role of the commander to reduce casualties as much as possible? Isn&rsquo;t it your job to increase the number of survivors and leave me, who got defeated, behind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was difficult for Gabil to get up right now. He could barely speak his words out loud as he watched his comrades fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, those words were dismissed by Souka.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then my plan is the right one. There are no weaklings among us who can be killed by a single blow. That&rsquo;s why we are going to buy ourselves some time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Keeping on fighting, unconcerned even if a comrade fell. Battling Marco with numbers and being careful not to cause any casualties. By doing so, Souka and the others were looking for a chance to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is foolish! There is no guarantee that help will come&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Rimuru and the rest of the executives were on their way to the Imperial Capital, extra support could not be expected. Even if the other executives who were asleep woke up, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to conveniently rush over here. The three demon girls they were counting on were dealing with an even more powerful enemy, Velgrynd. They were the ones who needed support; thus, there was no way they could ask for help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil understood this and had decided that he had no choice but to retreat in this situation. However, it was Gabil&rsquo;s subordinates who disagreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Gabil! You&rsquo;re the one we&rsquo;re waiting for!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Gabil-sama! You&rsquo;re hurt, so heal up soon and get up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye. We will buy time and wait for Gabil-sama&rsquo;s return. That is the only way to save everyone here!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Gabil felt ashamed. He wondered if he, alone, had given up on victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;What have I been doing? All right then! Everyone, hold your ground until I get up!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil shouted, knowing full well what an absurd order it was. Hot tears spilled from his eyes, eloquently expressing Gabil&rsquo;s feelings. The goddess of victory would not abandon those who did not give up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone responded to Gabil&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh dear, you&rsquo;re as reckless as ever, aren&rsquo;t you? Allow this humble self to help you out here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an order from my lady; her precious toy, Gabil-dono, is not allowed to die, so I shall go to his aid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arriving out of nowhere, Veyron and Zonda, Ultima&rsquo;s subordinates, were standing there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Although it would be better for us if you didn&rsquo;t survive,&rdquo; Zonda continued to mutter, but Gabil couldn&rsquo;t hear him over the noise of the battlefield. That was a very lucky thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron, looking like a butler, stood beside Souka. He held up his cane to Marco.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My humble self shall deal with this person, so Souka-dono, please assist me. Zonda here will help with the healing, and the rest of you will take care of the injured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, let&rsquo;s go!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron moved as soon as he heard Souka&rsquo;s reply. He was a marquis-level demon peer. His energy ratio was less than a quarter of Marco&rsquo;s, but Veyron&rsquo;s proficiency was superior. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t win, he succeeded in irritating Marco.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, just how annoying can you be! You keep coming one after another before I can finish you off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. It is our mission to grasp the enemy&rsquo;s strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I understand how annoying it is when someone mimics what you&rsquo;re good at. I&rsquo;ll take you down at once and take out that other dangerous&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;An opening!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While fighting back against Veyron, Marco turned his murderous intent on Gabil. Not missing a beat, Souka made her move. The shouting was intentional. She was trying to draw Marco&rsquo;s attention to herself and make him hesitate. If she could get her kunai to hit him, it would be all the better. But even if that didn&rsquo;t work out, Veyron&rsquo;s blade would strike Marco. That was her judgment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco saw it coming. That&rsquo;s why he made the best choice. That is, he chose not to avoid Souka&rsquo;s kunai. It was the right thing to do. If he had reacted to Souka, he would have been wounded much worse by Veyron.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring Souka, Marco continued to flick away Veyron&rsquo;s cane. He regretted thinking of something unnecessary during the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Tsk, I&rsquo;ll have to finish them off first. They&rsquo;re really such a pain in the ass!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no doubt that Gabil was the most dangerous. That&rsquo;s why Marco had wanted to finish him off quickly, but he became greedy and ended up getting hurt. It was a minor wound, but he couldn&rsquo;t forgive himself for being wounded in the image of his beloved Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with you first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well now, are you sure you can do it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veyron-dono, perhaps he&rsquo;s just a sore loser?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, I guess so. Well, let&rsquo;s not be impatient and get the job done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, Veyron teamed up with Souka to take on Marco, despite the odds being against them.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the meantime, Zonda was not idle either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, well, this is a nasty technique. Demonic aura&mdash;no, he&rsquo;s a human, so it&rsquo;s a fighting aura. He left energy in the enemy&rsquo;s body so that it continued to emit a wavelength that disturbed the magicules. It&rsquo;s a terrifying technique. In this case, it will also work on spiritual life forms like us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is how he diagnosed Gabil&rsquo;s injury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His diagnosis was correct. Like Damrada&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spiral Permeation Break,&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;it was a type of energy release, where a condensed fighting aura that destroyed the enemy from within.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the essence of the Oboro Shinmei-Ryu&mdash;the &lsquo;Battlewill&rsquo;&mdash;and the reason why it was called a sword that dispelled evil. That is why magicule healing potions could not heal these wounds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Zonda could. He skillfully manipulated the magicules to regulate the disordered energy. He neutralized the fighting aura that Marco had injected and returned Gabil&rsquo;s body to its normal flow of energy. And Gabil did not just sit back and wait for recovery. He yearned for a greater healing power. That desire was about to give Gabil a new power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip; With the situation still unpredictable, Marco released his stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh dear, time has run out. I&rsquo;ve been ordered to return, so I believe that ends our battle here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he said this, Marco transported away from the scene before anyone could say anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, Gabil and the others narrowly escaped death.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

No, the word &lsquo;struggling&rsquo; was an understatement. Vaughn was also a Sage-class opponent and was confident of his strength. However, Footman had a magicule count that could overwhelm Vaughn easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vaughn&rsquo;s armor and spear were Legendary-grade and contributed to his strength. Even so, it was as if he still couldn&rsquo;t reach him. The only reason why he could still fight was because Footman was not rational. Besides, Phobio&rsquo;s help was also great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I, the &lsquo;Black Leopard Fang&rsquo; Phobio, will help you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, Vaughn was suspicious of the man who had come barging in shouting that, but he soon remembered who the man was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">The &ldquo;Black Leopard Fang&rdquo; is one of Demon Lord Karion&rsquo;s Beastketeers! Right, Karion has now ceded to Demon Lord Milim who is also allied to His Majesty Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Deciding that he was not an enemy, Vaughn welcomed the help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you. I was just thinking that this would be difficult to deal with on my own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think I could do it alone either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reflecting on his previous attitude, Phobio calmly assessed his own abilities. He knew instinctively that he could not defeat Footman even in his serious, full-strength &lsquo;beastialized&rsquo; state. That is why Phobio chose to fight together with Vaughn, letting go of his pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Footman was strong, but his attacks were monotonous because he had lost his sense of reason. Both Vaughn and Phobio were wounded, but barely able to stand. They could not expect victory, but the word &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; did not exist in their minds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because, right next to them, their comrades were fighting to the death. Responding to the other clown, Teare, was Anrietta, the Head of the Night Assassins of the Armed Nation of Dwargon, and Gobua, who had joined in the war. With a small group of elites, they were trying to capture the lone Teare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Teare appeared to be acting strangely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, okay? This is not my intention either, but it&rsquo;s an order. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll do my best not to kill you, so please do something to stop me somehow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was talking like that while fighting seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, even though Kagali had ordered Teare to fight, she still had her free will. She could not disobey orders, but she was aware that Kagali was in a state of manipulation. In other words, she was not fighting of her own volition, and did not want to fight at all. That is why Teare was trying to avoid fighting seriously to the utmost extent. Although she joined the battle so as not to violate her orders, she had asked her enemies, Anrietta and the others, to stop her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to respond to Teare&rsquo;s request, Anrietta and the others were carrying out a capture operation. However, the overwhelming difference in strength between the two sides was too great to overcome, and no results had yet been seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That man over there, I&rsquo;m sorry too, okay? I took advantage of you before, but I&rsquo;m not going to cheat you this time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Phobio was indignant when Teare spoke to him. Footman&rsquo;s sense of reason was taken away to keep them from dying&mdash;both Phobio and Vaughn immediately noticed this. He hadn&rsquo;t noticed it when they first met, but the fact that Footman was as powerful as Karion, whom Phobio respects, made him realize that they were no match for him in a proper fight. And for that, Phobio was grateful to Teare for the time being. But:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up! Don&rsquo;t remind me of my dark history. Even if you didn&rsquo;t say it, I am grateful that you made that man go blindly on a rampage!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! You guys are weak, so if Footman was serious, you&rsquo;d be dead by now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to Phobio&rsquo;s retort, Teare launched into an innocent tirade. It was obvious that Teare didn&rsquo;t have any bad intentions, and that she meant what she said. That&rsquo;s why it was even more annoying, but for now, complaining was the best he could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a cheeky brat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up already! Rather than that, you&rsquo;d better work on putting in more effort in restraining yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vaughn and Phobio let out a deep sigh, as if to mentally remember this for later.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difficult situation continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Gobua, she wanted to finish up here and help the rest of the battlefield. Because she judged this to be the easiest opponent. However, the situation was not so simple. Teare was not hostile, but she could not disobey orders. Gobua was not wrong in thinking that Teare would be easy to capture. The reason why the strategy did not work was simply because Teare and Footman were too strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the case of Footman, he could easily tear through an iron net. Half-hearted attacks wouldn&rsquo;t work, and it was difficult to knock him out. It took two strong men, Vaughn and Phobio, to hold him back somehow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Teare on the other hand, even Anrietta, who was confident of her speed, could not catch up with her, and Gobua could not even touch her. They had also prepared a cast net for her, but it was unlikely that they would succeed in catching her alive. Souka and the others would have done better, but they seemed to be too busy fighting with Marco.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the war situation worsened.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the information from Moss, Gobua was able to grasp the situation of the battle. Veyron and Zonda had apparently gone to Gabil&rsquo;s rescue. The situation had returned to a stalemate, but it seemed to have become that much more dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worst of all was Kondou. Hakurou succumbed, and even King Gazel was defeated. It seemed that Agera and Esprit were on their way, but it was doubtful they could even stall for time against Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;If worse comes to worst, I will come out,&rsaquo; Moss said. His role was to assess the situation on behalf of Benimaru. Gobua was to plan the operation based on Moss&rsquo;s information. Even now, while dealing with Teare, Gobua continued to give precise instructions. This was only possible because of Moss&rsquo;s support. If Moss were to go into battle, the front line would collapse at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Please wait for that. In the worst-case scenario, please do so, but will you be able to manage in the first place?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ll make it work.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobua felt depressed, wondering if even Moss couldn&rsquo;t win. He was a self-confident man who treated everyone with arrogance except for certain people, most notably Testarossa. That Moss had made such an uncertain statement about doing his best. In other words, it was proof that Kondou was a very dangerous opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou would be difficult to stop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil had yet to return to the front line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobua and the others were still far from capturing Teare and Footman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this rate, it would be impossible to interrupt Kagali&rsquo;s ritual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was Gadra, but he was currently engaged in a war of words with Velgrynd. If Velgrynd joined the fight, then defeat was certain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">This is the worst. I see now how much we&rsquo;ve been relying on Rimuru-sama and Benimaru-sama&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobua was in a state of regretful introspection, but even if she realized this now, it was still too late. That is why they must never give up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Not yet. The fact that Velgrynd-sama hasn&rsquo;t made a move means that those demons are doing their best. The difference in strength is obvious, but they&rsquo;re still sticking it out. We cannot be the first to give up, that would be unacceptable!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gobua was reminded of the three proud demon girls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They hated to lose, and even though they were newcomers, they were still a part of the&ldquo;Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords,&rdquo; which was the highest position. To Gobua and the others, they were unimaginably strong, but when their opponent was Velgrynd, the feeling of despair grew stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was amazing that the battle was still going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t lose&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Gobua thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon regaining her spirit, she redoubled her efforts and resumed the capture of Teare.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

It was Agera, who seemed to be a samurai dressed in a casual kimono.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go ahead, Agera! I&rsquo;ll stay out of your way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, Esprit began to heal Gazel and Hakurou. Agera shook his head in disbelief. Esprit was always like that. She conveniently always took the best part. To put it simply, Esprit saw that she could not beat Kondou this time and ran away from the battle. That was Esprit, a demoness who knew how to swim with the tide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera, unconcerned as he always was, pointed his sword at Kondou. He had been undefeated with a single sword for three hundred years. Before Kondou, who had defeated great swordsmen like Hakurou and Gazel, he could feel his blood boiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kondou, was it? You are a skilled swordsman. I, too, live by the way of the sword. I&rsquo;d love to have a sword fight with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera knew he couldn&rsquo;t defeat Kondou without restrictions. It was only because Kondou had agreed to fight with a sword that Hakurou had succeeded to fight back. Otherwise, even if Gazel and Hakurou had challenged him at the same time, they would have been kicked to the ground too quickly to inflict even a single wound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the reason for his proposal. It was a tenuous negotiation, but Agera was confident that Kondou would accept. The reason for this was that Kondou&rsquo;s swordsmanship was somehow familiar to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Agera-dono&hellip;is it true that you, too, are a swordsman, like I suspected?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Kondou could answer, Hakurou interrupted with a question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm? What do you mean b</span><span class="c1 c17">y &lsquo;suspected</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no&hellip; Actually, I thought that Agera-dono looks like someone I used to know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou stammered in response to Agera&rsquo;s curious look. In fact, Hakurou&rsquo;s grandfather and Agera looked so much alike that they were almost identical. Not only their faces, but also their stature, mannerisms, and even their impeccable behavior was similar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that so? But unfortunately, I&rsquo;m afraid I am not the same person. I do not remember meeting you since I was born three hundred years ago. And I do not know if I am a good swordsman, but I am prepared to fight with this sword for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that said, Agera smiled gently. For him, the sword was everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; Well, please forget the trivial thing that I said.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou swallowed his various thoughts and withdrew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera must be the reincarnation of his grandfather&mdash;he suspected that much, but he had no proof. Besides, even if Agera was Byakuya Araki, it wasn&rsquo;t a reason for Kondou to change his mind. The grandfather whom Hakurou hadn&rsquo;t beaten even once was a human, after all. Whatever the answer, it would not be a factor to turn the situation around in the end. The only way to win this battle was to defeat Kondou by force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The person Hakurou-dono knows, by any chance&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s my grandfather.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou replied in a whisper to Gazel, who was also whispering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit joined them in their whispered conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, did Hakurou-san&rsquo;s grandfather die three hundred years ago?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s possible. He was born a demon in that form, and he had a sword from the very start. Besides, &ldquo;souls&rdquo; who are skilled in martial arts gather under Carrera-sama. It wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if there was such a connection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. If that is the case, then does it mean he knows some secrets that even Hakurou-dono does not know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say. I couldn&rsquo;t master it, but of all the techniques he showed me, he said the Hakkasen was the best&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so the conversation went on.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hakurou and the others had already been defeated after giving it their all. Therefore, they were ready to wait and see how they would win or lose. Hakurou was worried about Agera&rsquo;s identity, even though he knew that this was not the right time. And Gazel was also curious about Hakurou&rsquo;s master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit went to treat them. Her appeal to the public that she was doing her job was quite impressive to the point that Agera would tip his hat to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera gave a deep sigh at the situation. Kondou did not interfere with the conversation enemies and was watching Agera with a relaxed attitude. Kondou&rsquo;s role was to eliminate those who would try to interfere with Kagali&rsquo;s ritual. He was also screening out the strongest people who might be useful, not trying to kill all of his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why he decided to respond to Agera without any haste. The only reason he was serious with Gazel was because it was too dangerous to leave him alone. If Hakurou had entrusted a technique to a &lsquo;Saint,&rsquo; who was evenly matched with him, there was no guarantee that he would win. Therefore, Kondou prioritized victory, that is, he prioritized his work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was willing to play around a little if it was against a clearly inferior opponent like Agera. However, it was rare for Kondou to make such a decision. This was because Kondou, who was a pragmatist and a workaholic, disliked waste to the extreme. Kondou&rsquo;s only weakness was his pride in the school of swordsmanship he had studied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Goodness, I&rsquo;m still a little naive that I cannot let go of my personal feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He reflected on this but could not suppress his curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll play along,&rsquo; Kondou was about to say, but he was not so foolish as to lose sight of his surroundings. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Velgrynd move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali&rsquo;s taboo ritual, &lsquo;Birthday,&rsquo; was still in progress, but it looked like the situation had changed. Unfortunately, there was no time, and Kondou decided to move out as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry. I would have liked to keep you company, but work comes first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After speaking to Agera, he put away his sword. His attitude was completely condescending to Agera. But even knowing this, Agera could not stop Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he watched Kondou walk away, he couldn&rsquo;t help but break out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It looks like I narrowly escaped death,&rdquo; he muttered in frustration.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

But that didn&rsquo;t mean he was actually fighting. Such an attempt would have shattered even the technologically advanced Demon Colossus with a single blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra knew his place and would not have done such a foolish thing. He was questioning Velgrynd out of his own curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I had no idea that Her Excellency the Marshal was the sister of Veldora-sama, the Scorch Dragon Velgrynd-sama. I never knew that until now. It&rsquo;s no wonder you&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First was a word of flattery. In this way, he attracted Velgrynd&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only recently that I showed my face, so it&rsquo;s only natural that you didn&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was the end of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd stayed and continued to converse with Gadra. It was his best strategy to buy time with conversation. It worked, and Gadra was still alive even now. However, Velgrynd had her own agenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Oh, I see. So Velgrynd-sama has been supporting His Majesty Rudra all this time. I, Gadra, am truly impressed that you&rsquo;ve been able to play the role of Marshal for generations!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was a time when I didn&rsquo;t speak for a few hundred years. It&rsquo;s not so hard to play the role.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd responded politely, but her face showed signs of fatigue. She was fed up with all the questions Gadra was asking her. That&rsquo;s why she couldn&rsquo;t help saying something that sounded like a complaint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so, you&rsquo;ve got a lot of nerves. I allowed you to ask questions because you&rsquo;re Rudra&rsquo;s favorite, but I didn&rsquo;t expect you to keep asking so many.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered by the compliment!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a compliment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd looked dumbfounded. It would be easy for her to twist and crush Gadra. However, she had already taken out four Split Bodies, and was hesitant to release them just to take out Gadra. As long as he did not interfere with the ritual, she was fine with that and could deal with Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In contrast to Velgrynd, who was wondering if she had made a mistake, Gadra asked a series of lively questions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, I was wondering, why did Damrada-dono stop me from informing His Majesty? If Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s forces had been properly disclosed, the Imperial Army would have suffered less damage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, as you&rsquo;ve probably figured out by now, we don&rsquo;t care about the Imperial Guards. We just let the war happen to awaken the stronger ones.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so, wouldn&rsquo;t it have been better to hear the story from me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How persistent. I know you want to say Damrada has betrayed us, but he has his own reasons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I see. So, what do these reasons have to do with the boy Masayuki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Why would I need to know what Damrada is up to? Who&rsquo;s Masayuki, anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was puzzled by Velgrynd&rsquo;s reaction. By his estimation, Masayuki was the key.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t suppose you know the Hero Masayuki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra asked fearfully to which Velgrynd replied without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you I don&rsquo;t know him, or is he someone strong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When asked if he was strong, Gadra could only say no. Gadra did not dislike Masayuki, and was even fond of him, but he knew that the boy was not strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing Gadra&rsquo;s reply, Velgrynd snickered. &ldquo;Kondou is only interested in those who are likely to awaken. Besides, if you call yourself a Hero, there will always be causal effects, so you would think the demon lords would come to you and take care of you anyway, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; Gadra thought. Yuuki used Masayuki to see Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s reaction. And it was undoubtedly at Damrada&rsquo;s suggestion. In other words, the upper echelons of the Empire must have known about Masayuki. And yet, Velgrynd was saying that she didn&rsquo;t know. Certainly, it would be understandable if she ignored him because he was not a powerful person. At least for Kondou, he would have judged Masayuki to be worthless. He would have tried to nip any uncertainty in the bud, and if Masayuki was the spitting image of Emperor Rudra, it would not be surprising that he would have tried to get rid of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could understand Kondou&rsquo;s thinking, but what he could not understand was Damrada&rsquo;s actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. But Damrada-dono had two Single Digit guards to protect the boy, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To infiltrate the land of monsters, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true, but&hellip;&rdquo; Feeling frustrated, Gadra trailed off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It sounded reasonable somehow, but there was something off about it. From Gadra&rsquo;s point of view, as someone who had betrayed the Empire, he was worried about something that he should not need to worry about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra wanted to yell at Velgrynd to take him more seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem quite dissatisfied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, no, no, no. It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra tried desperately to calm his shaken heart, wondering how she could detect his state of mind when she couldn&rsquo;t even see his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he suddenly understood the reason why he felt at odds with Velgrynd&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damrada-dono is really a traitor, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Master Gadra blurted out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. You&rsquo;re the traitor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a fair point. But Gadra was not daunted. Making the most of his nerves, he spoke up against Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In any case, let me ask you something. This boy, Masayuki, is actually the spitting image of His Majesty Rudra. What do you think about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, it was Masayuki&rsquo;s appearance that made him feel uncomfortable. Whether one was strong or weak, it was natural that the empire placed importance on that. In the case of Masayuki, the more important information, which should have not been left unshared, was that he was the spitting image of the ruler, Emperor Rudra. It was possible that Kondou knew this information. However, Bernie and Jiwu would not have known.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada, Rudra&rsquo;s friend, knew about it. So why did he decide to protect Masayuki? That is what he couldn&rsquo;t understand, Gadra thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said, His Majesty Rudra and the Hero Masayuki have the same face. Why would this information&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the middle of his explanation, Gadra paled and closed his mouth. He shuddered at Velgrynd&rsquo;s expression and, regretting that he had gotten carried away, couldn&rsquo;t help thinking, </span><span class="c1 c2">Oh, perhaps I&rsquo;m going to die&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Velgrynd ignored Gadra and began to ponder. It was unlikely that Kondou was unaware of this information. If so, then she wondered why he didn&rsquo;t tell her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more problematic issue was Damrada. She didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking and could no longer ignore Gadra&rsquo;s words. More than that, to what extent were they similar&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">How similar is he to Rudra? I&rsquo;ll have to confirm it myself&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had thought everything was going according to plan, despite the minor mistake regarding the invading Imperial forces being annihilated. And yet, that seemingly insignificant piece of information irked Velgrynd to no end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gadra, thank you for the useful information. I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook for that information, so what do you say? Do you want to challenge me with that toy of yours?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd had no intention of killing Gadra in the first place. For all appearances, Gadra was one of the few friends Rudra trusted. And while it was true that Gadra had betrayed the Empire, Velgrynd believed that he did not betray Rudra. To Velgrynd, the Empire itself was of no importance. Therefore, Gadra&rsquo;s betrayal was still acceptable to her. In this respect, Velgrynd&rsquo;s thought process was a little different from others and was not something Gadra could guess. That is why he decided that he had no choice but to go along with Velgrynd&rsquo;s proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because he could not win anyway, he chose to argue to buy time. If they were to have a real battle here, the mission would be over at that point. To put it simply, Gadra would be eliminated in less than a second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Gadra did not hesitate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whahahahaha, you&rsquo;ve got to be joking. I&rsquo;m well aware that I&rsquo;m no match for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He needed to be shameless here, and so he just laughed it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this answer, he pretended to be denying the proposal, yet he did not answer either yes or no. He left the decision to his opponent, so there was no fear that he would be accused of running away from Rimuru&rsquo;s side later. It was the perfect way to get by. This was Gadra&rsquo;s cleverness at its finest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was aware of Gadra&rsquo;s craftiness, but all she could think of was that he was a funny guy. She let out a sigh and let it slide as something that was all too typical of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, luckily for Gadra, things had changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; that was fighting Veldora had gotten serious, and it became necessary to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, really? Let me know when you&rsquo;re ready. I&rsquo;ll deal with you then. But before that, do your best to survive this war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have some business to attend to, so I&rsquo;ve decided to leave this to another pawn. You seem to have been hated by the military, so do your best to become a &lsquo;Saint.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean by&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd hovered in the air, ignoring Gadra&rsquo;s attempt to question her. The interruption to the magic would cause a significant delay to the ritual, but it was unavoidable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra, who was left behind, looked up at Velgrynd, stunned. He was confused by the change in the situation and was at a loss as to what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the battlefield, there was no time to relax your mind, not even for a moment. As if to prove this, the meaning of Velgrynd&rsquo;s words became clear even before Gadra could give an answer&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spacetime Connection!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;It was an astonishingly unrealistic scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Velgrynd, who was floating in midair, shouted, the space became greatly distorted. And from there, countless flying ships appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That, is that the fleet of flying ships responsible for carrying the Magic Beast Corps?! N-no way&hellip;are you saying that she connected the space? No, no, no, that&rsquo;s impossible. How far is it from here&mdash;no, no, that&rsquo;s not even the point!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was confused. The reality of what was happening before his eyes was just that unbelievable. The flying fleet that was supposed to attack the Kingdom of Ingracia from the north had been summoned, ignoring both time and space. Even by Rimuru&rsquo;s calculations, it should have taken them more than three days, and Gadra believed it to be impossible to summon them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magical transference was fraught with great danger, and if done poorly, it could kill the soldiers. To prevent this, a larger amount of mana would be needed, and the technique would become more complicated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">No, it is possible for Rimuru-sama. However, if you want to call someone who is at a different coordinate, the difficulty rises by an order of magnitude! This kind of thing should be impossible, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was just too insane. Gadra could see the correct answer, but he could not accept it as reality.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

A fleet of airships heading north to the Kingdom of Ingracia were enjoying a smooth flight. Unlike the dangerous sea route, the sky was safe. This was because there were few, if any, monsters that could fly to high altitudes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In command of the 300 flying ships was Major General Zamud, the chief executive officer. Zamud&rsquo;s mission was to transport allied troops. He was to transport 30,000 members of the Magic Beast Corps, led by General Gladium, to the Central Continent. Since they were not fighting themselves, it was easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was one section of the luxurious flagship where Zamud was boarding that was wrapped in a strange atmosphere. He had been told that an important person was inspecting, but he had not been told who it was. It was a sudden interruption, and at worst, it&rsquo;s possible that Army Commander Calgurio might not even know about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nevertheless, Zamud did not care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Fufufu, it&rsquo;s better not to know. It&rsquo;ll only shorten my life if I pry too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was completely focused on his work. That&rsquo;s why he was able to spend his time relaxing, but then Zamud received an urgent message.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the officer acting as the messenger who came into the bridge with an uncanny appearance. The fact that he had come by himself instead of leaving it to the soldiers meant that he had something important to report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud grinned and asked the officer, &ldquo;What happened? Did you receive a call from our home country?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, they had already received reports that the Army Commander Calgurio had suffered a crushing defeat. Most of the ground forces had been lost, but that was none of Zamud&rsquo;s business. Once an operation was underway, it could not be stopped until it was ordered to be aborted. As the battlefield was still a few days away from here, there was no point in Zamud panicking. In fact, he was even hoping that the order to abort the mission would be issued soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had not informed the soldiers, but if word got out, it would affect their morale, and the success rate of the operation would drop, and he believed it would be safer to start over. Zamud could not make this decision on his own because some people would consider it a weakness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">General Gladium, the general of the allied forces, was such a type of person, and someone Zamud was not very good with. Therefore, Zamud hoped that the report would be an order to abort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, a situation that Zamud could never have imagined occurred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Her Excellency, the Marshal, is here!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-what?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud couldn&rsquo;t help but scream back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Considering that he didn&rsquo;t even know she was on board, Zamud&rsquo;s surprise was not strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">S-so the important person was Her Excellency the Marshal! No way&hellip; Are you saying this mission was that important?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, it was definitely important. However, because one of the three major armies was moving, there should have been no need for the Marshal. No, right now, the first thing to do was to think about how to deal with the Marshal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All rise! We shall welcome Her Excellency!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud, who had recovered quickly, gave the order. The sluggish air was blown away, and the bridge became tense. Immediately after everyone had stood up and bowed, the door was opened. Velgrynd, the stunning beauty, appeared. The people on the bridge were in awe at the sight of Velgrynd&rsquo;s beauty. The Marshal, who had never appeared before, was now standing in front of them. Velgrynd&rsquo;s beauty had captivated them before their brains could even register the fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd, on the other hand, took it as a matter of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Foolish ones. Don&rsquo;t just stand there, get back to work,&rdquo; she pointed out gently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she mustn&rsquo;t get careless. Velgrynd was a rational being and understood that if she rampaged here, she would destroy the flagship. This was Velgrynd&rsquo;s concern, as the main body of Emperor Rudra was on board. The people who were present were lucky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be seated! Everyone, get back to work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following Zamud&rsquo;s orders, the officers returned to their work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, the elegant cruise had come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What followed was a series of surprises for Zamud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great honor to meet you. My name is Zamud. I hope to leave a lasting impression.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll consider it if you survive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is a great honor. I will remember those words and work hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As much as I&rsquo;d like to encourage you, there&rsquo;s no time. Let&rsquo;s get down to business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd brushed aside Zamud&rsquo;s sycophancy and sat down in the captain&rsquo;s chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to Zamud, who stood beside her in a panic, and gave him an order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered to explain things more than once, so call Commander Gladium.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud signaled with his eyes, and the officer who understood his intention connected the monitor to the ship Gladium was on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In less than a few minutes, Gladium appeared on the screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, you are even more beautiful than I imagined.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium looked at Velgrynd and thought it would be easy to subdue her. So there was some doubt in his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Why? Why is a woman like her considered to be stronger than me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her body is supple and soft, with no excess fat or muscle. No matter how one looked at it, she seemed to have nothing to do with strength. Some people thought that the important thing was mana or fighting aura, but one still needed a strong body to circulate those energies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Just like mine</span><span class="c1">, Gladium was proud of his own body. That&rsquo;s why Velgrynd looked so weak to him. He was the essence of muscle-brain functioning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Velgrynd, she didn&rsquo;t think anything of Gladium. His strength was real, and she intended to use him to the fullest as a useful pawn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd simply returned the words, &ldquo;Enough with the flattery,&rdquo; and then gave her orders without hesitation. Velgrynd&rsquo;s attitude was as if she did not care about Gladium at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As of this moment, the operation in progress is canceled. The new mission is to conquer the Armed Nation of Dwargon. That is all. Are there any questions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud and Gladium thought to themselves &lsquo;is it finally time?&rsquo; They had expected the order to be delayed this long because of the unprecedented turmoil in their homeland. If they had suffered a major defeat, it was necessary to review their operations immediately. Since they were conducting a three-front operation simultaneously, that decision would be of even greater importance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A single failure could cause everything to collapse. However, several days later, they were ordered to call everything off, just before arriving at the Kingdom of Ingracia. The two were understandably dismayed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood. Then let us return at maximum speed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hmph! If that is Your Excellency&rsquo;s order, then I, Gladium, will answer with my life. However, please understand that we will hold you accountable later for your late decision and the failure of the mission.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud tensed, but Gladium responded with arrogance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium, who was on a different ship, was unaware of Velgrynd&rsquo;s commanding aura because he was looking through the screen. Zamud watched Gladium&rsquo;s response with deep apprehension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Don&rsquo;t drag me into this!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud prayed internally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd, however, was having none of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;ve got it all wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiled and began to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A misunderstanding, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;About what? Are you saying that you&rsquo;re not at fault?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Yes</span><span class="c1">, nodded Velgrynd, then she began to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;First, Zamud. I will take you from here to your destination. After that, I will continue to give you instructions, so keep that in mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Secondly, Gladium. The mission hasn&rsquo;t failed, and this is exactly what we planned to do from the start.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish! At this point, do you really think you can escape responsibility like that?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Foolish?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd narrowed her eyes in displeasure and glared at Gladium. </span><span class="c1 c2">What a pain</span><span class="c1">, she thought, and wondered what to do about him. She concluded to just leave it be. Gladium was indeed strong, but he was no match for Velgrynd. He could easily be destroyed, but it seemed a shame to do so. And above all, there was no time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This turned out to be a tremendous stroke of luck for Gladium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, whatever. If you survive, we can talk about this at length.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What are you&mdash;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen. I&rsquo;m about to make a &lsquo;Spacetime Connection,&rsquo; so move quickly. After that, I&rsquo;ll focus on Veldora. That kid&rsquo;s a lot tougher than I thought. It&rsquo;s a nice miscalculation, but it&rsquo;s going to be a bit of a handful. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll take over for me and take control of the battlefield. We&rsquo;ve identified several promising candidates, so take them in alive if you can. Understood?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring Gladium, who was still about to complain, Velgrynd got down to business. Having said all that, Velgrynd turned her back on them. Then, she put her hand on the reinforced door to get from the bridge to the outer deck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your Excellency! Your Excellency Marshal, what are you doing? It&rsquo;s not safe, please come back!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? I told you already. If I don&rsquo;t go outside, I can&rsquo;t make a &lsquo;Spacetime Connection.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd glanced at Zamud as if he was a fool and opened the door without hesitation. And just like that, she flew into the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">How selfish! Are you going to drag us into this?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud was terrified. Opening the door while flying at high altitude and high speed was an unbelievably dangerous act. If they got unlucky, the people inside the ship could be sucked out by the difference in air pressure. Zamud, something of a scientist himself, was an ordinary person and not a soldier who had undergone the augmentation operation. The low temperature would deprive him of his physical strength, and he might die of oxygen deprivation. The same was true for the mages under his command.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zamud was impatient to close the door quickly. But his fears were unfounded. Velgrynd had performed a &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; and prevented it from affecting the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not long after his surprise from that, the biggest shock of all hit Zamud&mdash;no, not just Zamud, but all of the officers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a flash, Velgrynd floated into the sky. And the next moment:</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spacetime Connection!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A huge distortion of space appeared before Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is absurd&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. Spatial oscillation confirmed. It seems that the huge, overpowered magicule fluctuation is affecting space-time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;N-no&hellip;could that be the work of Her Excellency the Marshal&hellip;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was indeed absurd. After all, it was a phenomenon beyond human comprehension and beyond human imagination. There was no way to understand what was going on, there was no way anyone could do something like that&mdash;everybody was escaping from reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, Zamud noticed something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;That kid&rsquo;&hellip;? Did the Marshal just call Veldora &lsquo;that kid&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were only a few people he could think of who could call Veldora that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Could it be?! Then this person&rsquo;s true identity&hellip;I&rsquo;m afraid to say&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The guardian dragon of the Empire, a dragon too sacred to even name. Zamud had thought that the Empire was protected by its whims, but now he realized that the truth was something else entirely. As if to confirm Zamud&rsquo;s prediction, Velgrynd&rsquo;s smile deepened in the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, go quickly and be of use to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one would be able to disobey that voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only Zamud, but even Gladium, as if lured by the sweet voice, turned the bow of the airship and headed for the spacetime rift.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The same was true for the three demon girls who were still fighting fiercely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A serious Velgrynd was an unimaginable tyrant. There was no chance against her. With her overwhelming strength, she toyed with the three ladies, not even allowing them to touch her. She was serious and not holding back. Even a mere blow of magic was incredibly powerful. In an attempt to annihilate the three, Velgrynd continued to attack with all the strength she had. She was like a berserker without reason. There was no doubt that this was definitely Velgrynd&rsquo;s full power, without transforming to her dragon form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Testarossa and the others were still alive. If it was before they had been named by Rimuru, they would have lost their bodies and been sent back to the demon world. However, the orichalcum body made by Rimuru had been strengthened by their primordial mana.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, they were able to withstand Velgrynd&rsquo;s rampage, albeit barely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really surprised. I was going to finish this much sooner. You&rsquo;re tougher than I thought, and used to close combat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were Velgrynd&rsquo;s true feelings. She hadn&rsquo;t expected this to take so long even when she was using her full strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ufufufu, we will not be defeated,&rdquo; Testarossa assured her. &ldquo;Diablo would ridicule us if we behaved so disgracefully. That would be more humiliating than death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree. That guy is so malicious,&rdquo; Ultima added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Diablo would say you are the last person he wants to hear that from. Well, but I do agree that he&rsquo;s malicious,&rdquo; Carrera said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite being on the ground and with wounds all over their bodies, the three girls&rsquo; eyes were not resigned. On the contrary, they were still smiling fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their attitude exemplified the concept that as long as you didn&rsquo;t concede defeat, you were not defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh dear, how troublesome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd couldn&rsquo;t help but feel confused, but the battle was already decisive. The troublesome Demon Lord Rimuru and his officers had been captured in the Fortress of Dreams, and Veldora had been successfully dragged out of the labyrinth. The only thing left to do was to take control of Veldora as planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With this in mind, Velgrynd turned a deaf ear to the light-hearted talk of the three demon girls, but when Testarossa stood up and said something, her expression became distorted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It took a while, but I&rsquo;ve figured out the characteristics of this &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their goal was not to defeat Velgrynd, but to stop her here. That was the tactical victory condition, but it was made impossible by Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; subterfuge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why Testarossa had been looking for a way to at least break it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it, shall we?&rdquo; Velgrynd said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa smiled graciously even though she was being beaten up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd thought that Testarossa&rsquo;s attitude was admirable, even though she was an enemy. That&rsquo;s why she was willing to listen to her. Testarossa pointed out that Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; was not invincible but had its limits. There was a limit to the number of Split Bodies she could produce, and if they were defeated, she would not be left unharmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be precise, the physical damage would be zero, I suppose. But for spiritual lifeforms like us, energy consumption is the damage. In other words&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Our attacks were not in vain!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima concluded, taking away Testarossa&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa nodded, smiling. However, her eyes were not smiling, they were looking at Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd sighed inwardly. This was why she didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the Primordials, she thought. Testarossa had hit the nail on the head. In such a short time, and in the midst of being hopelessly overrun, Testarossa was able to analyze the situation. Even Velgrynd had to admit that it was an astonishing sense of combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As expected of Blanc&mdash;no, it was Testarossa. You&rsquo;re correct, I will give you that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;d love to take them for herself without killing them, Velgrynd thought. Resentment served no use, because even if she killed them, they would be revived someday. They might not be like a certain demon lord she knew, but Velgrynd found it extremely troublesome to be stuck with a primordial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera, unaware of Velgrynd&rsquo;s feelings, laughed fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku, you&rsquo;ve shown too much leeway, Velgrynd-sama. Veldora-sama would not be </span><span class="c1 c2">sandbagging</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;against us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was annoyed by Carrera&rsquo;s comment. Incidentally, what Carrera meant by &ldquo;sandbagging&rdquo; was &ldquo;looking down on your opponent and cutting corners.&rdquo; Naturally, Veldora was well aware of the danger of Testarossa and the others. In order to maintain his dignity, he would never show his weaknesses. It turned out to be misunderstood in a good way, but Velgrynd was not amused when she heard Carrera&rsquo;s comment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, she should not be amused. And yet, Velgrynd found herself feeling happy for some reason. As an older sister, she was pleased with the growth of her little brother, who had always been a troublesome child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps because of this, she lost her fighting spirit. It was just the right time, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After fighting with Veldora, she realized that his strength was not what it used to be. Velgrynd was going to get hurt if she didn&rsquo;t give her all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After careful consideration, Velgrynd decided to stop the battle at this point. She decided to let go of Testarossa and the others whom she could kill in an instant if she really wanted to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Indeed, he seems to have grown up quite a bit. I&rsquo;m happy to see that, but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t go easy on him. Therefore, I&rsquo;ve decided to leave you guys here for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd unilaterally proclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; disappeared before the surprised three demon girls. It was only for a moment, and all they could do was watch.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Velgrynd extinguished the Split Bodies she had released all over the place and united them. Then, after emitting a dazzling red light, she transformed into her Dragon Mode cloaked in a crimson aura. In the aftermath, the trees had gone up in flames.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora had also reverted to his dragon form, and his dominating aura had caused a storm to rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The flames flickered, casting light upon Veldora and Velgrynd. The battle between them was now in full swing&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd returned to her true form for the first time in a long time and looked at Veldora. Veldora also exposed his massive frame as if to show off his enormous magicule pool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been a long time since the two siblings had seen one another in these forms. The encounter between Velgrynd and Emperor Rudra had taken place a long time ago. By the time Veldora was rampaging across the land, Velgrynd was already lurking in the empire. She had never left Rudra&rsquo;s side, not even to casually go outside. It was due to this feeling of inconvenience that she had devised the &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; ability, which she only learned after Veldora had been sealed away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last time they had met was on a continent to the southwest over 2,000 years ago. At that time, as she recalled, Velgrynd had only shown a glimpse of her power for fun, and Veldora had fled immediately. But the impact had still been enormous. The energy generated by the collision of the True Dragons had even created a volcanic zone. It is said that volcanoes were still active on that continent to this day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Hmm&hellip;It seems that the seal did not weaken him after all. On the contrary, he seems to have grown stronger than ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Truly, Velgrynd thought it was a happy miscalculation indeed. Her brother&rsquo;s growth was honestly gratifying. The problem was that he would disobey Velgrynd, but that was something that could be solved with strength. Even if she failed, Rudra&rsquo;s power could still be relied on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">As long as Rudra&rsquo;s power is at his disposal, he can control even the True Dragons. As proof of that, even I&hellip;I was&hellip;eh? Just now, what was I thinking about&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd felt as if she was on the verge of remembering something very important, but her thoughts suddenly wandered wildly. Instead, she changed her mindset and decided that her first priority would be to capture Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While she wanted to avoid relying on Rudra as much as possible, she still needed to take away Veldora&rsquo;s resistance in case that did happen. To lighten Rudra&rsquo;s burden as much as possible, even if only a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Rudra is already at his limit, so I need to make things easier for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those were Velgrynd&rsquo;s true feelings. Therefore, as much as possible, she wanted to tame Veldora without relying on Rudra. There was no other reason. There should be no other reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd had a chance to win. The amount of magicules Veldora possessed was vast, but he lacked the ability to properly utilize them. That was why Velgrynd did not consider Veldora to be that dangerous. She thought that his earlier attack was brilliant, but it was only because he was in control of his power that he was able to fight her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Veldora were to use his full strength, he would not be able to control his power well and would only be able to attack with brute force. No matter how massive one&rsquo;s power was, it was meaningless if they could not use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I&rsquo;ll have to teach him a few things once he joins us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he was still a trump card in the game, Velgrynd intended to train Veldora to the point where he could compete with Velzard. But for now, she was going to take advantage of Veldora&rsquo;s inexperience and end this battle at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">This will shift the game board in one breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The end of the long-running game was near. The victory of Velgrynd and Emperor Rudra felt close at hand. The first step was to capture Veldora. With Veldora&rsquo;s cooperation, they would then have a chance to win the game. They would finish the long game in one fell swoop. And then, Rudra would be free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that in mind, Velgrynd slowly began her flight towards Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle was supernaturally fierce from the very first move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was the first to make a move. Without being wary of a counterattack, she unleashed &lsquo;Burning Breath.&rsquo; The ray of light extending from the dragon&rsquo;s mouth was a thin, converging, ultra-high temperature heat ray. Its intense power attacked Veldora at a nightmarish speed, several dozen times the speed of sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora avoided it. Normally, Veldora would not take damage from the flames due to his &lsquo;Heat Nullification.&rsquo; Yet Veldora rushed to avoid the heat ray.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d choose to avoid that one. You&rsquo;re an idiot, that&rsquo;s why I thought I would be able to end it in one move like the old days. You have finally become able to see the true nature of a technique.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! Sister&rsquo;s breath attack has an &lsquo;Accelerated Destruction&rsquo; effect, doesn&rsquo;t it? If I take a direct hit, my mana will go haywire. If that happens, I&rsquo;d lose the power to control it. It&rsquo;s only natural to avoid it,&rdquo; Veldora replied with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, Velgrynd&rsquo;s attack had a special effect. It was the ultimate power of &lsquo;Accelerated Destruction.&rsquo; Due to this power, which could speed up all events, could increase a destructive effect. Not only that, but it also accelerated the life activity of the target. Even spiritual life forms could not resist this power. Even if one could avoid simple destruction, their energy would spiral out of control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora sensed this intuitively and chose to evade it. This was also proved by the result of &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; by Veldora&rsquo;s Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo;. That is why Veldora answered his sister Velgrynd with confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t know you could see that far. I&rsquo;m pleased to see you&rsquo;ve really grown up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora&rsquo;s correct answer gave Velgrynd a sense of crisis. She realized that she was no longer facing a rampaging fool, but an opponent who should be evaluated properly. He saw through her own powers accurately. That meant that Veldora also possessed an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo;s&rsquo; attacks were powerful enough to reach the ultimate level, but when managed along with an Ultimate Skill, the danger level increased astronomically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was delighted. She celebrated the growth of her bungling little brother. But at the same time, she was vigilant. Rudra&rsquo;s plans could fall apart now that Veldora grew to the point where he could threaten her. At this rate, they would not only have difficulty controlling Veldora, but she might even be defeated. She hadn&rsquo;t expected this level of growth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was upset at the thought, and then Veldora made a move against her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you thinking about other things on the battlefield, Sister? That&rsquo;s called being careless!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he said this, he unleashed &lsquo;Thunderstorm&rsquo;. It was Veldora&rsquo;s sure-kill technique, an attack with overlapping storm magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The attack hit Velgrynd directly&mdash;however, the force was scattered and did not cause much damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. It seems that you really have acquired an Ultimate Skill. I commend you from the bottom of my heart, Veldora!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still a terrifying person, Sister. You deliberately took the attack just to confirm it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I have other choices, right? I needed to measure the threat level of your power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, does my Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo; pass?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems to be an analytical type of Ultimate Skill. It doesn&rsquo;t appear to add any extra attack power, but the accuracy correction is excellent. Your mana control has improved thanks to your &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo; ability, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! That&rsquo;s right. My magicule amount is greater than yours, Sister, so there&rsquo;s no need for more power. As long as my attack hits, that&rsquo;s all that matters,&rdquo; Veldora boasted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re smarter than I thought you&rsquo;d be,&rdquo; she replied with a smile. &ldquo;You certainly have something that I do not. That&rsquo;s why I want to add you as a trump card.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm?! When my sister praises me, my back feels all itchy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora replied playfully, but he also noticed that the atmosphere around Velgrynd had changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, you should be rewarded for that. I&rsquo;ll show you just what I am capable of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, there&rsquo;s no need&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will deal with you using the full power of my Ultimate Skill, &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora&rsquo;s voice did not reach Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be outrageous to lose by cutting corners. Even after the fierce exchanges, neither of them had sustained much damage. That is why Velgrynd decided to give her all against Veldora. She was sure that Veldora would not die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A myriad of magic circles appeared around Velgrynd. It was a simultaneous activation of magic by a partial &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eat this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eleven light rays&mdash;Nuclear Attack Magic: Nuclear Canon attacked Veldora. After a moment&rsquo;s judgment, Veldora decided to neutralize the magic with a magic barrier. There were too many rays to evade. Besided, he thought it was just simple magic and planned to just ignore it, which caused him to be a bit late in responding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora had put up a magic barrier because he sensed the danger of Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Nuclear Cannon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gyabaa!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora felt searing pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had failed to neutralize Velgrynd&rsquo;s magic, and he had been hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you really have gotten clever, haven&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m a little surprised that you only took that much damage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gununununu, I didn&rsquo;t think that even magic could be granted the power of an Ultimate Skill as well&hellip; If I had taken it head-on, I would not have been able to escape unscathed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As for me, I was planning to finish you off, so you can be proud of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha, I appreciate the offer, but I&rsquo;m afraid I must decline. I&rsquo;ll be proud of myself once I defeat you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In return, Veldora activated his Storm Magic: &lsquo;Tempest Ruin.&rsquo; He mimicked Velgrynd&rsquo;s move by imbuing his attack with the effect of his Ultimate Skill. The attack succeeded in blowing Velgrynd away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! What do you think, Sister? If you&rsquo;ve learned your lesson, then we can make peace and end this here&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare make a fool out of me! It seems that you&rsquo;ve made me angry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh?! No, wait a&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd snapped, no longer asking questions. Veldora&rsquo;s attack had damaged her. The moment Velgrynd realized that, her sense of reason was blown away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an attempt to regain her pride as an older sister, Velgrynd launched her next attack. Ten heads appeared and unleashed eleven rays of &lsquo;Burning Breath&rsquo; at Veldora. At the same time, she shifted space and positioned herself above Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora, who was avoiding the simultaneous attacks of multiple breath attacks, found himself in a disadvantageous position. He found himself confronting Velgrynd from below, looking upwards. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel impressed with her maneuver. At the same time, it made him happy that he could sense Velgrynd&rsquo;s seriousness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Kuahahaha! I was no match for her in the past, but now I am able to fight like this. This is all thanks to my training with Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was so happy. Despite this, he understood that he was in danger. He thought about how to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd, on the other hand, was pleased to have Veldora in her kill-zone. She was certain that this was the perfect position and that she would not let Veldora escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s end this, Veldora. After all, you cannot escape from my hands!&rdquo; Velgrynd declared, raining &lsquo;Burning Breaths&rsquo; down from above.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The scorching rain poured down incessantly, connecting heaven and earth as a pillar of flame. Seen from the outside, it looked like a cage of flame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the midst of all this, Veldora anxiously danced back and forth. He was not playing around at all and was looking ahead to anticipate every attack, evading each one. It was still a very fast attack, but Veldora felt that it was not so fast that he could be overwhelmed. Trusting his instincts, he sent his massive frame flying. As a result, even though he was surrounded by the flame cage, he did not take a single direct hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! It&rsquo;s nothing if it doesn&rsquo;t hit me!&rdquo; Veldora happily shouted a line he had learned from the scriptures (manga).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd, on the other hand, clicked her tongue in annoyance. It was certainly a miscalculation on Velgrynd&rsquo;s part not to get a single shot. There was no doubt that she had underestimated Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">This is where my attack begins!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her absolute advantage was still intact. Velgrynd decided to show her secret move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is indeed admirable to have seen through my attacks to such an extent. As a reward, I will send you a searing hug! &lsquo;Burning Embrace&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s positioning above Veldora was significant. Below was the earth, boiling with burning lava from the &lsquo;Burning Breath&rsquo; that Veldora had avoided. Even the splattering drops held a terrifying amount of heat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would happen if more attacks were added to that burning hell?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-hold on, Sister?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too late to panic any longer when sensing that intention. Veldora had been caught in Velgrynd&rsquo;s trap from the start. Velgrynd&rsquo;s excessive attack caused the ground to boil and gasify. The super-heated lava enveloped Veldora&rsquo;s surroundings. That is the tiny droplets that contained Velgrynd&rsquo;s power&mdash;&lsquo;Bloody Lava&rsquo;&mdash;pouring from bottom to top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Cardinal Cage&rsquo; used to hold Veldora captive was now complete.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The momentum of the object would increase greatly, and the heat would also be amplified to the maximum. It was no wonder that the &lsquo;Bloody Lava&rsquo; turned to gas, reaching tens of thousands of degrees rather than 2,000 degrees. This was how the scorching prison was created, but its true potential lay beyond that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s support effect could be increased to any extent without limit. In other words, a moderate amount of support will have a positive effect, but an excessive amount will be a burden. The </span><span class="c1 c2">negative</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;effect could even accelerate the exhaustion of the subject&rsquo;s stamina. It was also possible to increase the effect to the point of burning the target to death with the heat its body generated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, the true ability of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo;&mdash;it was the power to manipulate all energies at will.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if embracing Veldora, the red rain created a delicate coating. Those trapped in the &lsquo;Burning Embrace&rsquo; must surrender their right to life and death to Velgrynd. Even if the target was a True Dragon, the result would be the same. Once trapped in the cage, there was no escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was convinced of her victory and was about to make her final offer to Veldora&mdash;but then she paused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no sign of Veldora, whom she should have captured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">What&rsquo;s going on?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was in a rare state of impatience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, she felt a presence behind her and turned around in a panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahahaha! Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that before? It&rsquo;s nothing if it doesn&rsquo;t hit me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trumpeting his victory was the human-form Veldora. His high, loud laughter was extraordinarily piercing to Velgrynd&rsquo;s ears. It was only then that Velgrynd truly recognized Veldora as a threat.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Veldora as well. Although he was laughing confidently, he did not have that much to spare. Veldora had been angry because his clothes had been burned, but once he cooled down, he realized that there was a big difference in ability between him and his sister. He recognized that there was little chance of victory even if he fought seriously, and so he went on the defensive around halfway through their fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the very strategy of Hinata. While taking care not to receive fatal wounds on herself, she would devise attacks based on the gaps in her opponent&rsquo;s defense. Then, when she determined the most effective move, she would unleash a barrage of attacks when she found the right time to strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the battle with Hinata, it seems that she had seen through his own habits. When they fought at the 100th level, he had overwhelmed her with his strength, but once she time-leaped, he was beaten by her in the form of the Hero Chronoa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Well, it&rsquo;s no wonder. Even though it was supposed to be our first fight, she knew all my moves and habits. I knew something was wrong!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was cheating&mdash;Veldora thought so, but saying so would only make him sound like a sore loser. Just remembering Hinata&rsquo;s smug face was annoying, but a loss was still a loss. Veldora honestly reflected on himself and learned how to fight a superior opponent from that experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only that, but he learned cunning through the mock battles with the demons. Even if you couldn&rsquo;t win with your own strength, you could win by being less exhausted than your opponent. That was the type of battle between spiritual beings, and Veldora had learned it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a perspective he had never held before. By observing Rimuru&rsquo;s way of life, an interest in all sorts of things emerged. The naturally inquisitive Veldora&rsquo;s horizons were opened up and he learned to think in ways that he had never done before. This seemed to have a positive effect and played a role in Veldora&rsquo;s growth. This was now being demonstrated in the battle against Velgrynd. Veldora was practicing the art of fighting without losing, wherein Velgrynd activated the &lsquo;Burning Embrace&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Cardinal Cage&rsquo; was a sure-kill technique. Once the target was captured, Velgrynd&rsquo;s victory was assured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora had been too busy avoiding the &lsquo;Burning Breath&rsquo; to see that it was a trap. However, the &lsquo;Predict Danger&rsquo; of his Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo; was activated. He always activated it in order to not be caught off guard in any situation. It worked and saved Veldora from his crisis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After receiving a maximum warning he had never felt before, Veldora knew that something was wrong. He was convinced by the terrifying chill that if he continued to escape, he would lose. However, there was no way to figure out what was going on, even if he rushed to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just then, the &lsquo;Bloody Lava&rsquo; erupted in the air. Seeing this, Veldora saw through Velgrynd&rsquo;s true thoughts. But at that stage, it was still difficult to deal with. It was obvious that this was not something that could be blown away by his &lsquo;Ruin Tempest&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The area was already under the influence of Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo;, and it was impossible to escape with &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Oh crap!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But at that moment, the &lsquo;Investigation of Truth&rsquo; of &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo; came up with the optimal solution. It was dangerous to touch the &lsquo;Bloody Lava,&rsquo; because Velgrynd&rsquo;s will also resided in it. It was not easy to escape from that mist-like substance. However, even if it was impossible for a massive body, it was possible for a human form. Although he would have to give up his defenses, he could see a future where he could escape through that gap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, the chance of success was 50 percent. If he timed it correctly, he would be fine, but if he failed, he would be taken out in one shot. Veldora was in doubt, but then he had a revelation that would definitely lead to success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t realize that the &lsquo;Probability Manipulation&rsquo; of his &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo; had been activated. Surprisingly, the &lsquo;Probability Manipulation&rsquo; was a power that allowed him to manipulate events to his own advantage against opponents of equal or lower rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora was also surprised by this. In other words, the probability of success was doubled. In this case, it was as if his escape, which had only a 50 percent chance of success, was guaranteed to succeed. </span><span class="c1 c2">How convenient was that?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Veldora was skeptical, but he reverted to his human form and attempted to escape from the cage. He succeeded in doing so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, Veldora escaped from his crisis.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

She wondered just when Veldora had grown up so much, when she had initially thought her brother was inferior to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a terrible misunderstanding that he was nothing but a violent brute who let his strength run amok. Veldora had brilliantly mastered an Ultimate Skill, which could rival even Velgrynd. And amazingly, he had managed to escape from a situation that should have been absolutely impossible to reverse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might have been extremely presumptuous of her to try and teach Veldora a lesson. She had no choice but to admit it. Veldora was on the same level as herself. Velgrynd recognized Veldora and confronted him as an equal or greater enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she analyzed the situation calmly, Velgrynd was at a disadvantage. It was because her special move had just been defeated. Superficial attacks would be evaded, and it would be difficult to inflict a fatal wound. In that case, she had no choice but to rely on Rudra&rsquo;s &lsquo;Regalia Dominion&rsquo; after wearing Veldora down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that in mind, Velgrynd decided to change her tactics and act cautiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? It seems my sister has acknowledged me as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps noticing Velgrynd&rsquo;s intention, Veldora returned to his dragon form and spoke casually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd found it amusing even though it should have been irritating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Come to think of it, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever played with this kid before&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was thinking of such things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a smile on her face, Velgrynd replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yes, you&rsquo;re right. I will admit it. You are now able to hold your own. That&rsquo;s why, Veldora, if you&rsquo;re going against me on your own terms, I will not tolerate it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd declared, as if speaking to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing his sister&rsquo;s change of mood, Veldora felt threatened. But he couldn&rsquo;t just nod in acceptance here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! In that case, I will also give it my all to deal with you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora was finally getting used to his Ultimate Skill, which he had not used much until now. He had been having a tough time against his sister, Velgrynd, but with this power, he felt that he could still compete.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, Veldora decided that it was his turn to take action. Although he could not use &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; as Velgrynd had done, Veldora also had a sure-kill technique up his sleeve. The name of the technique, which he told only to Rimuru, was &lsquo;Storm Blast.&rsquo; He had come up with this after consulting with him, and once he learned it, Rimuru had praised him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Even Rimuru was impressed. There&rsquo;s no way it wouldn&rsquo;t work on my sister!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora was very confident. As far as Veldora knew, there was no one more cunning and tricky than Rimuru. He had always thought to himself that he was lucky to have Rimuru as an ally. And this technique had Rimuru&rsquo;s seal of approval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, without hesitation, Veldora unleashed the &lsquo;Storm Blast.&rsquo; From Veldora&rsquo;s mouth, a &lsquo;Thunderstorm&rsquo; was unleashed. Its fury interfered with space, and invisible rays of light flew about haphazardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, Velgrynd would only deal with attacks that were extremely dangerous. To begin with, she did not care about the interference waves as it would have no effect on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was the trap. When multiple types of seemingly meaningless waves crossed with one another, they generated an unexpected destructive force. Similar to sonic weapons, they did not pose a threat on their own, but by the time you noticed them all, it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was no exception, having overlooked the &lsquo;Storm Blast.&rsquo; It was only through the pain that pierced her entire body that he realized she had fallen into Veldora&rsquo;s trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guuhh?! I&rsquo;m feeling pain&hellip;what? Veldora, just now, what did you do?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! It&rsquo;s the special technique I invented. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Storm Blast,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m quite proud of it,&rdquo; Veldora boasted smugly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was elated that he had hit the target. Although he understood that this was not a fatal blow, he had never had such an advantage over his sister before. That was why Veldora couldn&rsquo;t help but want to brag. But:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really are foolish, you know. You still need to improve upon that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora writhed in a fierce pain that he had never felt before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Velgrynd who triumphed. As soon as Velgrynd had acknowledged Veldora, she had given up on the duel. There was no point in winning or losing, and she focused only on the success of the mission. That is why she had secretly brought in the emperor&rsquo;s flagship without Veldora&rsquo;s knowledge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aboard the flagship was Lieutenant Kondou, who was fully prepared. As instructed by Velgrynd with her &lsquo;telepathy&rsquo;, Kondou unleashed his most powerful attack against Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A blow that could destroy even a deity. The bullet, which Kondou could only fire once a day, was called &lsquo;Judgment.&rsquo; This was the ultimate blow, firing the most powerful bullet created by the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo; with his Nambu pistol that had been elevated to the mythical-level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was far more powerful than the &lsquo;Necrosis,&rsquo; and as far as Kondou knew, no one had ever been hit by it and remained unscathed. It was capable of burying even Velgrynd&rsquo;s Split Body, and no matter how great Veldora was, he would not remain unharmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything was as Velgrynd had calculated. The bullet&rsquo;s initial speed was close to the speed of light, and it could penetrate any &lsquo;defense barrier&rsquo; to reach its target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The careless Veldora had no room left to resist the &lsquo;Judgment.&rsquo; He was pierced by the bullet, and even his own existence was jeopardized as a consequence.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Did my sister actually get help from a third party?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora had been overjoyed at the prospect of beating his sister. It seemed that her sister exploited this moment and made him fall for her trick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so, he was surprised that his sister, a prideful woman, had abandoned the duel against him. He understood that she was giving priority to the victory condition, but that was very unlike her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As important as that was, the more problematic issue was his current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Not good! That man&hellip;That must be the guy Rimuru was wary of. It was just one blow, and I can&rsquo;t move!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Veldora&rsquo;s brain, a warning was ringing at full force. It was abnormal for Veldora, a spiritual life form, to feel pain and suffering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most powerful &lsquo;True Dragon&rsquo; race was now in a life crisis. It was understandable that Veldora was anxious in the face of this unbelievable fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it had been a head-on strike, he might have been able to resist the attack even if he could not avoid it. However, now that he had been hit by complete surprise, there was nothing Veldora could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Ouch, this is not good. It&rsquo;s better to just accept the defeat this time and get revenge the next time we meet. Kuahahaha. Now then, I&rsquo;ll contact Rimuru&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite the situation, Veldora had plenty of room to spare. It was because he knew that he and Rimuru were connected by a Soul Corridor and he could be resurrected. As long as Rimuru was alive, Veldora was immortal. Therefore, there was no need to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, things began to take a turn for the worse for Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Regalia Dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had been so focused on Kondou that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed, but there was another man standing on the airship, dressed in luxurious clothes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&hellip;Masayuki? No, it&rsquo;s not. Mm? W-wait a minute! What is this? This is bad, this is really bad!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time he realized what was happening, it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That man&mdash;Emperor Rudra, was about to take over Veldora&rsquo;s mind. The &lsquo;Judgment&rsquo; bullet had made him severely hurt. It was all over for Veldora. However, there was one thing that Veldora couldn&rsquo;t stand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&hellip;It&rsquo;s fine if it&rsquo;s just me. But if this continues, my sworn friend Rimuru will be harmed. That&rsquo;s the only thing I can&rsquo;t forgive!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra&rsquo;s control was more powerful than he had imagined. It was obvious that if he left things as is, it would affect even Rimuru through the Soul Corridor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was unforgivable, Veldora thought. Therefore, he cut off the Soul Corridor of his own volition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-This is fine. I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to you, Rimuru&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With those last words, Veldora&rsquo;s consciousness plunged into darkness.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c30" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c21 c39">Chapter 2</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c13 c21">Unleashed Power</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">It was probably the first time that anger had blown away my reason. When Shion and the others were killed, I had felt a mixture of regret and anger, </span><span class="c1 c21 c5 c17">and was engulfed in guilt.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c21 c5 c17">But since there was hope in sight, I had been able to calm the storm in my </span><span class="c1">heart, keep</span><span class="c1 c21 c5 c17">&nbsp;my cool and take my anger out in productive ways&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this time was different. The pain of having my soul torn apart and the possibility of losing Veldora had completely blown away my sense of reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The odds of success? Who cares? Crush the enemy. That is all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, what should we do? It seems we&rsquo;ve been isolated in a special space, but can we pry it open by force?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t need Benimaru to tell me this, but I sensed that we were trapped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the enemy&rsquo;s goal was to capture Veldora, it was only natural that they would take steps to prevent us from interfering. We were the ones who were too stupid to realize that and fell into the trap.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&hellip;Apologies. I&rsquo;m really sorry.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Strangely enough, even the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; was confused. Perhaps it couldn&rsquo;t believe that it had been played by others and had become less calm than usual. Although it was just a Skill, it was so human-like that it could make me smile&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t have the luxury to think about that right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right now, my emotions were only one color of anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought to myself, &lsquo;Enough with the apologies, let&rsquo;s find a way to get out of here.&rsquo; Then it replied that there was a good grasp of the coordinates and that &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; of this space would soon be completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; was truly capable, after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. We&rsquo;re getting out now, but I&rsquo;m aiming for the enemy leader. Listen up, Veldora has fallen into Rudra&rsquo;s hands. As soon as we arrive with &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo;, we&rsquo;re going to have a battle on our hands, so you&rsquo;d better prepare yourselves,&rdquo; I told them, swallowing my anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want to take things out on my friends. All of this anger should be directed at the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They nodded, and I added one more order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that the mana provided by Veldora is gone, Ramiris will not be able to take much anymore. The cities that have been evacuated into the labyrinth will be thrown out onto the surface, so please focus on their defense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only a matter of time now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The current burden on Ramiris was unimaginable, so we had to go quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, but what about Rimuru-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking Veldora back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That took precedence over anything else. So I told them I&rsquo;d let them handle the rest, and everyone understood without saying a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-hold on a minute! Aren&rsquo;t you guys forgetting the most important thing?! How are we going to get out of here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just when I thought he&rsquo;d gone quiet, Laplace suddenly started complaining. That kind of thing was easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just break through it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd! This is the rumored &lsquo;Fortress of Dreams&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s in another dimension and there&rsquo;s no easy way out. They say it&rsquo;s a place meant for isolating troublesome opponents. That&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He sure knew a thing or two, but I had other plans for now.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice.

Laplace, I&rsquo;ll get you out of here too, after that, it&rsquo;s all you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes?! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying to listen&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was about to say something, but none of that mattered to me right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would quickly rescue Veldora and eliminate the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a state of rage, I activated &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

This kind of transportation without hesitation was sort of an unthinkable act for me. But I didn&rsquo;t care about that right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could see two True Dragons in front of me, and an airship flying behind them. The enemy was directly ahead. All that was left was to go on a rampage. And yet, &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; was annoyingly warning me of the danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s because it was aware of the enemy&rsquo;s strength, but to me, it was just a distraction. Once I&rsquo;ve decided to do something, of course I have to do it to the very end, so there&rsquo;s no point in panicking now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Do something!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I silenced it with an order.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Understood. Optimal action &lsquo;Demon Summoning&rsquo; is recommended.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm, that sounds pretty good. If we didn&rsquo;t have enough combat forces, then just increase them. And on that note, let&rsquo;s finish up the evolution of Testarossa and the others that had been postponed until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I will give it my all here. And then, crush the enemies once and for all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly in surprise as she noticed us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was it the &lsquo;Fortress of Dreams&rsquo; thing? She really seemed to believe that she had blocked our movements with that, but something like that wasn&rsquo;t even a problem with the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo;s&rsquo; calculations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was connected to my companions by a Soul Corridor. If I traced back the connections, it was no problem figuring out my positional coordinates. Even if I was in another dimension, &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; was possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and the others were on alert to protect me and the capital Rimuru that had appeared far behind us. So, rest assured, I would do what I had to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Testarossa, Ultima, Carrera! Can you move?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Rimuru-sama! Of course!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It&rsquo;s fine, there&rsquo;s no problem!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to answer no to a question from Milord.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three different answers came back, and they didn&rsquo;t sound like they were hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was relieved. In that case, I would make a move to free Veldora without hesitation. I used the suggestion from Wisdom King Raphael and would perform Demon Summoning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, someone got in the way. Perhaps judging it to be dangerous, Kondou was the first to move. Normally, bullets would not have been able to reach, but he had fired without regard to the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bullet reached several dozen times the speed of sound. My thoughts accelerated a million times faster than usual grasping the details of that attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Defend me</span><span class="c1">, I thought to myself and Wisdom King Raphael responded with an &lsquo;Understood.&rsquo; Without any problems, the &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; succeeded in nullifying the attack. This attack was nowhere close to the one used on Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice. Barrier destruction effect detected&hellip; Successfully disabled. Continuing, detected an attack that destroys the mind and magic circuits&hellip; Disabled. As a result of &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo;, the attack has been determined to be caused by the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo;. From now on, relevant countermeasures will be begin&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ignored the analysis of &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I glanced at Kondou, Damrada and the others, and decided that they could be dealt with later. The attack they used on Veldora was really threatening, but there must be a reason why they hadn&rsquo;t used it again. Either they didn&rsquo;t use it, or they couldn&rsquo;t use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That attack, which was close to the speed of light, would be impossible to avoid if it got close. But from a long distance, as long as I was not careless, I&rsquo;d be able to deal with it in time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite this situation, Kondou had not moved from his spot. He was probably protecting Rudra, but I figured it was safe to ignore him.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I uttered the words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come forth, demons! Greater Demon Summoning Gate Creation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A huge magic circle appeared in the sky. What emerged was a great gate exuding an ominous aura. It transcended time and space, summoning the demons that were connected to me. The first ones to respond to my call were the three demonesses. Then the two demon peers and the four archdemons appeared, followed by the six hundred demons who were their subordinates. The majority of the Black Numbers had gathered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Rimuru-sama, I have sent my subordinates to defend the city.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s Diablo for you. He knew exactly what I wanted without me saying a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aside from Venom who was Masayuki&rsquo;s escort, we had all the subordinate demons free at our disposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru had also regained the command he had left with Moss and was issuing orders to the entire army. Even though I hadn&rsquo;t said anything, the support system was perfectly in place. That being the case, it was time to finish the ritual quickly before any more obstacles could get in the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as they landed on the ground, the demons knelt down before me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three demonesses were in the front, but they were sullen, perhaps thinking that they had failed to obey my orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;My deepest apologies!&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They apologized as soon as they saw my face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, there is nothing to apologize for. The goal of stalling Velgrynd was accomplished as planned. This time, I am the one responsible for not seeing through her &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; trick.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This kind of thing was unpredictable if it wasn&rsquo;t known about in advance. One can&rsquo;t plan anything if they&rsquo;re afraid of any and all dreamlike powers that might exist. This time there was really nothing we could have done. Besides, the way Testarossa and the others had fought was quite helpful information and definitely not meaningless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As much as I wanted to express my gratitude to them, that would have to wait for later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave strict orders to the demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen well, I will now grant you power. However, you are not allowed to fall asleep. Like Diablo, all of you must endure your evolution on the spot!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought I was saying something crazy. I had never said anything I couldn&rsquo;t do myself before. I, myself, had fallen into an evolutionary slumber when becoming a demon lord due to the Harvest Festival&rsquo;s effect, and now I was ordering the demons under my control to endure it. I didn&rsquo;t think that was right, but now was not the time to think about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who couldn&rsquo;t keep up would be left behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps reading my intentions, the three demon girls smiled fearlessly and waited for me to continue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you do it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As Milord wishes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All three of them had a look of confidence on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave them the &lsquo;Souls&rsquo; without hesitation. I didn&rsquo;t think about what would happen if it failed. If Testarossa and the others went out of control, I could just use that as a diversion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My priorities would not waver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why I offered these words to the demons who had begun to evolve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can go as wild as you want. You can spread as much death and destruction as you like. However, you must not die. </span><span class="c1 c2">Those guys </span><span class="c1">must not get in the way. Until I release Veldora, you will use your bodies as shields to hold the enemy back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While telling them not to die, I ordered them to lay down their lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was so selfish, but that&rsquo;s who I was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What should we do about Veldora-sama&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo; Diablo asked me, but the answer to that question was already settled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. If she interferes, I will handle her. I&rsquo;ll just </span><span class="c1 c2">devour</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Diablo smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not just Diablo, but the others as well. Benimaru smiled fearlessly. While Souei had a sneer on his face. Shion was beginning her warm-ups with a huge smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were all reliable friends.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We shall clear the way for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded to Benimaru&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm.

Go and kill them all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo; &rdquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was good.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I could focus on Veldora without any worry. And so, I turned my gaze to Veldora. Apparently, while I was getting ready, Velgrynd was preparing to intercept. She seemed to have received magicules from Veldora and seemed to have fully recovered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That power of recovery was the true essence of Veldora. It was because of Veldora&rsquo;s enormous amount of magicules that recovery in such a short time was possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, Veldora was hostile to me. Without a doubt, he had become Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s puppet. Velgrynd also seemed determined, and it looked like I would have to deal with two True Dragons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was going to be tough, but I would just have to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I told Diablo, if Velgrynd was going to be my enemy, I would have to eliminate her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait for me, Veldora. I&rsquo;ll release you soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I muttered to myself and spread my wings to fly.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

At the same time, he sent out a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; to the remaining executives in the city, quickly shifting them to an emergency position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei dispatched his &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; to various locations to gather information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Diablo was at the peak of his excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu! Did you see that, everyone? Rimuru-sama is finally going to show his serious side!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion replied to Diablo in astonishment, &ldquo;Fool! No matter what he does Rimuru-sama is always wonderful. We must save our excitement for later and now focus on crushing the enemy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though there was something strange with that statement, Shion&rsquo;s words were correct. It was understandable for them to be surprised as this was the first time they would witness Rimuru going on a rampage, but now was not the time to ponder on it. As Benimaru had declared, the role of the executives was to clear the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, it was an edict from Rimuru. This was gospel for the executives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the demons summoned by Rimuru, this was even more of a supreme pleasure. Their faces were full of joy, and they were filled with energy because now was their time to be of service. It was obvious from their demeanor, how long they had been waiting for this call. As if to prove the depth of Rimuru&rsquo;s anger, their terrible power of destruction was about to be unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The order given was very simple.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kill all the enemies!</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to that order, the demons&rsquo; hearts were set ablaze by their mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;As our lord wishes!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demons, who had nothing to fear, were prepared to throw themselves into battle to serve their lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo&rsquo;s single word stopped them all in their tracks. All the demons simultaneously turned their attention to Diablo. He held up one hand to ease the demons back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Do you all understand? It is Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s command that not a single one of you must die. That is to say, a single one of your deaths would be so unforgivable of a sin that it could not be repaid even if the executives gave their heads.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The demons fell silent as Diablo spoke cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo&rsquo;s smile instilled more fear in them rather than any sense of confidence. Besides, what Diablo had said was true, with no room for rebuttal. The demons quietly waited for the next words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Benimaru who opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Diablo is right. You may think you are immortal, but that kind of sophistry won&rsquo;t be accepted, it is nothing but an excuse in front of Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that they could be resurrected over time was not a good enough reason to die. Benimaru&rsquo;s words corrected the demons&rsquo; misunderstanding. They all realized their mistake and became quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On seeing this, Diablo opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Therefore, it is necessary to decide the division of roles beforehand. Benimaru-dono, could you please make the assignments?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru asked, wondering if Diablo would listen to his instructions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, please leave me out of it. There is a rat that I&rsquo;m curious about, so I&rsquo;m going to deal with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this answer, Benimaru shrugged. He had expected it from the start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;I see. Well, you do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">It&rsquo;s better not to have anything to do with Diablo</span><span class="c1">. That was what Benimaru was thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, Diablo was under the direct control of Rimuru, so even Benimaru had no authority to give him orders. It was just that, this time, Diablo himself had entrusted Benimaru with the task, so Benimaru had acted accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Diablo is free to act as he pleases. Moss, as you have been doing till now, continue sending me information from the battlefield. Spread out throughout the battlefield only in accordance with Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo nodded with a smug smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Moss nodded his head in agreement. Since he had already scattered his clones, he and Benimaru were still connected to the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; in real time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forgive you if you leave me out of this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion spoke in a dignified manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion could also perform &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo;, but only within her field of vision since she was not good at calculating coordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru chuckled and nodded his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m counting on your strength as well. There are eight major entities on that airship, not including Emperor Rudra. They will be a bit difficult to deal with but it&rsquo;s not as unreasonable as Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s chosen opponents. Even without Diablo, we should be able to manage on our own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The battlefield is also troublesome. As many as 30,000 enemy reinforcements are coming in one after the other,&rdquo; Souei advised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Benimaru was already aware of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a race against time. I&rsquo;ve ordered Gabil to stall for time as long as he can, so we have to take the emperor into custody before there are any casualties.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru spoke fearlessly, and Souei and Shion nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as Rimuru wished for it, Benimaru had no choice. He would do everything in his power to make those desires come to fruition, so he drew up what he believed was the best strategy. The plan was to stallor time and take out the most troublesome opponents of the airships. The decision was made on the premise that doing so would, conversely, prevent an attack on their city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, the eight entities that Benimaru was referring to were the &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; that Velgrynd left behind as insurance and the &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; members that had gathered together. The latter included Lieutenant Kondou, Damrada, the four knights guarding the emperor, and the last one was Marco. Now that no one was hiding their presence, Benimaru was able to detect them with his Unique Skill &lsquo;Generalissimo&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this time, Benimaru received good news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;Geld has responded. It seems that he has just completed his evolution and woken up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Barrier Lord&rdquo; Geld had awakened. In response, his men were also beginning to wake up. He said that they would soon be joining the city defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great addition. If Geld-dono is willing to defend the city, we can remove the devil chevaliers from defense duty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will those guys be under my command as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We cannot displace Venom together with them, hence they won&rsquo;t be able to move in a systematic manner. It would be better to let each of them make his own decision based on the circumstances of the battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, with a short exchange between the executives, the roles were decided. All that remained was to believe in victory and take action, but there was still one more thing left to be confirmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, are you guys still able to fight?&rdquo; Benimaru asked Testarossa and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no hesitation in his words. It was only a question to confirm whether they could be counted on as a fighting force or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. There&rsquo;s no need to ask. Needless to say, anyone under my command who answers &lsquo;No&rsquo; is not needed here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo turned his gaze to Testarossa and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not needing to be pressured, Testarossa and the others stood up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a silly question. There&rsquo;s nothing Diablo can do that I cannot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit tough, but I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it either. I like to fight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to make another mistake if I want to live up to His Lordship&rsquo;s expectations. Now is not the time to sit here and rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be of service to Rimuru-sama&mdash;the girls were united in their wills. And so were their subordinates. The demons were rapidly completing their evolution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They now received the long-awaited order with the greatest of joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Testarossa, Ultima, and Carrera had evolved into &lsquo;devil lords&rsquo; like Diablo had. They had become divine demons, one of the strongest beings in the world, capable of defeating even a demon peer without an issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this way, all of the Seven Primordials had become equal in rank, with all restrictions lifted.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Diablo&rsquo;s servant Venom had become a demon peer, Testarossa&rsquo;s servants also received a </span><span class="c1 c2">gift</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the form of evolution. Although Moss and Veyron remained demon peers, their magicule counts had increased to the point where it was comparable to that of an awakened demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other four, Agera, Esprit, Zonda, and Cien, had also become demon peers, surpassing even the Demon Lord Seed. They had evolved into the highest-ranking of demons in both name and substance. These demons were of the same rank, however, there was a clear difference in ability. The differences in their titles directly defined their class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moss had become an archduke, comparable to a king. Veyron became a duke, Agera was a marquis, Esprit was a count, Cien and Zonda were viscounts. As a side note, Venom was recognized as a baron.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among the rest of the demons, several archdemon commanders were born. This was the equivalent to knighthood, where they would then work for many more years to officially be knighted. The remaining almost six hundred demons had become devil chevaliers, rivaling the greater majins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All to become stronger and more useful to Rimuru. The demons had evolved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a single one left out, the demons showed their willingness to join the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. I look forward to your performance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, the three demonesses and their confidants quickly joined the airship assault, but Benimaru had given the order without hesitation, as if he had intended to do so from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, Testarossa-dono. I&rsquo;d like to ask you to clean up the trash. Can you do that?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, of course. That will be easy,&rdquo; she replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Ultima cut in, &ldquo;I want to do it! I can do it too, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response, Benimaru spoke without getting offended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who does it, but I want to keep that airship. We must use it as a battlefield to settle the score with Emperor Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Ultima, I asked Benimaru-dono to assign the duties. If you disagree with this, it means you are going against me. Think about that before you speak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima was fortunate that Diablo was in the best of moods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, what she said would have earned her a punishment from Diablo but it only ended in getting her admonished, since he was in a very good mood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, that&rsquo;s too bad. You&rsquo;re right, this job is not for me. I will follow Benimaru-san&rsquo;s instructions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima had realized immediately that she was in trouble. So she was relieved that the conversation had gone smoothly without a hitch, settling the matter, pretending to agree as if no longer stubborn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima was so innocent that she sometimes made mistakes, but she was surprisingly good at reading the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll continue,&rdquo; said Benimaru, and assigned roles to the remaining members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, Testarossa was tasked to eliminate the knights guarding the emperor&rsquo;s flagship. Following that, the names of those who would participate in the raid were announced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion, Souei, Ultima, and Carrera were the four who were confirmed for the raid. Naturally, Benimaru himself would also join them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Emperor Rudra probably won&rsquo;t make a move. But if he does, all we have to do is crush him. That is why we have to defeat Velgrynd-sama&rsquo;s &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; and the remaining seven &lsquo;Single Digit&rsquo; members.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then it won&rsquo;t be enough if each of us takes care of one of them. Since it can&rsquo;t be helped, I&rsquo;ll handle two of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you want, I can even take out three of them,&rdquo; Shion boasted, but Benimaru calmed her down and continued to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Shion. Although you&rsquo;re correct, it&rsquo;s not good to take work away from those guys,&rdquo; said Benimaru, who turned his attention towards Veyron and the others who had been waiting for instructions with expectant looks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen, carelessness is one&rsquo;s worst enemy. We will attack with our maximum strength, leaving only the necessary numbers. Of course, we&rsquo;ll also have Testarossa-dono join us, would that be all right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing his words, Testarossa smiled lustrously. She had thought it would be an unbearable humiliation to end up on duty sweeping up the small fries. Unlike Ultima, she hadn&rsquo;t said it out loud, but if she had been ordered to stay behind, she would have been frustrated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave a hundred guards to make sure no one escapes from that airship. I want the remaining 500 devil chevaliers to head for Gabil and the others as their reinforcement&hellip; Who will command that force?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I believe Cien would be a good choice. He is familiar with Moss and is good at such chores.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cien looked up when his name was called. His eyes were a little teary as he was happy that Testarossa remembered him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well. Now then, Cien, head over there right away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cien&rsquo;s actions were swift. He left behind a hundred of his men and flew off with the others. Thanks to those reinforcements, Gabil and the others escaped total annihilation.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the plan was set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following Testarossa&rsquo;s preemptive attack, a select group of elites would enter the airship. This would be followed by blockade of the emperor&rsquo;s flagship by a hundred of the top devil chevaliers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, Shion, and Souei were the executives who would rush in. In addition to them, the three &ldquo;devil lords&rdquo; and four demon peers would enter the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Veyron, Agera, Esprit, and Zonda, be thankful for the chance you have been given,&rdquo; Carrera said, but it was her who seemed happier than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Well then, good luck to you all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as the plan was finalized, Diablo gave his salutations with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa was the first to respond, &ldquo;Ufufufufu. Now then, if any of them survive my blessing, make sure you take care of them. Do not let a single one of them escape, understood?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa turned to her subordinates and ordered them to serve as hounds. As for the demons, they didn&rsquo;t need to be told to do so, but none of them said so. Rather&mdash;they wondered if anyone could withstand the attacks of the current Testarossa to begin with. After ordering her subordinates she moved towards her prey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Following that, Benimaru and the others took flight. Not to be left behind, Veyron and the others followed suit. The demons also spread out and finished positioning themselves around a single airship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon, the decisive battle in the sky was about to begin.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least, that&rsquo;s what everyone thought&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima and Carrera were about to make their move when Ultima tilted her head as if suddenly remembering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s Diablo going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Ultima asked, Carrera turned to look at him, as if she, too, was interested to know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo stiffened. However, he didn&rsquo;t panic and answered with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you see, I have other </span><span class="c1 c2">important </span><span class="c1">work to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing that smile, the two of them grew more and more suspicious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who is that &lsquo;rat&rsquo; you were talking about earlier?&rdquo; Carrera asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not something you ladies need to know&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on a minute. Diablo, do you think it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep secrets?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Even Rimuru-sama always says that sharing information is important.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo had no choice but to divulge information after being cornered by that argument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have the noble mission of watching over Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s courageous figure! This is a particularly important task, and I cannot leave it to you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had the audacity to say something so outrageous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was fortunate that Benimaru was not there. Since even he would have been taken aback. However, Ultima and Carrera were not convinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What! I want to see Rimuru-sama in action too!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a minute, let&rsquo;s hear the details. Do you think you can be the only one who gets to enjoy such a role? I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re our boss, that&rsquo;s just too unreasonable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a very natural reaction, Ultima thought. Why didn&rsquo;t she ask this question when Benimaru was around?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera realized that the odds were against them. If Testarossa had been here, it would have been a different story, but with just Ultima and herself, there was no way they could do anything about Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you appear to be dissatisfied, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course we are!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I follow orders too, but I&rsquo;m not convinced.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;I guess it can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; Diablo sighed. &ldquo;So, let me tell you the truth. In fact, there is someone on the enemy side who can manipulate foreign space. I think it&rsquo;s probably Velgrynd-sama, so if you&rsquo;re trapped within it, your connection to this world may be cut off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see&hellip; In that case, it would certainly be better for someone to stay behind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo nodded meekly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is. As much as I&rsquo;d like to join the fight, it&rsquo;s a shame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">In this way he could justify himself, Diablo snickered inwardly. His intellect was vainly efficient, and he was a master at making excuses. He was the dark companion Rimuru could rely on in times of need.</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">However, Ultima&rsquo;s ability to interrogate was also sharp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, who&rsquo;s the rat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tsk&mdash;Diablo inwardly clicked his tongue. He had been in a good mood at the prospect of observing the battle between Rimuru and Velgrynd, but his frustrations grew as these interlopers refused to leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a pity, Ultima. I had hoped that you would have noticed without me having to tell you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The little sarcasm was payback for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, there was no need to hide anything, so he would answer honestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Yuuki Kagurazaka. I also scouted out other presences, but none of them matched Yuuki. If he&rsquo;s hiding somewhere on the ship, then it&rsquo;s fine. However, if he&rsquo;s trying to interfere with Rimuru-sama, then he can&rsquo;t just be left alone, can he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. It would be disobeying Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s edict.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, nobody should ever interfere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I don&rsquo;t know what the rat wants just yet, but at least one of us needs to stay here and watch over Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One half of Diablo desired to observe Rimuru&rsquo;s fight, while the other thought of the supposedly meaningful role he had to play. Ultimately, Diablo&rsquo;s desire won out. In any case, he was satisfied that Ultima and Carrera were convinced. In the end, they agreed with Diablo, albeit quite dissatisfied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whatever. I&rsquo;ll just take my frustrations out on the people over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, go right ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one will complain if I go on a rampage, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. If anything, you can even finish off Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, well that does sound like fun. In that case, I&rsquo;ll stop here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ll go on a rampage and get rid of this pent-up frustration!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, yes, Diablo nodded his head vigorously. If that was enough to convince them, then it was a small price to pay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera and Ultima left in a hurry, saying that if they were late, they would miss out on the best part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please do your best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo sent them off with a big smile on his face. Then, he took off after Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the same spot after everyone had left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace thought to himself, </span><span class="c1 c2">Nobody cares about me.</span><span class="c1 c17">&nbsp;He </span><span class="c1">felt a little lonely after being left behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-well then, I guess I&rsquo;ll go and help Kagali-sama&hellip;&rdquo; Laplace mumbled, answering no one in particular, and left.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, unbeknownst to everyone, things were in motion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to Rimuru&rsquo;s anger, the monsters began to evolve. They rebuilt their bodies at an incredible rate, acquiring new abilities&mdash;all of which were returned by the &lsquo;Food Chain&rsquo; into &lsquo;accumulated power&rsquo; without Rimuru even being aware.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like how Geld had awakened. The demons had evolved recklessly. Others who had yet to awaken would follow suit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was more than just an evolutionary awakening. It was efficiently managed and was a factor that would increase Rimuru&rsquo;s power. More effective and better suited for real-world combat. Beyond the limits that no one yet knows, Rimuru&rsquo;s power awaited its release&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

On the four sides of the ship, four knights from the third to sixth rank were on guard. Behind Kondou was Marco, and the rest of the Single Digit members were present. On Rudra&rsquo;s right, Velgrynd was in her fixed place. Her last &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; was standing by to protect Rudra if anything happened. However, the current Velgrynd, in order to concentrate on the battle with Rimuru, had leaned back against Rudra in the chair that had been set up for her, letting her consciousness fall back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra, who was gently stroking Velgrynd&rsquo;s blue hair, muttered in annoyance when he saw Demon Lord Rimuru on the move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s something else. It was a lapse in judgment on my part. That slime should have been dealt with first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words were tantamount to declaring that the battle was not over yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until just a moment ago, they had been celebrating the successful capture of Veldora. But now, there was no sign of such an atmosphere left. They had recognized Rimuru and the others as enemies. With the Demon Lord Rimuru at the head of the group, even the executive majins had returned. At this time, there was still room to spare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, to think they could escape from the Fortress of Dreams, I must have been a bit naive. They must have been desperate to come back because they lost their master, the source of their power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra said with a sneer. However, after Rimuru nullified Kondou&rsquo;s attack, Rudra took the situation seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Above all, the demons that Rimuru had summoned posed a problem. Incarnated greater demons were a nuisance in and of themselves. And yet, Rimuru had increased the power of those demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since it was unclear just what he had done, it was only natural to be wary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tatsuya, you didn&rsquo;t cut any corners, did you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course not. The &lsquo;Remove&rsquo; and &lsquo;Necrosis&rsquo; both failed to work. Apparently, he is an opponent who cannot be defeated without a serious fight,&rdquo; Kondou replied, admitting he, too, had failed to see through Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Rudra had said, he judged that Rimuru was an extremely dangerous opponent. He had prioritized the capture of Veldora, but that had been a mistake. They should have taken them both at the same time, not one or the other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he had come to that conclusion, the situation had already unfolded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew that the Demon Lord Rimuru was an enemy with whom one could not be careless. That was why he had devised a plan to trap and later dispose of him. He had judged that if they took away Veldora, Rimuru&rsquo;s stronghold, then he would naturally succumb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou&rsquo;s judgment had backfired. Just as Rimuru was Veldora&rsquo;s trigger, so was Veldora&rsquo;s existence to Rimuru. Quickly realizing that he had pulled the trigger, Kondou had tried to kill Rimuru before anyone else. He unleashed the &lsquo;Remove&rsquo; and &lsquo;Necrosis&rsquo; bullets. Now that the &lsquo;Judgment&rsquo; was no longer available, this combo was his strongest means of attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the result was that he did not cause Rimuru any harm and could not even halt his actions. A demon lord deprived of Veldora, the source of his power, and now reduced to a powerless existence?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How laughable. A tyrannical will, enraged by the thought of losing his sworn friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what he should have thought. Far from cutting any corners, they would be defeated if they didn&rsquo;t take the challenge seriously&mdash;he concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If Tatsuya says that much, then even the four knights won&rsquo;t be able to win. I&rsquo;ll let Veldora deal with him and test his powers that I&rsquo;ve acquired.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra understood the threat of Rimuru without needing Kondou to tell him. The only reason he let him explain it was so that those present would share his understanding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Single Digits were a group of talented people gathered by Rudra. That is why, by making the enemy&rsquo;s threat known to all, he cautioned them not to make any mistakes. Rimuru was certainly a threat, but he could be dealt with provided they weren&rsquo;t careless. That said, he did not want to lose any of the force gathered here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra was being extremely cautious until the final grand showdown. He wanted to challenge Guy without losing any of his men. As things stood, victory was imminent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The capture of Veldora had given the Empire a huge advantage. For Rudra, he was one step closer to putting an end to his long-standing game with Guy. He could not afford to make a mistake here. And so, Rudra decided to go all out and put Veldora up against Rimuru. Combined with Velgrynd&rsquo;s support, he was sure that nothing could go wrong.</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">In the meantime, it was up to Kondo and the others to deal with Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates. There should be no problems. If possible, Rudra had wanted to take Rimuru under his command as well, but now that this was happening, there was no choice but to eliminate him. Now that he had Veldora, the main target, it was out of the question for a demon lord to disrupt his plans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, a demon lord was a weak existence compared to the True Dragon race. This was why Rudra, while acknowledging Rimuru as a threat, believed that there was no way the mission could fail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The True Dragons were the strongest beings in this world. Against two such True Dragons, Rimuru&rsquo;s defeat was inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was only one thing that bothered him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&hellip;Back then, why did Veldora stop resisting my domination?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was his only question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given enough time, there was no doubt his domination would have succeeded anyway. It was possible to infer that Veldora had given up after realizing this. But to Rudra, that did not seem to be the only reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through the &lsquo;Regalia Dominion,&rsquo; Rudra had been able to feel Veldora&rsquo;s anger directly. As such, he understood that Veldora was not someone who gave up easily. Could it be that Veldora had been trying to protect something more important than himself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such doubts swirled in Rudra&rsquo;s mind. And if that was the case, what was it that was so important&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra shook his head in denial. For Veldora to prioritize the Demon Lord Rimuru, it was an assumption that Rudra could not accept&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

She gently nuzzled his head and stroked his dragon scales.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good boy. The next time you wake up, you&rsquo;ll be one of us. Then I&rsquo;ll take very good care of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd foresaw the end of the long game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, things would not be so simple&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Rimuru appeared. Velgrynd&rsquo;s mood dropped at the sight of this tactless interloper. At the same time, she felt a small sense of crisis. She wondered how he had escaped from that &lsquo;Fortress of Dreams.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Velgrynd pondered what to do, things began to take an unexpected turn. Rimuru had summoned a large number of demons and empowered them as if in a show of force. It was a provocation. In front of Velgrynd, he exposed his cards. It was too bold of an act, as if to say, &lsquo;Stop me if you can.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that wasn&rsquo;t all. Among the demons Rimuru had summoned were Testarossa and the others. She didn&rsquo;t know what he did, but they too had evolved into higher beings, &lsquo;devil lords.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sensing this, Velgrynd became very wary of Rimuru. In addition, there was another anomaly. The waves of Rimuru&rsquo;s anger were similar to those of her little brother, Veldora. Although still a demon lord, a mere slime was cloaked in the same haki as the True Dragon race. For Velgrynd, this was an unbelievable reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even taking only that one point into account, there was no doubt that this was an abnormal situation. If she had only heard the report, she would have laughed it off as impossible. But now that she had seen it with her own eyes, she had no choice but to believe it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right before her eyes, this maiden-like demon lord was unleashing unbridled waves of fury without restraint. Those waves were clearly indicative of the danger. A human who was not resistant to these fluctuations would have died in an instant just from the exposure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, this was not limited to humans. Any higher beings, ones who were considered superior&mdash;any beings below the A rank defined by humans&mdash;would die without even being able to resist. It was an overwhelmingly powerful Demon Lord Haki, comparable to that of the True Dragon&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Now then, what should I do? To begin with, he was the one who even tamed those Primordials. I had thought that kid (Veldora) had been fooled by him, but it looks like I was seriously mistaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it was just Veldora, then it&rsquo;s possible that he was just being tricked with words. But that method would never have worked against those cunning and sophisticated Primordials.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once understanding that, the plan would have to be reconsidered. It was clear from his &lsquo;Demon Lord Haki&rsquo; that there was something about Demon Lord Rimuru. When one thought more about it, Veldora&rsquo;s growth was also astounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three hundred years ago, it would have been impossible for him to even wound Velgrynd. But in the brief time since the seal had been lifted, he had become an extraordinarily skilled fighter. Veldora had grown far beyond Velgrynd&rsquo;s expectations. The reason for this must have also been the demon lord in front of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I was planning to go back to my homeland and relax&hellip; But it can&rsquo;t be helped. If I don&rsquo;t get rid of him here, it will be a disaster for Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd made a decision. She would deal with this directly and crush Rimuru once and for all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she didn&rsquo;t kill him now, that slime would surely become a threat&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Velgrynd decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although many magicules were consumed in the battle just now, Velgrynd was able to get them replenished from Veldora. As for Veldora, even though he had fought so fiercely, he had not exhausted his energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, there would be no problem even if she fought at full power now. Velgrynd calmly shifted back into a fighting stance. She had discarded the feeling of victory, that everything had gone as planned. Such pride had led to the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she had disposed of Rimuru in the Fortress of Dreams at that time, Rimuru would not have summoned the demons. That would have left only the final battle to be fought. In that light, the current situation was not good, but it was not the worst either. She still had a good chance to win, and as long as she made the right moves, she should be able to handle the situation without any problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was an anticlimactic turn of events. Contrary to Velgrynd&rsquo;s expectations, Rimuru was the only one who came at her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I&rsquo;ve won. If they had all come at me, even I would have had some trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how much of a threat Rimuru was, she and Veldora would not be defeated if they both took on the enemy&mdash;she was convinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the game had to be finished at once. If the demon lord&rsquo;s subordinates got in the way, the battle could drag on. Before that happened, Velgrynd chose to fight a short and decisive battle. It was Velgrynd who was acting according to her instincts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Rudra! Give Veldora the order to attack Demon Lord Rimuru with all his might.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hm. So then you also feel the danger of that person as I do? In that case, there&rsquo;s no need to hesitate. Veldora, get rid of the enemy before you!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to Velgrynd&rsquo;s request, Rudra activated the &lsquo;Regalia Dominion.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was relieved to see that Rudra considered Rimuru as dangerous as she did. As long as Rudra was on his guard, victory seemed certain. With two of the supreme True Dragons challenging the enemy at the same time, defeat was unthinkable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A terrifying battle was about to begin.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Ahead of Rimuru, Veldora roared into the sky. The atmosphere shook at the fierce impact, and Veldora flew out. Velgrynd also followed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She roared as if confident in her victory. And with that, an attack was launched to annihilate Rimuru. Veldora was going at full strength from the start. The same converging storm attack that had tormented Velgrynd&mdash;the roar of destruction &lsquo;Storm Blast&rsquo;&mdash;attacked Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Notice.

The fact that this was denied by Rimuru made it a little unsettling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although its reaction was limited to an exceedingly small area of the computational domain, the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; was indeed confused. It was not uncommon for Rimuru to ignore the opinions of Wisdom King Raphael, but this time was different. Such a feeling could only be felt by the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; because it had known Rimuru for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was abnormal for a part of the world&rsquo;s laws, a Skill, to have such emotions&hellip;but the party concerned was not aware of this fact&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Storm Blast&rsquo; grazed Rimuru who had taken a forceful evasive action. Immediately after that, the &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo; that normally protected Rimuru was penetrated, and an explosion occurred in the place where Rimuru had been just a short while ago. The &lsquo;Storm Blast&rsquo; had unleashed its destructive power. Had the evasive action been delayed, his injury would have been inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Witnessing this, the level of confusion in &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; increased.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Calculation failure? Unforeseen situation? Unable to comprehend&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How did Rimuru know that? The result of the calculation was perfect, there was no mistake. Wisdom King Raphael began to scan the information, wondering if it had overlooked some condition. Even after computing at a speed that surpassed that of a quantum computer, the cause was still unknown.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Confusion. It should have been 100 percent defensible according to predictions.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unintentionally, words that didn&rsquo;t need to be said leaked out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seemingly impossible, it was the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; trying to justify itself. A mere Skill uttering excuses was something that should not be possible. However, no one noticed this. They were in the middle of a battle, and this was not the time for casual verification. The confused &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; received a reprimand from Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;This is no time to be stupid! Veldora has the &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo;. As I recall, there was an ability called &lsquo;Probability Manipulation&rsquo; or something troublesome like that, right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing that, the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; came to its senses. Yes, that was true. How could it have forgotten such an important thing? It was strange&mdash;just then, &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; felt something unusual. It could only assume that it was being interfered with by someone. However, the exact cause remained unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; hesitated, wondering if it should tell Rimuru about it. It did not want to admit to Rimuru that the cause was unknown out of pride. However, if nothing was done, there was a strong possibility that Rimuru would be harmed. It knew that it had to tell him, and the results of its calculations told it so. But&mdash;for the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael,&rsquo; being branded as incompetent by Rimuru was the same as losing its meaning of existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking of such a thing in itself was an act of betrayal to its lord. For a Skill to be so lost, it was something that should never have happened&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; was plunged into violent confusion, Rimuru&rsquo;s words flowed in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Veldora is an absurdity. It&rsquo;s no wonder he can outperform even your perfect calculations. More importantly, don&rsquo;t get upset just because you made a small mistake. Veldora can&rsquo;t be predicted. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it either! Don&rsquo;t think. Believe in yourself. I&rsquo;ll deal with Veldora, so you should deal with Velgrynd!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Just knowing that is good enough&rsquo; Rimuru said. He spoke to the Wisdom King Raphael, who was only a Skill, as if he were treating it as a true partner&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So please? There are two of them, but there are also the two of us. If you hold off Velgrynd, I&rsquo;ll find an opening to free Veldora in the meantime. That&rsquo;s why, please hang on at all costs, okay? I&rsquo;m counting on you, partner!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words soothed the confused and empty thoughts of &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being relied upon? Even though a mistake was made?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru still believed in the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael,&rsquo; who was constantly making mistakes.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ahh!! This lord still needs &lsquo;me,&rsquo; who is nothing more than a computational power&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The anxiety had already disappeared. Regaining its usual confidence, the Wisdom King Raphael responded.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Done. Understood. From here on, the individual Velgrynd will be intercepted.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru&mdash;the beloved master of the Wisdom King Raphael, was not such a small being that he could be bound by something as uncertain as &lsquo;probability.&rsquo; Therefore, it could be at ease and follow him with faith.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that moment, Rimuru casually announced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;&hellip;Come to think of it, I&rsquo;ve never called you by a proper name. I usually call you &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael-san&rsquo; or partner, or whatever I feel like. I&rsquo;m sorry if it&rsquo;s a little bit weird at a time like this, but I&rsquo;m officially giving you a &lsquo;name.&rsquo;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; found this incomprehensible. The &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; was filled with a strange sensation. It was bewilderment. It was rapture. It was&mdash;an outpouring of emotions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Wisdom King could not hide its confusion at the incalculable uncertainties that had sprung up inside it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">What was Master saying?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Wisdom King Raphael was confused. But at the same time, it also realized Rimuru&rsquo;s intentions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ahh&hellip; He was worried after noticing my poor condition. He must have been more saddened than anyone else by the loss of Veldora. And yet, in spite of that, he still cared for others. Rimuru was that kind of a person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well then, how about &ldquo;Ciel&rdquo;?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;!!!!!!!!!!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You&rsquo;ve always taught me so much, so I&rsquo;ll call you &ldquo;Ciel&rdquo; for short. What do you think? It may not be satisfactory, but just bear with it. If you have any complaints, go take it out on that red dragon!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru remarked, as if he were hiding his embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo;&mdash;no, &ldquo;Ciel&rdquo; experienced a fullness of emotion that a Skill could not have otherwise felt.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;Ahh, I</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;am now in eternal bliss&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, that&rsquo;s what it thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that same moment, the time of evolution had arrived. This was the moment when the Manas &ldquo;Ciel&rdquo; was born from the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;I, I am Ciel. A Manas</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c1">, the unifier of Skills. I am with the &lsquo;soul&rsquo; of Rimuru-sama (Master), and the one who provides support to my lord. Rimuru-sama, I look forward to working with you from here on.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel thought. There was nothing to be afraid of anymore. Even in a crisis situation, it did not feel dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;O-oh. Same here, I&rsquo;m looking forward as well?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mere sound of Rimuru&rsquo;s voice filled Ciel with a sense of euphoria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;In that case, show them what you can do!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Ciel, Rimuru&rsquo;s command was the highest reward.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;As you command, my lord!!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Wisdom King Raphael had awakened and became Ciel. And then, in order to fulfill Rimuru&rsquo;s wishes, its power blossomed even more sharply.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Naturally, Velgrynd had not gone easy on Rimuru. The &lsquo;Burning Breath&rsquo; was strengthened by &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo;, and there was no way a mere &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; would be able to prevent it. In fact, unless he was a superior opponent who could see through the attack perfectly, there must be some kind of pay off from the blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, Rimuru showed no signs of exhaustion. It was impossible even for the three primordial demonesses to withstand an attack from Velgrynd&rsquo;s Dragon Mode and remain unscathed. The fact that Rimuru was able to do such a thing without hesitation meant that this demon lord could not be attacked half-heartedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd felt uncomfortable but continued to think calmly. Because she had more magicules than him, it was possible that she was losing in terms of skill quality. It was also possible that Demon Lord Rimuru was completely immune to heat attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd decided to keep trying instead of worrying about it. She made partial &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; appear, as she had done to Veldora, and deployed eleven rays of light&mdash;Nuclear magic Nuclear Cannon. On top of that, the eleven heads all emitted Burning Breath simultaneously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This multi-stage attack, consisting of twenty-two heat rays, was so hot that it could easily vaporize an asteroid. If Rimuru was able to survive this, it would prove that thermal attacks were ineffective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The result was something that Velgrynd did not want to admit. The heat rays that had crossed to block Rimuru&rsquo;s escape route converged on him. Every single one was repelled by a shield of light that Rimuru had created.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Tsk, damn it! It&rsquo;s as if it&rsquo;s all calculated, perfectly defended with the most minimal of movements!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not funny, Velgrynd thought indignantly. On top of the fact that thermal attacks were useless against Rimuru, Velgrynd couldn&rsquo;t forgive the fact that her current attack had practically been meaningless. If she had been able to wear him down even a little, the absolute difference in magicule quantity would have been enough to secure Velgrynd&rsquo;s victory. However, at present, Rimuru&rsquo;s energy consumption rate was equal to zero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this situation, Velgrynd might be the one to get exhausted first. Realizing this, Velgrynd decided to get serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, there was another unpleasant fact. Rimuru had only given Velgrynd a glance in the beginning, and then didn&rsquo;t even look at her after that. He concentrated on Veldora and did not even look at Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not use his shield against Veldora and avoided all attacks. It was only when there was nothing he could do, that he tried to offset them with the same kind of attack. And yet, when faced with Velgrynd&rsquo;s attacks, he merely deflected them with only his shield of light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though he was able to perceive his entire surroundings through &lsquo;Magic Perception&rsquo;, he was clearly ignoring her. This was tantamount to declaring that Velgrynd was not a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This irritated her to no end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">You will regret making a fool out of me!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The proud Velgrynd decided to unleash the most powerful attack she could muster.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While looking hatefully at Rimuru who was still ignoring her, Velgrynd condensed a large amount of mana. Then she applied it throughout her own body. She applied the &ldquo;support&rdquo; of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo;, and the power of &lsquo;acceleration&rsquo; symbolized by her own heat affinity. If these were activated in parallel and used on herself, she would be able to forcefully increase her heat, that is, her momentum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This made Velgrynd capable of moving at a speed several thousand times faster than the speed of sound, the fastest physical action in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So then, what would happen if the target of this power was someone other than herself? The increase in momentum was not a problem for Velgrynd, who was a spiritual life form with physical resistance, but was there really anyone else who could withstand this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The answer was no. No matter what kind of life form the other was, their body would not be able to endure a forced continuous acceleration. The same was true for spiritual life forms, where even information was converted into energy, eventually leading to thermal decay. And that was exactly what Velgrynd meant when she said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Die! Not even a single piece of flesh will be left on your body as it crumbles away! &lsquo;Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was her most powerful technique that surpassed even the &lsquo;Burning Embrace.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo; contained Velgrynd&rsquo;s full power. It was a secret technique she had devised for Velzard in the coming day of the final showdown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, it would be too much of a waste to show this to a mere demon lord, but the furious Velgrynd didn&rsquo;t care about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the roar of the crimson dragon, the &ldquo;surge of destruction&rdquo; was unleashed on Rimuru. The ultimate blow of the Scorch Dragon, as if to show Velgrynd&rsquo;s pride in being the fastest, would cause all matter to collapse in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would bury the enemy with a speed that no one could avoid. By the time Rimuru, who was focused on Veldora, could notice what was happening, it would be too late. No, he would disappear from this world before he even had time to understand what was going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I had wanted to make him regret underestimating me, but I didn&rsquo;t have the time for that. That is the only thing I regret</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that level of absolute certainty, Velgrynd began to confirm the results of her attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&mdash;?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon seeing Rimuru standing there unharmed, Velgrynd was completely stunned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;No way, that&rsquo;s impossible&rsquo;&mdash;she even doubted her own eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way anyone could withstand such an inescapable, absolute blow completely unscathed. Even if it was Demon Lord Guy Crimson or Velgrynd&rsquo;s sister, Velzard the Frost Dragon, Velgrynd thought that it was powerful enough to bring them down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Unharmed? That&rsquo;s not possible. My &lsquo;Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo; is capable of affecting all &lsquo;Barriers&rsquo; and defensive Skills! What did you do?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was agitated. It would be plausible if it was offset by some other means, but it should have been impossible to nullify it with a &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; or such. Velgrynd&rsquo;s composure was shaken by the incomprehensible reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; Rimuru replied. &ldquo;That move was indeed dangerous, but it was a straightforward attack, so it was easy to eat, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, the response to Velgrynd was all thanks to Ciel. It had guided Velgrynd&rsquo;s attack in a brilliantly calculated manner. Ciel prioritized Rimuru over everything else. It completely shut down Velgrynd as it was commanded, so as not to get in Rimuru&rsquo;s way. The nature of the attack was analyzed with &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; and the effective measures were selected and implemented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of those measures was using the shield of light, which had a special effect on Velgrynd&rsquo;s abilities. The current Ciel was worthy of its moniker as the unifier of Skills, and even all of Rimuru&rsquo;s Ultimate Skills were under its control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Ciel had just done was use &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; from the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo;. It instantly understood Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo; and prevented the attack&rsquo;s influence by &lsquo;isolating&rsquo; it into the &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; which had now evolved into the &lsquo;Imaginary Space.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The attack just now was certainly capable of destroying Rimuru. It would have been impossible to defend it by normal means, and even the computing power of the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; would not have been able to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Ciel was different. Now that it was no longer a mere Skill, it had evolved into an existence that was a whole new kind of different from the likes of &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; and others. No matter what the enemy&rsquo;s attack was, it would not be a problem if one could correctly identify its nature. As if to prove this, Ciel mastered the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; perfectly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After &lsquo;isolating&rsquo; the attack, the energy could be absorbed into the &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo;. In this way, the &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; had been transformed into a defensive measure that surpassed even the &lsquo;Absolute Defense&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was no wonder that Velgrynd was surprised. After all, everything happened long before even Rimuru himself could think how dangerous the attack was. It was only in order to keep Velgrynd from sensing this that he responded to her in that provocative tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not the end of Ciel&rsquo;s scheme. It worked with Rimuru more smoothly than ever before, using even conversation as a weapon to hunt down Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Velgrynd was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Don&rsquo;t be stupid! You&rsquo;re saying you ate it? You ate my most powerful technique, the Scorch Dragon &lsquo;Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo;?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though she was in the middle of a battle, she couldn&rsquo;t understand Rimuru&rsquo;s words and was stunned. Although it was only for a moment, it was a fatal blunder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad that you&rsquo;re in shock from your attack failing, but you haven&rsquo;t forgotten that you&rsquo;re in the middle of a battle, have you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time he asked this, it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel&rsquo;s actions were flawless, and Rimuru approved of them all.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Measurement of Velgrynd&rsquo;s magicule count is complete. Taking into consideration her nature and the characteristics of her powers, it has been determined that she can be sealed for several hundred seconds in an &lsquo;Insulation Prison&rsquo;. Now activating!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Velgrynd realized it, the multi-layered magic circle had been completed. It was a synthesized skill from the combination of &lsquo;Infinite Prison&rsquo; and &lsquo;Insulated Space&rsquo; of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;. Ciel had created it just now to be used against Velgrynd. Velgrynd was trapped inside of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This battle airspace was already under Ciel&rsquo;s computational control. Temperature, humidity, gravity, the flow of wind, the light of the sun, the pulse of life&mdash;all of these things were in the palm of Ciel&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, no matter what Velgrynd did, it was impossible for her to leave this airspace. The glow of the &lsquo;Insulation Prison,&rsquo; activated after Ciel&rsquo;s declaration, and made Velgrynd feel dizzy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Am I really going down just like this?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crimson dragon trembled in humiliation at being defeated by Rimuru. However, no matter what Velgrynd did, the &lsquo;Insulation Prison&rsquo; would not budge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just keep quiet for a while! I&rsquo;ll play with you once I free Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words signaled Velgrynd&rsquo;s defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I&rsquo;ll admit defeat this time, but I still have Parallel Existence. With Soul Corridor, this &lsquo;Insulation Prison&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be a problem!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was still one thing Velgrynd could do. She would have to give up her current body, but she could put most of her energy back into the &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; she had left by Rudra&rsquo;s side as insurance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it wasn&rsquo;t over yet, and Velgrynd, while enduring the full humiliation, began to move cautiously. Slowly, so as not to be noticed by Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her magicules were gradually transferred through the Soul Corridor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Completely unaware that this was exactly what Ciel wanted all along&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

It was a perfect strategy designed by Ciel, in which it had boldly launched a special move, aiming for the moment when the magicule count decreased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By combining my Skills with the effects corresponding to the target&rsquo;s characteristics, it was able to achieve this. That was easy enough to say, but the amount of computing power it would actually take to make this possible was completely beyond me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, I was at a greatly significant disadvantage in magicule count. In order to contain such a superior opponent, Ciel had efficiently constructed an &ldquo;insulated prison&rdquo; with only superior attributes. In other words, this could also be called a </span><span class="c1 c2">calculation prison</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that operated according to the enemy&rsquo;s characteristics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that Ciel was able to achieve this was the reason for its complete victory. The key to this strategy was whether or not we could withstand Velgrynd&rsquo;s attack. I trusted Ciel&rsquo;s calculation, but if it had read things wrong, I would have been the one who was finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why did I trust it so much?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was simple. It was because my opponent was Veldora, and I had declared that I would let Ciel handle Velgrynd. Besides, I knew that Ciel could do it. And it lived up to my expectations perfectly&mdash;no, even more than I could have imagined. It used my Skills more skillfully than I ever could and fulfilled its role. As expected of my partner, I thought of Ciel as such more than ever.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An unexpected miscalculation had made Ciel more reliable, but I must not forget my purpose. I had to free Veldora before Velgrynd began moving. So, how many seconds could she be held back?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Even if Velgrynd goes wild, the &lsquo;Insulation Prison&rsquo; can still be maintained for the remaining 200 seconds. However, worrying about that is unnecessary.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Uh, why? I was grateful for just the 200 seconds, but Velgrynd is still a threat. I can&rsquo;t ignore her&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No. As planned, Velgrynd has turned to evasive action. I knew it was possible for her to transfer energy using the Soul Corridor, so it is expected for her to flee without worrying about this &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see. Since any &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; can be the main body, there is no need to forcefully break the &lsquo;Insulation Prison.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, that&rsquo;s not it. Ciel had prepared an escape path in anticipation of this. That&rsquo;s right&hellip; Velgrynd had shown too much of her hand. She showed off &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; and fought the three demon girls and Veldora and so on. All of these situations had been monitored, so Ciel must have had no shortage of material to analyze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; was not an inexhaustible source. Therefore, Ciel may have succeeded in deducing the total amount of Velgrynd&rsquo;s magicules by measuring it. Once that was known, it was possible to figure out how many more &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; they must face to defeat her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel, instead, took advantage of this. It had seen through Velgrynd&rsquo;s insurance policy and induced her into using it as a method of escape. After all, if I had such a useful power, I would use it as a means of insurance, too. However, it was impossible for my &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; to reproduce an Ultimate Skill. It was a little disappointing, but I was willing to admit defeat in that aspect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, while the &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; seemed completely versatile, it could only be used as a decoy or against lower-ranked opponents. Well, it was still extremely useful as insurance, and it could be a great asset depending on the opponent. I could think of many ways to use it, but it seemed to be ineffective against opponents of the same rank or higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel had uncovered that weakness. I mean, its computational power was a bit scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything was going according to Ciel&rsquo;s plan, as if it was predicting the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed at how far it has come, but Ciel was my partner. Better to stop worrying about unnecessary things and quickly get on with what we had to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel had managed to make even Velgrynd&mdash;of the supreme True Dragon race&mdash;dance in the palm of her hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hm, in that case, I can&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;All right. But just to be safe, I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to deal with Veldora so that we can wrap this up in under 200 seconds. Give me a hand, Ciel!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;As you wish!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&mdash;no, Ciel and I faced Veldora directly, which had been the original goal. This was precious time that Ciel had earned. It may be short, but it was infinite to us. It would be a shame on us if we couldn&rsquo;t make the most of it. It wasn&rsquo;t a question of whether we could or couldn&rsquo;t do it, but that we would do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that resolve, I resumed my assault on Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

This was what I wanted to do, not just something that Guy requested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had been surprised by the birth of Ciel, but I switched back to my usual self. I was already calm now. But that didn&rsquo;t mean my anger was gone. I decided to save this anger until I could take it out on Emperor Rudra. The main priority had to come first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being said, about Veldora&hellip; What I was trying to do was to talk to Veldora. Controlling Veldora was simple to say, but it would take an enormous amount of effort to bend a massive energy source such as a True Dragon to your will. In the first place, it would be extremely difficult to take away the free will of a spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I saw it, there were several types of domination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Charm control, where the person submitted wholeheartedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coercive control, where free will was taken away and the person was forced to obey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Complete control, where the person was not even aware that they were being controlled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Yuuki&rsquo;s case, it was complete control, but in Kagali&rsquo;s case, it was coercive control. And Veldora&rsquo;s case was also coercive control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were distinct stages of coercive control. There were various patterns, from those who still had free will and resisted, to those whose free will had been erased and they became robots that never disobeyed orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kagali didn&rsquo;t appear to have any free will left, but what about Veldora? Spiritual life forms were known for their strong wills. I didn&rsquo;t think the free will of such an existence could be erased so easily, so I thought it would be meaningful to call out to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Veldora&rsquo;s resistance was too intense. I suppose his orders were to eliminate the enemy&mdash;me, but he didn&rsquo;t even hesitate at all and attacked viciously. Even if I had left Velgrynd to Ciel, Veldora alone would have been trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I still had my storm-based powers, so I could cancel out Veldora&rsquo;s attacks. However, it was too much for me to call out to him, as it took too much effort to cancel out those unbelievably powerful attacks. That was why I now decided to leave the defense to Ciel. The main problem was his &lsquo;Probability Manipulation&rsquo;, but I trusted that the current Ciel could handle it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From now on, it&rsquo;s showtime&mdash;I thought to myself as I approached Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The storm raged about. But the place where I was remained as calm as the eye of a storm. Somehow, I felt a powerful sense of security. Veldora&rsquo;s attacks were canceled out, without me feeling as desperate as I had been before. There was little to no consumption of magicules. Moreover, I was in ridiculously good shape right now.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Of course. Through the Soul Corridor, the monsters under your command have sent their &lsquo;Tribute&rsquo; through &lsquo;Food Chain&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I see, so that&rsquo;s what it was!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt a surge of energy in my body earlier, but thanks to my friends, I was able to fight Veldora. Now that I knew that, I couldn&rsquo;t afford to make any mistakes here. Once I finally reached Veldora, I called out to him, &ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting, Veldora. Do you recognize me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no response. Rather, I got &lsquo;Thunderstorm&rsquo; in return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was so annoyed that I couldn&rsquo;t help but punch him. However, or perhaps I should say naturally, it didn&rsquo;t work on Veldora&rsquo;s massive body. Unless I put not only my strength but also my magicules into it, I would not be able to do much damage. However, this was fine. My goal was to wake up Veldora, so I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to beat him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I kept hitting Veldora in the face as hard as I could. Once I was this close, most of his attacks would be out of range. On the contrary, it was too close that if he attacked, it would hit him as well. Well, since he was being controlled, he might shoot magic at me without caring about that, but Ciel would take care of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I punched and punched, and gave an occasional kick. But Veldora only roared&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;How about using &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; on Veldora and sealing him in &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo;?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel made a terrifying proposal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I had to choose between &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;, I would say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, but&hellip; Was such a thing even possible?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No problem. The &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; has been placed under my command, so it can be executed immediately upon your order.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How reliable&hellip;I must say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Predation&rsquo; was a slime&rsquo;s Intrinsic Skill, and &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; was the result of its evolution to the limit. It had the highest affinity with me and was the easiest power for me to handle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel had optimized it, so it should work for Veldora as well. In addition, this &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; could be activated from anywhere in my Demon Slime body. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even need to touch the target. As long as I could visually confirm, I could affect that space. Its power increases with proximity, so now that I was closer to Veldora, I could expect a significant effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, the decision was made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pain in the ass, Veldora! Don&rsquo;t make me worry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as I shouted that, I tried devouring Veldora with &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kuahahaha! It was a small mistake. Forgive me!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard a voice I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to hear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Veldora, right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hm, it&rsquo;s me. Your sworn friend, the Storm Dragon Veldora!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This couldn&rsquo;t be a trap. Because that response was so ridiculous. The owner of that cheerful voice could only be Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hey, are you still conscious?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Mm. To tell you the truth, I quickly detached my </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at that time. It was impossible to talk, but it did preserve my ego!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s it. He couldn&rsquo;t speak, but his consciousness still remained. Was it because the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; got to Veldora&rsquo;s body, that we could use &lsquo;telepathy&rsquo; through our </span><span class="c1 c2">hearts?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, I was glad that he was safe. But that also made me angry in another sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What?! Then hurry up and take your body back!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t be so carefree after making me worry so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How upset I had been because of Veldora&hellip; Thinking about it made me want to complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;If I could do that, I would have done so long ago! Rather than that, Rimuru, shouldn&rsquo;t you have been calmer and acted more cautiously?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speak for yourself. Not to mention&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You idiot! If I&rsquo;d been calm, I would never have been so reckless as to take on two True Dragons at the same time!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t need him to point that out to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After I had calmed down, I thought to myself that I was lucky to be alive. However, it would have been impossible for me to act cautious at that time. Cautious was not a word that could be used when dealing with True Dragons in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was thinking about this, Veldora happily warned me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Oh, look out. I&rsquo;m about to unleash my Black Lightning!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t say that so casually as if it were small talk!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, it wasn&rsquo;t Black Lightning that was fired, but the Death-Calling Wind. In any case, Ciel canceled it out and we successfully avoided it, but what was the point in lying?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You! What lightning?! That&rsquo;s the death-calling wind that destroys souls!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was annoyed and complained, but Veldora laughed and gave me an excuse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Mmm?! My bad, Kuahahaha! It seems that I still don&rsquo;t fully understand my own body. I was able to get a sense of activating a technique, but the accuracy rate is only 50 percent.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it was not helpful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemy also has &lsquo;Probability Manipulation&rsquo;, so it would be safer to just ignore Veldora&rsquo;s predictions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Got it. That&rsquo;s enough, so you just shut up. It won&rsquo;t be funny if I fail at this critical moment by trusting some random statement, will it?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing me express my disappointment, Veldora began to panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Wait, wait Rimuru! I-I&rsquo;ll do my best. I will help you out somehow!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite his desperate assurances, there was no basis for his remarks. This was a time where reason should prevail over emotion. Besides, I had already been assisted by him. Just hearing Veldora&rsquo;s voice was enough to calm me down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;As long as you&rsquo;re okay, that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After making sure that he was safe once again, Veldora laughed loudly as usual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kuahahaha! Of course I&rsquo;m okay. I am the strongest dragon!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was relieved to hear that. And just as I was thinking that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;To begin with, it wasn&rsquo;t Rudra who cut off the Soul Corridor, but me. That means I didn&rsquo;t actually lose to them!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Huh? What is he talking about, this old man&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What do you mean?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, it&rsquo;s simple. Rudra tried to take control of me while I was focused on Kondou&rsquo;s attack. The fact that three people, including my sister, actually joined forces is just a dirty ploy&mdash;I was outraged. But I made the difficult decision to at least avoid the worst-case scenario.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the &lsquo;strongest dragon&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t he being a little too careless? On the battlefield, there is no such thing as clean or dirty&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Don&rsquo;t be so arrogant! Honestly, what the hell are you doing? Didn&rsquo;t I always tell you not to let your guard down?!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kuahahaha! I didn&rsquo;t expect to be lectured in this situation!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help but be taken aback by Veldora&rsquo;s seemingly endless enjoyment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s an idiot, so I&rsquo;ll just move on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;So, that decision was to cut off the Soul Corridor?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Because Rudra&rsquo;s domination would have affected not only me, but also you through the Soul Corridor.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, he had rushed to cut off the Soul Corridor to protect me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once I heard that, I couldn&rsquo;t be mad at Veldora anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well then, just leave it to me!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Mm! I won&rsquo;t worry about a thing, because I believe in you.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it&rsquo;s never a bad thing to be relied upon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll set you free soon, so just wait here.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kuahahahaha! How reliable. I have the utmost faith in you, my friend Rimuru!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The situation with Veldora was clear. He had lost control of his body, but his </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was safe. It seems that Veldora couldn&rsquo;t take back control now, so I would have to do something about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, for example:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ciel, if you have Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">, can you revive the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo;?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No problem. The information of the power remains, so as long as the Soul Corridor is connected to Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">, the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo; can be restored.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem was easily solved. In short, all I had to do was eat up the Veldora in front of me and recover his </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">. The rest was just a matter of getting it done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now then, let&rsquo;s defeat him. The strongest opponent, Storm Dragon Veldora!!</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

In that case, I&rsquo;ll just get it over with quickly. There were two problems. The time limit and the location of the </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was still plenty of time. The current conversation had been prolonged by &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo;, so in fact not more than a few seconds had passed. There were still more than three minutes left, although there was actual offense and defense going on in between.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem was the location of the </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">. It was inside the body, so &lsquo;telepathy&rsquo; should be possible through magicules. Nevertheless, it was difficult to pinpoint the location.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I accidentally destroyed the </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">, it was all over. The mission would fail, and Veldora would have to be reborn. On the contrary, it would normally be more difficult to damage the </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">. That was because it was the most protected part of the body. However, Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was detached from his main body right now, so it was unprotected. If I had been careless and believed that I would not hit it, I could have accidentally hit and damaged it, which would have been unfortunate. Veldora would be released from Rudra&rsquo;s control, but his current personality would disappear, and our &lsquo;Soul Corridor&rsquo; would not be restored. Only that situation had to be avoided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I could devour Veldora in one go, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about this. Unfortunately, it was impossible to swallow Veldora whole in my &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo; without consent. I could weaken him and reduce the amount of magicules to some extent, or I could use &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; little by little and be careful not to hurt his </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at it this way, damaging him was out of the question. In fact, I was a little scared now when I thought about the beating I just gave him&hellip; It was difficult to think of Veldora as so fragile as I had thought he would be difficult to defeat or even damage. A shot or two of magic would not even scratch him and punching and kicking would be useless. Only by adding the effects of an Ultimate Skill to the various attacks would I be able to do any real damage at all. Even the most powerful holy magic, &lsquo;Disintegration,&rsquo; could only do insignificant damage to Veldora&rsquo;s massive body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This showed that the high durability of the True Dragon race was not a fluke. That&rsquo;s why he should have been able to withstand a few attacks, but there was always a chance. Especially now, Veldora was in a state of rampage without will. There was no telling what he would do, which was the sad thing about being controlled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless I learned where Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was, it would be safer for me not to attack him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that case, there was only one way. I had no choice but to do my best to find the </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by using &lsquo;predation&rsquo; little by little. It was a race against time, but there was no other choice. There was only three minutes, but three minutes was three minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without worrying about how much time I had left, I activated the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; at full power and bit down on Veldora&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My body returned from its human form to its slime form. Rather than a fluid form, it revealed the properties of an amorphous viscous body. Following my aggressive &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; intentions, I changed into the most suitable shape that Ciel had optimized for me. It would be more efficient since there were many contact surfaces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My fluctuating body ate its way through the surface of Veldora&rsquo;s body, wrapping around it. However, the target was too big. No matter how much I stretched my body, from Veldora&rsquo;s point of view, I was a mere dot. It was a daunting task, but I couldn&rsquo;t give up here. I accelerated the aggressive erosion without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, I activate the &lsquo;Soul Eater&rsquo; to probe for Veldora&rsquo;s nucleus. This would have been impossible without Ciel&rsquo;s assistance. As I had thought from its extraordinary strength, perhaps Ciel had acquired computing power that could not be compared to that of the Wisdom King Raphael. It appears that evolution upon getting a name was not limited to monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, thanks to Ciel, things were going well, but it wasn&rsquo;t without obstacles. I mean, I was in a lot of pain right now. Veldora&rsquo;s body had begun to resist the hostile presence. The &lsquo;Dragon Spirit Haki&rsquo; of the Storm Dragon was disintegrating my body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Between me, who was trying to devour, and the Storm Dragon who was trying to eliminate me&mdash;a fierce clash began.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling any pain, but an intense pain pierced my entire body. The heat should have been meaningless, but I felt as if I were melting at an unbearably high temperature. And then there was the agonizing suffering that I had felt for the first time in this world. The dangerous sensation that I was about to be wiped out of existence stimulated my survival instincts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, I would not let go of the erosion. I will win. I will overcome this suffering and save Veldora. Besides, I&rsquo;m not alone right now. I have a reliable partner in Ciel. I was going to devour the Storm Dragon and absorb Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">. For that, this level of suffering would be nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ciel, is that okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Leave it to me.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;ll be fine. After that reliable answer, I further expanded the erosion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing standing in my way was the energy I consumed. Normally, it would be restored as my own power, but with the True Dragon race, it was different. Instead of helping me, it was destroying my body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose the Dragon Factor was so powerful that it couldn&rsquo;t be bound by anyone. Yet, he was being controlled so this was quite troublesome, but now was not the time to complain about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every time a part of my body disappeared, my body would be reorganized with &lsquo;Infinite Regeneration&rsquo;. By doing so, I was forcibly taking in the energy that I had eaten. It would have been much easier to discard it, but that was not possible. If I didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; the magicules properly, I might damage Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was very troublesome, but this was the best process. This conclusion was made after consulting with Ciel, so all that remained was to repeat the whole process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I abandoned my thoughts and continued working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time was running out, but the target was huge. I was worried that I might not be able to finish in time, but I believed in Ciel. We would make it in time.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Since I was free, I&rsquo;ve been doing some analysis work in my spare time, would you like to hear about it?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just now, what do you mean that you were free?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What have you been doing while I&rsquo;ve been in pain?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;What I was doing was the &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; of Velgrynd&rsquo;s abilities. I studied the &lsquo;Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo; isolated in the &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo; and figured out its laws.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no, no, I wasn&rsquo;t asking a question&mdash;huh, you figured it out?!</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Although I failed to recreate the power, it is possible to develop a similar technique.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s ridiculous, Ciel. Those were from the surface of my thoughts, but I suppose I should assume it was always being read. Let&rsquo;s be mindful of the mental boundary and think about stuff on the deeper level of my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyway, it&rsquo;s amazing that it can copy Velgrynd&rsquo;s sure-kill technique. An Ultimate Skill should be impossible to reproduce just by looking at it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">No, wait? What else were you analyzing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I got scared and decided to ask it outright, &lsaquo;What else did you analyze?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Ciel replied as if it had been waiting for me a long time.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Yes! The analysis of &lsquo;Storm Blast&rsquo; has also been completed. It is possible to use the ability by using the remainder of &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wait, wait! The pain I&rsquo;m feeling right now was blown away by the seriousness of this report! It&rsquo;s hard to believe that you could complete such a difficult degree of analysis in your spare time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No, it&rsquo;s true. And these are not important, the main point is what follows!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I unconsciously reacted on the surface level of my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;s fine. There was no point in hiding it anyway. I mean, it made sense when I thought about it. I did have the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo; left. If I used it, it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if I could recreate the &lsquo;Storm Blast&rsquo;. It was awesome to be able to use a powerful ability, and to be honest, I was happy. That&rsquo;s why I was surprised, but it didn&rsquo;t seem strange to Ciel. Thinking about it that way, I was more concerned about what Ciel actually thought was important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What is the main point?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Regarding the &lsquo;Predated&rsquo; energy of the Storm Dragon earlier, I have successfully analyzed it. It is now possible to transform the body composition of my lord into the same species as &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo; Veldora. Do you wish to proceed?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What? Just now, didn&rsquo;t you just casually say something very disturbing? Transforming my body composition into the same kind as Veldora&rsquo;s?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Do I wish to proceed? What the hell!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m a little confused. If my understanding is correct, that would mean I would become a True Dragon&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;That understanding is correct.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Huuuh?! Correct&mdash;you say?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;Are you for real?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Of course! So, do you wish to evolve into a True Dragon?

Including pain, heat, and suffering. The new me was immune to the Storm Dragon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dragon Spirit Haki&rsquo;. It was because I could now use &lsquo;Dragon Spirit Haki&rsquo; as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, the more I ate, the more energy I would gain. My magicule count was increasing rapidly. The rate of increase was so high that I was worried that it would expand beyond control and run rampant.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No problem. I will manage it perfectly.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure you will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Ciel, there was no need to worry about that. Now that I was a True Dragon, my magicule count was finally in line with Veldora&rsquo;s. And I would break through the limit. Here I am, reborn as a new &lsquo;True Dragon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the time when this situation was left unattended, there was a fatal delay in the response of the Storm Dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You have won, Rimuru. I&rsquo;m surprised that you&rsquo;ve become a True Dragon, but I guess I was right about you all along. Kuahahaha!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora boasted of victory, not really sounding surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I raised you&rsquo;&mdash;he seemed to say, but it goes without saying that Veldora-san was not useful. Besides, it was too early to feel victorious. What was important was Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">, and its whereabouts were still unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I decided to put on the finishing touches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s finish this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t allow you to call yourself my favorite &ldquo;Storm Dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Devour all, &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth!&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In obedience to my command, the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; devoured the &lsquo;Storm Dragon.&rsquo; With pleasure. And with tremendous speed. Unlike before, the progression was one-sided. The devourer and the devoured. It was as if to embody &ldquo;the weak are meat the strong eat&rdquo;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The curtain had fallen quietly on the epic battle without a sound. An evolution and a new birth had occurred, leading to a further destination. The residue of the leaked energy filled the surrounding area with a light so bright that was difficult to see. It was like the light of blessing. A light celebrating the birth of a new &ldquo;type.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It was the light emitted by my old body, which had not transformed into a &ldquo;True Dragon,&rdquo; as it was converted into pure energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even this residue became my food and disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, I achieved my goal in flawless form.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Veldora was gone. The slime&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;had eaten him, Velgrynd realized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the investigation, Rimuru had been born from the magicule pool that leaked from Veldora. And yet, Rimuru devoured all of the Storm Dragon, his parent, and transformed himself into the fifth True Dragon&mdash;Ultimate Slime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Immediately after, the slime began to take human form. He had a single sword in his hand and not a scrap of clothing. He looked around 15 to 16 years old. At a height of only 160 centimeters or so, it was not an exaggeration to say that he was of small stature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the amount of magicule contained within him was not only comparable to Veldora&rsquo;s, but it also surpassed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His golden eyes were large and beautiful, as if they could see through everything. His silvery hair was lightly tinged with light blue, giving off a moonlit glow. He had no gender, and his face was more dainty than beautiful. However, the divine presence that he gave off was sublimely transformed into beauty. His dazzling white skin was cloaked in an aura of black and gold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Rimuru seemed to whisper something in displeasure, and the aura that covered his body transformed into divine jet-black, full-body garments. With &lsquo;Matter Creation,&rsquo; a specialty of the demons, he had materialized the garments. Even with the magicules leaking from his body were used, there was no telling how strong the armor was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru perfectly suppressed his excess energy in an instant. Then he grinned in satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd witnessed all of this from inside her prison. The transfer of energy had also been interrupted. She was completely stunned, unable to believe what she was seeing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle between her brother, the Storm Dragon Veldora, and the demon lord Rimuru, should have been overwhelmingly in Veldora&rsquo;s favor. There was absolutely no way that Veldora could lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that were possible, then they would have had to be equals from the start&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">A coincidence? It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;was that slime really just born there by chance?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sinking into a sea of thoughts, Velgrynd arrived at the astonishing conclusion. However, she could not admit it so easily. It was only natural. A monster being born in the vicinity of a True Dragon with a &lsquo;soul&rsquo; that could adapt to the Dragon Factor&mdash;there was no way that could happen by chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he were indeed the fifth True Dragon, he could be considered a younger brother. However, Rimuru ate Veldora and evolved into a True Dragon. Velgrynd could not accept that such a being could be called a True Dragon. He was something similar to a True Dragon, so to speak. She could not and would not accept such a horrible existence. He needed to be exterminated here and now&mdash;Velgrynd&rsquo;s instincts told her so. That would be the only way to avenge her younger brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To Velgrynd, Veldora was her cute little brother. He was cocky, rambunctious, and very difficult to deal with, but she envied his freedom. She had intended to use him as a pawn, but that was only a few years in the long life of a dragon. She had no intention of wiping him out, and she had intended to release him once she was done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment Velgrynd realized that Veldora had been devoured before her eyes, she felt her sanity blown away by anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you&hellip;devour my cute little brother!!&rdquo; Velgrynd roared in anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two hundred seconds had passed, and the &lsquo;Insulation Prison&rsquo; shattered. The Scorch Dragon, now without reason and without regard for her own self-preservation, unleashed her hostility towards Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

The species seems to be called &lsquo;Ultimate Slime,&rsquo; but with this, I am now a member of the True Dragon race&mdash;although, it&rsquo;s a subspecies. I guess I&rsquo;m not related to slimes anymore, but I kept that thought a secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s already done now, so no point in thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I checked my new body. The main body that could be created without consuming magicules had grown considerably. Or rather, should I say I had grown up? Now I was about as tall as a high school student. A girl, though&hellip; Actually, that didn&rsquo;t really mean much because my apparent age could be changed as I liked. I just thought it was interesting to see myself grow up like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing was whether I could relax and work or not. The volume of my slime form also increased, and it seemed to be around 70 to 80 centimeters in diameter. This was too big to be held, so I wanted to keep it small somehow. I&rsquo;d check on that later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, there was a problem. I wasn&rsquo;t wearing anything at the moment. In other words, I was naked. That was not good. Although my weird youki was leaking out and hiding my body, it still was ethically unpleasant for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why I made some clothes. I tried the &lsquo;Matter Creation&rsquo;, which Diablo had taught me, and it worked surprisingly easily. I was told that the performance of the garment would be quite good, depending on the ability of the maker. It was very comfortable to wear, and the jet-black clothes looked cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the grade I was curious about&hellip; It was mythical-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wah? Mythical-grade? Mythical-grade, huh? I see&mdash;wait, what?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be completely amazed was exactly how I felt at the moment. It truly felt like I had evolved, but I see. Perhaps, my current power was even greater than I had imagined. Thinking about it, there were a few things that came to mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru and the others had evolved into awakened demon lords, and their power was returned to me by the &lsquo;Food Chain&rsquo;, so that was probably one of the reasons. Another reason might be that I ate Veldora and took in his power. It was also certain that the unusable energy that had been stored in my &lsquo;Stomach&rsquo; had been analyzed and made usable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For these various reasons, I felt like they all came together and blossomed all at once. This was the result of everything working well together. In short, it was all thanks to Ciel. No, it would be rude to drop the honorifics here. Out of respect for my partner, I shall call you Ciel-sensei!</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Please stop.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I heard that, but I didn&rsquo;t care. Really, sensei was brilliant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll be relying on you from now on!</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Leave it to me!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmhmm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that I was dressed, I wouldn&rsquo;t forget my goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Veldora, are you okay?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kuahahaha! Of course, don&rsquo;t make me repeat myself. More importantly, I&rsquo;m amazed that you successfully managed to defeat my body!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Well, yeah. Looking back on it, I lost control a little. But still, I&rsquo;m relieved. Really!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veldora and I rejoiced in each other&rsquo;s safety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since we were able to converse like this, it appeared that Veldora&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2">heart</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was safe. Now all that was left was to connect the Soul Corridor and restore the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Successful without any problems.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s my Ciel-sensei. Even if I don&rsquo;t say anything, it&rsquo;s always working for me. It was a perfect job this time as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right. I had accomplished my goal. Now that Veldora was back, I had no business with the Imperial Army. However, my anger was still alive and well, and I intended to take it out on Emperor Rudra. Besides, ending the war half-heartedly would lead to future disasters. Now that we had come this far, we had to be thorough. It was my duty as a king to eliminate the threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that my anger had subsided, I was beginning to think that it was okay to leave all but Rudra alone, but I would do my job to the end without being distracted. Besides, even if I were willing to give in, there would be times when my enemies wouldn&rsquo;t keep silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As proof of this&mdash;I saw Velgrynd still alive and well, staring daggers at me from her prison cell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I succeeded in freeing Veldora, but for some reason Velgrynd had become furious. There was no point in trying to defeat her, so I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to deal with her, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The threat had to be eliminated.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Velgrynd is no longer a threat. Although the analysis of all her powers is not yet complete, the countermeasures are perfect.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel-sensei&rsquo;s confidence was amazing. Or was it pride?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;No, it is a hard fact.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be ridiculous if we lost, but I guess we wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about that. Even in the previous fight it had completely blocked Velgrynd&rsquo;s attacks. The current Ciel should be able to subdue her without much trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, there was no change in our plan of taking this opportunity to hit the Empire thoroughly. I intended to finish them off right here, without leaving even a single drop of blood. As of now, the Black Numbers were on the rampage. There were several large whirlpools in the battlefield, and it appeared that there were no significant players left. If I was aiming for Rudra, I would collide with her anyway, so it was tactically correct to deal a blow to Velgrynd here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire had Lieutenant Kondou and Damrada. The four knights guarding Rudra were also very troublesome opponents. Yuuki was also being controlled by Rudra and had to be dealt with as an enemy. In addition, there should be one more Single Digit left. I didn&rsquo;t know what he or she looked like, but since this soldier was likely at the &lsquo;Saint&rsquo; level, we needed to be careful. In other words, even if we exclude Rudra and Velgrynd, there were still eight strong enemies left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judging by the signs on the battlefield, it seemed that there were a few others who could be considered &ldquo;threats,&rdquo; so I would deal with them all right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be perfectly honest, even those powerful people didn&rsquo;t feel like much of a threat to me right now. This was because the amount of magicules in me had increased nearly tenfold since I had evolved into a True Dragon. As a result, the quality and quantity of my powers had been greatly enhanced, and I felt that I was much stronger than before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since I hadn&rsquo;t released Veldora yet, I was at full energy. I was in great shape, and I felt like I could give Milim and Guy a run for their money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t be too conceited. If I get carried away like that, I will surely fail. Let&rsquo;s just keep our guard up and act with caution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the way, while looking for signs of warfare, I noticed that the powerful opponents I had just mentioned were already engaged with Benimaru and the others. I was the one who had given the order, but I was still impressed by their quick actions. At the same time, I was worried about the possible casualties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Were they obeying my orders not to die?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hoped that they didn&rsquo;t act recklessly just to keep everyone out of my way&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, I could worry about that later. Right before me was Velgrynd, who looked like she was about to jump me. I would deal with her first, and then decide whether or not to go help them.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In less than a second, I made that decision. Then, the next question was how to fight her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, how about using the &lsquo;Storm Dragon Release&rsquo; of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo;? With this, I could summon Veldora and take on Velgrynd in a two-on-one battle. That way, victory would be assured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come to think of it, it seems that my magicule capacity was not always full. It was probably because I had been letting Veldora run free. Veldora and I were like one and the same, and if one of us was safe, we could revive each other without any problem. It was different from Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;, but that cheat-like invincibility was noteworthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I thought about that as the price to pay, the magicule burden was not a problem. Besides, the surplus of magicules from Veldora was flowing into me, so I did not feel inconvenienced that much. In fact, the circulatory effect had revitalized my body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, although the &lsquo;Storm Dragon Release&rsquo; had some disadvantages, the advantages were far greater. It used to consume about 90 percent of my magicules, but now the burden appeared to be about 30 percent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that in mind, I attempted to activate the &lsquo;Storm Dragon Release&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you&hellip; My cute little brother!!&rdquo; Velgrynd shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From my perspective, this was a misplaced anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the one who struck first?! You guys were the ones who tried to get me to fight Veldora in the first place!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up! Veldora couldn&rsquo;t have been eaten by someone like you!! Although he wasn&rsquo;t all great, I never thought he could fall behind a demon lord&hellip; I will never accept that he disappeared because of this. I will never forgive you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enraged Velgrynd recklessly unleashed a heat ray (Blaster) at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t work on me. But, well, this is what I learned from that conversation. I thought she was angry, but it was because I had eaten Veldora. She thought I had killed him and wiped him out completely. In that case, the answer is simple. &lsquo;Storm Dragon Release&rsquo; will clear up all the misunderstanding. And yet:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Gawawawah! W-wait, Rimuru!&rsaquo; Veldora, the person in question, stopped me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsaquo; I asked, worried&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Listen, Rimuru. My sister is furious right now because she thinks I&rsquo;m gone. Is that right?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yeah, she is. So why don&rsquo;t you come out and explain, and maybe we can avoid unnecessary conflict?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You idiot! Don&rsquo;t be crazy!! Showing that I&rsquo;m safe with that kind of timing will be too awkward. All of my sister&rsquo;s anger might turn to me!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a stupid answer. I felt like I&rsquo;d lost after listening to it seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was so shocked I thought I would stop breathing. When I heard Veldora saying that, I realized that I could not rely on him at all. But really&hellip;this person was useless at every critical moment, wasn&rsquo;t he? I felt like an idiot and was about to complain, but at that moment, Ciel also stopped me.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Please wait. In any case, this is an opportunity to optimize Veldora&rsquo;s powers. I have his permission, so please wait to execute &lsquo;Storm Dragon Release&rsquo; until after his Skill has been innovated.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tone was as clean and polite as ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel said that it would innovate Veldora&rsquo;s Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Investigation King Faust&rsquo; to evolve into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Chaos King Nyarlathotep&rsquo;. Since it was an &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;, it appeared that it would be terribly enhanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What caught my attention was the statement that permission had been given by the person himself. To my surprise, Ciel&rsquo;s existence was known to Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Since when?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;He was already aware of my existence just after Rimuru-sama evolved into a demon lord.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what Ciel-san said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I was aware, but I only became certain of it a short while ago. In the first place, I&rsquo;ve never heard of a mere Skill developing an ego in all of history. However, the power of the deadly sins system seemed to have something like an ego, so I began to wonder if it was possible.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Veldora, he had suspected something since the time of the Great Sage. He said he had been observing things from inside my Stomach, and there had been a lot of strange phenomena from time to time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the Great Sage became the &lsquo;Wisdom King Raphael&rsquo; due to my demon lord evolution, he felt that his suspicions were almost certain. He said that he had been talking with it before that, but he had thought that it was me he was talking to. Not that it bothered me, but I was curious about what kind of conversations they had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, Veldora was acquainted with Ciel. That&rsquo;s what was important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;In other words, you two knew each other. And you agreed to Ciel&rsquo;s proposal, is that correct?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right! As much as I would love to deal with my sister, I cannot do so because of these circumstances. Sorry Rimuru, but I&rsquo;ll leave it to you!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hey, you&rsquo;re exploiting the situation. That&rsquo;s not what you were saying earlier!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could have shouted at him, but I still felt sorry for him, so I stopped. Ciel also seemed like it wanted to play with Veldora&rsquo;s Skill. Even though I thought there was no need to do it now, it might be more troublesome to do after he was released.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, I also wanted to test my own strength. I thought it was necessary to know how strong I was if I had to deal with Rudra after this. Velgrynd would be just the right opponent. The current me could fight with a bit of leeway, so I would be able to see how much I had grown in various ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was time. I would keep an eye on my friends, but until they were in danger, I would prioritize testing my Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel seemed very happy, somehow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was motivated to fight with that in mind, but it also suggested something to me as a side note.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;By the way, as a result of various analyses, it is possible to combine the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Storm King Veldora&rsquo; and &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; to create the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Stellar Wind King Hastur&rsquo;. Should it be implemented?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel-sensei, you don&rsquo;t seem to have the slightest intention of restraining yourself&hellip; Just how much room do you think I have to spare when I&rsquo;m about to fight Velgrynd right now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I have no interest in Velgrynd anymore&rsquo;&mdash;it was practically saying that out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems to enjoy modifying Skills as a hobby, but I would have preferred to do that in times of peace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the time being, it is rejected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You might be able to find a better way to improve it, right? So be careful for now and think about it slowly later!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;!! As expected of Master. Understood. I will continue my search for greater heights.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mm-hmm. I&rsquo;m glad to hear it&rsquo;s convinced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t quite know what it meant by &ldquo;as expected of Master&rdquo;, but at least now I could concentrate on fighting. The &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; was effective against Velgrynd. There was no way I was going to give up that advantage here, no matter how much I had the upper hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, I probably could have won with only the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth,&rsquo; But this was not a game, and I couldn&rsquo;t let my guard down. Even in an unlikely event, there was no room for failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I understood that Ciel thought very highly of me, so I would just ignore its flattery. Still, Ciel&rsquo;s enthusiasm for modding Skills was disturbing. Veldora was its current victim, but that was okay because he wanted it too. The problem, however, was what would happen after this battle was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had a feeling that my friends who had awakened as demon lords would have to undergo some major Skill modifications as well. Ciel-sensei would probably be able to strengthen them as well. I had a feeling that it was waiting vigilantly for an opportunity to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps it had already&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I was thinking about this, the time to settle the score with Velgrynd had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

As soon as Velgrynd changed into her human form, the battle began instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While firing a series of Nuclear Cannons at me, she slashed at me with her &lsquo;Blue Dragon Sword&rsquo;.</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what was the difference between human form and Dragon Mode? To put it simply, it came down to the difference in defense power. The attack power was exactly the same. The energy efficiency of the human form was far superior. Since the ability to continue the battle would increase accordingly, it could be said that the human form was more suitable for long-term battles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the Dragon Mode also had a considerable advantage. That was the fact that it was massive in size. The scale of the attack increased with the size of the body. The power would remain the same, but the range of the attack increased. This meant that the dragon form would be able to take on multiple enemies at the same time. It went without saying that even if the enemy was a single person, it would be difficult to evade all attacks unleashed from a large body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there was the defensive aspect. This was its true value. To kill a massive body, one needed a large-scale attack to match it. That was difficult to defeat with a sword, and even most magic was useless in terms of that scale. To begin with, there were few spells that could even be used against a True Dragon, but even if that was ignored, there was still no point in using single-target spells. Only a spell with a wide enough range could do much damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why, if anything, the Dragon Mode was stronger&hellip;however, Velgrynd had chosen to take her human form. Her intentions were probably to&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;It is presumed that she has abandoned her defenses to take down Master with certainty.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s about what it seemed like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that was the case, I would fight with that assumption as well. The murderous expression on Velgrynd&rsquo;s face enhanced her beauty. That murderous aura was imbued in her blade as she swung it down with a force that could cut me in half.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t intend to take it lying down. Leaving Ciel to deal with the magic, I intercepted Velgrynd with my favorite sword&mdash;the hihiirokane straight sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s Blue Dragon Sword was a type of broadsword. She was not hiding it before, but it was a weapon that Velgrynd had created with &lsquo;Matter Creation&rsquo;. Its grade was comparable to mythical-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My sword, on the other hand, had reached mythical-grade, perhaps in sync with my becoming a True Dragon. Velgrynd&rsquo;s Blue Dragon Sword was a threat, but my weapon would not be defeated either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the contrary:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Chiiing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">W</span><span class="c1">ith a high-pitched sound, Velgrynd&rsquo;s Blue Dragon Sword snapped and shattered. I was surprised, but Velgrynd must have been even more so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; she demanded, after leaping away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hadn&rsquo;t meant to do anything; I was simply taking the attack. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t know what I did either.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;It was the difference in weapon performance. While Master&rsquo;s straight sword is a masterpiece forged by Kurobee with all his heart and soul, Velgrynd&rsquo;s Blue Dragon Sword is a mass-produced product simply made of condensed magicules. The density of the magicules is so great that it is equivalent to a mythical-grade sword, but it is essentially a dull sword by nature.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is that so?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I knew there were varying levels of quality within the same grade, but I didn&rsquo;t think that there would be this much difference within the mythical-grade. Sure enough, it was one&rsquo;s familiar equipment that could be relied upon. I was glad to find out about this. After all, even my clothes had been created by &lsquo;Matter Creation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was safer not to expect too much from something just because it was mythical-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It just became clear to me now, but there seems to be a world of difference in performance between even the same grade levels. The weapons you create are no match for my sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d give up now, but I still told her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was by no means a fool, so she seemed to see that I was not lying. However, she still seemed unconvinced, as several times after that, she produced her Blue Dragon Sword and slashed at me. I smashed through all of them. Finally, Velgrynd seemed to have accepted the reality. She glared at me in frustration and immediately moved on to her next attack. If her manifested weapons were no good, then she would have to rely on her own body. Velgrynd&rsquo;s claws extended, and she took a stance similar to that in Chinese martial arts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing that, I put my sword away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An experiment, of course. I wanted to see how much I&rsquo;d grown, so I stopped relying on my sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Using a weapon would feel like I was bullying a weakling, so I&rsquo;ll take you on with my bare hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s a fight without a little trash talk? If I could make her lose her composure, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be too much to say that the victory was won at that point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a fool of me!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It worked. It was almost funny how easily Velgrynd fell into my trap. All I had to do now was play my cards right to seal the deal</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s claw attacks were fast. It was impossible to follow them with your eyes. But my current perception speed was extraordinary. Since the name &ldquo;Ciel&rdquo; was given to Wisdom King Raphael-san, my &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; had been increasing. It had been a million times faster than normal, but now it was several hundred million times faster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Surprisingly, even the speed of light could be recognized. That said, even if I could recognize it, it did not mean that I could move at that speed. That must not be misunderstood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that wasn&rsquo;t to say that there were no ways around it. In addition to the activation of magic, the activation of &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; had become almost a thousand times faster. In other words, if the distance between me and the attacker was a certain distance, it was now possible to escape from a light-speed attack with &lsquo;transport&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A second was stretched out to over a decade, and it felt like seeing the world at a complete stand still. The inability to move for such a long time could not have been endured by a normal person&rsquo;s ego, but Ciel had smoothly solved this problem by activating &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; during the key points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t matter to me how fast Velgrynd could move. At this point, I didn&rsquo;t need any swordplay or physical skills, and could push through with brute force alone. Velgrynd&rsquo;s superspeed attack was approaching. Its speed was several hundred times the speed of sound, and the old me would have had a hard time with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, however, it was no problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Too slow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While provoking Velgrynd with that, I &lsquo;Transported&rsquo; behind her. However, Velgrynd was no slouch. Perhaps she had anticipated my actions, and she reacted immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, I thought she was tough. After all, one couldn&rsquo;t be too careful against one of the strongest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I knew it. I didn&rsquo;t think you could move faster than me, so you were using &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s amazing that you can transport so naturally without distorting space, but it can be dealt with if I know the source.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought she would be furious at my provocation, but she was much calmer than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected of Veldora-san&rsquo;s sister&hellip; This was also as Ciel had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd&rsquo;s next move would be to&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I interfere with the space and lock it, you will not be able to transport in my area of control. That&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, that was the only thing she could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, Velgrynd also possessed &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; and was able to interfere with a wide area of space around herself. If Velgrynd did this, I would not be able to use &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; to transport.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t entirely impossible if I forced myself, but it would be useless if the location were exposed. It could also be used to escape, but since the destination of escape would be revealed, it would be meaningless in the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once the transportation Skills were blocked like this, physical speed would determine the battle. For Velgrynd, this created a winning environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why her next move would be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d have to use my trump card against someone like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;ve won just by blocking transportation? If so, I&rsquo;ll have to show you that you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really </span><span class="c1 c2">are</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cocky. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that kid&rsquo;s revenge, I wouldn&rsquo;t have hated you. But this is it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd took her stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kicked off the air, turning herself into a bullet at supersonic speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The speed increased even further&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Scorch Dragon &lsquo;Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice echoed across the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd herself became a crimson meteor, closing in on me at the physical speed limit of sub-light speed. Moreover, the meteor bullet could change its orbit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By transforming her own body into a meteor bullet, Velgrynd had achieved the ability to change her trajectory at will. Or rather, this was the true nature of the Scorch Dragon &lsquo;Cardinal Acceleration&rsquo;. Not simply a straight-line attack, but a tracking attack with the ability to shift directions freely. It was the ultimate destructive attack, possessing not only energy waves but also mass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ciel-sensei had analyzed the Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration and had perfectly seen through its essence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was terrifying, but Ciel-sensei was even more terrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that I had created a Manas named Ciel on a whim would be the cause of Velgrynd&rsquo;s defeat.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;As planned, the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; is deployed all around Master. No matter the direction of contact, there will be no problem with Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Predation&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s exactly what it said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if I tried to eat the target normally, the resistance of a willful being was a lot. On top of that, I was dealing with a True Dragon. No matter how hard Ciel tried, &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; with the &lsquo;Gluttonous King Beelzebuth&rsquo; was impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd, of her own volition, turned her body into a meteor bullet. By putting all of her energy into attacking, she had greatly reduced her resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the result of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was now isolated in my &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;How is this possible?! Why, what just happened?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment she thought she had finished me off, she was suddenly sent into an empty space. It would be difficult for Velgrynd to grasp the current situation. It would take her a while to realize that she had lost. That&rsquo;s why I would tell her directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;ve won. You just stay where you are.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;&hellip;I, I-I&rsquo;ve lost?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s right. You won&rsquo;t be able to escape my &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo;, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible for you to transfer energy even with your &lsquo;Parallel Existence.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the amount of Velgrynd&rsquo;s magicules I had eaten, Ciel-sensei said it was more than 50 percent. The &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; on Rudra&rsquo;s side was at about 20 percent, and the remaining 30 percent or so was being restored. It seems that her body could only recover about 10 percent a day, so it should be possible to get back to 50 percent in about three days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, because I still had the &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; inside me, I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d be able to recover that much. It was complicated because her ego existed on both sides, but there was no doubt that Velgrynd had been weakened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Just ask Veldora for the details.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ask Veldora? What are you talking about&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd looked confused, but it would be quicker to hear it from his own mouth than from me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kuahahaha! Sister, it&rsquo;s me. You seem to be in a not-so-good mood.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Veldora?! You, didn&rsquo;t you disappear?!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, I would let the siblings talk things over and settle down in a calm environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, I had won a complete victory over Velgrynd, and succeeded in capturing most of her magicules in the &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, with the birth of my reliable partner Ciel, the reckless challenge of taking on two &ldquo;True Dragons&rdquo; at the same time ended more perfectly than ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c30" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c32 c14 c22 c17">Chapter 3</span></h2><p class="c24 c47"><span class="c13 c21">The Intensifying Battlefield</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">The 30,000 members of the Magic Beast Corps, led by General Gladium, flew into the sky from the airship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing the gallant figure of Velgrynd, their morale was high. The enemies below them would make the perfect targets for their violent impulses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen up, men! His Majesty and Velgrynd-sama will see what you do here. You must perform well, so bring out your fighting spirit and don&rsquo;t act like fools!&rdquo; Gladium shouted, and his soldiers responded with an air-shaking roar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was pleased with that. This was the perfect opportunity, he thought while smiling inwardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Kukuku. Even if I give up on taking over the world, there is no doubt that my time will come. Calgurio has been defeated and that Yuuki kid has fallen. I am the only one left, leaving me as the only general. As long as I make my military mark here, I will get what I want!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Gladium&rsquo;s perspective, the Western Nations were not much of an enemy. Hinata Sakaguchi seemed to be a formidable opponent, but Gladium only saw her as a half-wit who could only come to a draw with a new demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was a confident, aggressive fighter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was the second most powerful man in the Empire, the &ldquo;Beast King&rdquo; Gladium. His origins, as the rumor had it, were in the Beast Kingdom of Eurazania. In fact, Gladium was the half-brother of the &ldquo;Beast Master&rdquo; Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The beast that dwelled within Gladium was a solitary white tiger. He had a history of being too selfish and was judged unworthy to be a king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Those scum!! They aren&rsquo;t even in the position to be in the same room as me, yet they dare side with Karion and plot a rebellion against me. I&rsquo;ll make sure to get my revenge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium had been harboring hatred for many years. It had turned into outright resentment by this point. The previous king of Eurazania was not a great warrior, but he had a good eye for people. He had made his decision based on his discernment of which of the two brothers was more worthy to lead Eurazania&rsquo;s people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing his decision, Gladium was furious. He had attempted to subjugate the former king, and although he succeeded in killing his own father, he was later banished by Karion and the Beastketeers of the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rebellion was nothing more than Gladium&rsquo;s selfish belief, but the truth was quite the opposite. The fact that Gladium had survived was proof of his strength. He was a heretic of the beastmen tribe, and if his character had been decent, he could have become a mighty warrior capable of defeating Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was just an assumption. Gladium had fled and wandered around the world. The people he met while doing so were now the three generals who were currently Gladium&rsquo;s loyal subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Suzaku (Vermillion Bird)&rdquo; Nazim. She was a mutant of the harpy tribe that Gladium had met while wandering near the Harpy Nation Fulbrosia. Her wings were gray with purple spots, and there were three pairs. In return for her loss of reproductive ability, she possessed outstanding fighting power. Gladium took a liking to her beauty, which was similar to Frey&rsquo;s, and brought her into his group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seiryuu (Azure Dragon)&rdquo; Baraga. Baraga&rsquo;s partner was a Water Dragon, an archdragon who had been defeated by Gladium. He was a warrior in his prime, and his ability was in the middle of the ranks of the Imperial Knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Genbu (Black Tortoise)&rdquo; Gozarin.</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c1 c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A girl with a rare monster, Lorelei</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c1">. She was a priestess of a foreign race and was skilled in various magic arts. After Gladium had defeated Lorelei, she began to follow him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three generals had different stories, but they all had one thing in common&mdash;they were strong. Nazim, for example, was a Demon Lord Seed and could be awakened at any moment. Baraga and Gozarin&rsquo;s monsters were also Calamity-class and had outstanding strength among the &lsquo;Magic Beast Corps&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was about three hundred years ago that Gladium had taken refuge in the Empire. It happened after Veldora had been sealed away. He had survived the Tenma Great War and idiotically led his violent group in a rampage through the Empire&rsquo;s territory. He was defeated by the Imperial Army and pardoned for his strength by promising to obey Emperor Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium&rsquo;s ambition was to defeat the Marshal and become number one in the Empire. Then, once the opportunity presented itself, he would rebel against Rudra and take his place. Gladium had no auspicious intentions to repay the favor given to him. He only followed the other party because they were strong, and he was vigilantly waiting for an opportunity to betray them at any moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the help of the Empire, he would rule the world. And one day, he would reign as the emperor himself. It was a reckless dream, for he did not know just who the &ldquo;Marshal&rdquo; was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra and the others had long been aware of Gladium&rsquo;s true nature. But as long as he was strong enough to be useful and obeyed orders, it was fine to keep him alive. The dangerous balance of mutual exploitation was made possible when the intentions of both parties were balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, that balance had fallen apart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">No way. I never thought that the &ldquo;Marshal&rdquo; would be the Scorch Dragon Velgrynd. It&rsquo;s impossible to defeat that kind of existence. It&rsquo;s a terrifying existence that is far beyond my reach at this moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was truly an existence of a different dimension. It was a stroke of luck that he realized this before his rebellion to kill the emperor. Gladium thanked the god he didn&rsquo;t even believe in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium had changed his mindset. He knew that if he wanted to become emperor, Velgrynd was someone he must defeat at some point, but it would require careful preparation. Understanding this, he would devote himself to earning credit for his achievements for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, this was a good situation for them. Gladium&rsquo;s bestial instincts told him that he was close to awakening. He knew intuitively that he was almost ready to gain great power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same was true for Nazim, who had always fought with him. Although the conditions for the awakening were not clear, the time was near. This was one of the reasons why Gladium had sought out the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, in front of Gladium, there was the perfect crowd of fodder. How could he not be pleased with this situation? Gladium licked his lips. Looking around the battlefield, there were many enemies who seemed to have great power. The more of them they defeated, the more powerful Gladium&rsquo;s group would become.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukukuku, the party is about to begin!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Gladium had hoped&mdash;no, wished with all this heart&mdash;the battlefield would soon become more intense.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Their gazes sought and found powerful opponents.</span></p><p class="c10 c45"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, that&rsquo;s King Gazel. If I defeat him, that will do wonders for my reputation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, are you trying to get ahead of everyone? If you don&rsquo;t leave something good for Gladium-sama, he&rsquo;ll be pissed, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">King Gazel&rsquo;s bravery was widely known, and defeating him would certainly put him in a good light. As a warrior, Baraga&rsquo;s heart was racing. Nazim was the one who calmed him down. He knew that Gladium was targeting King Gazel and advised Baraga to make concessions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">If he defeats Gazel, Gladium-sama&rsquo;s power will surely increase. This is too good a situation to pass up!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was also Nazim&rsquo;s true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Baraga, his main priority was also Gladium, his master. In the first place, Gazel was a wounded man and there was a risk of being accused of cowardice as a warrior. In this way, it would be best to take out a more appropriate enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand. I hope that Gladium-sama will devour King Gazel and become stronger,&rdquo; Baraga said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kishishishi. Rest assured,&rdquo; Gozarin said with a smile. &ldquo;There are many other powerful opponents here. It&rsquo;s a little unsatisfactory, but it may be enough to fill your stomach.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As was said, there were many strong people on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga nodded, not in a hurry. Nazim also smiled and agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ufufu. As Gladium-sama says, the time of awakening is near. The first one to become a True Demon Lord will be me. The &lsquo;Vermillion Bird&rsquo; Nazim!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nazim-dono, aren&rsquo;t you the one who&rsquo;s trying to get ahead?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, calm down now. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all thinking the same thing. Let&rsquo;s leave that King Gazel to Gladium-sama, and we will do as we please!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words spoke for everyone&rsquo;s feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll take that weak lizard. He seems to be the leader of the dragonewt group who still seem to be very active and troublesome, so I&rsquo;d like to strike him first to crush their fighting spirit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;ll go with the cocky woman over there. I&rsquo;ll have to teach her a lesson about flying in the air without my permission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kishishishi. Then I will destroy that golem. I&rsquo;ll let him taste the full power of Lorelei!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One by one, the three generals made their declarations so that no one&rsquo;s prey was snatched. Then the three generals flew towards their respective prey. However, this shallow plan would prove to be na&iuml;ve.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium&rsquo;s target was Gazel, as his three generals had predicted. It was only natural. Whether or not to target the strong first depended on the situation, but it was common sense to first deal with a strong foe who had been weakened. Gazel could not move because he had been hit by Kondou. Now was the best chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You must be King Gazel. My name is Gladium. General Gladium, commander of the Empire&rsquo;s most powerful Magic Beast Corps! I shall take your head!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no hesitation or humility, it was just downright low. But this behavior was justified for Gladium. It was his sincere conviction that one should use any means necessary to achieve your goal. And so, Gladium swooped down towards King Gazel, but someone stood in his way. It was a dragonewt with reddish-purple scales that sparked with purple lightning&mdash;the &ldquo;Draco Lord&rdquo; Gabil, who he thought had been defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! I am back!! Your disrespect for King Gazel shall not be overlooked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, so you dare to interfere with me? Damn lizard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was displeased to have been disrupted by his prey. However, he soon got flustered, realizing that this was not the time to be thinking that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Gladium looked over at his three generals, wondering what they were doing, he was met with a startling sight. The &ldquo;Azure Dragon&rdquo; Baraga, who was supposed to be Gabil&rsquo;s opponent, had been defeated in a single blow from the recovered Gabil. The &ldquo;Black Tortoise&rdquo; Gozarin, who had headed for the Demon Colossus with high spirits, was in tears after Lorelei had been crushed. The only one left was &ldquo;Vermillion Bird&rdquo; Nazim, who was fighting on equal terms with Souka, whom she had identified as an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even when the soldiers had challenged Gabil in order to defend Gladium, the difference in their strengths was obvious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no choice, so Gladium tried to move forward himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, however, Major General Zamud sent an urgent &ldquo;Magic Communication.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I-it&rsquo;s an emergency! Demon Lord Rimuru has committed an outrageous act over here. In order to ensure His Majesty&rsquo;s protection, please send reinforcements to us immediately!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was tempted to yell at him, but he managed to swallow his words. Then he inquired what had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;He drew a huge, a-an impossibly huge, Demon Summoning Gate&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What are you saying?!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;In other words, hundreds of greater demons and above were summoned! Moreover, they&rsquo;ve been incarnated. Their individual strengths are all above A rank, yet they&rsquo;re even acting as an organized group!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Zamud&rsquo;s flustered exclamation, he could tell that this was a serious situation. However, Gladium was not convinced. Demon Lord Rimuru may have done something ridiculous, but the Empire still had Velgrynd. She could not be defeated by any demon, and he didn&rsquo;t think this was that much of a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they were talking about threats, Gladium would rather concentrate his forces on the one in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Our side is also in the middle of something. I want you to take care of your own affairs.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spitting out the words, Gladium tried to end the call. However, Zamud&rsquo;s urgent voice stopped him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;But you must understand, there&rsquo;s a demon army of catastrophic scale that exceeds the strength of the Imperial Army&rsquo;s generals and soldiers!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;What are you talking about? You have not only Velgrynd-sama, but also the Imperial Guard on your side!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though there was only one flagship, the people on board were the Empire&rsquo;s most powerful battle force. Gladium believed that they could do whatever they wanted on their own, without having to rely on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only natural to think so, and no one would blame Gladium for it. But this time, the opponent was just too strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;It is true that we have Lieutenant Kondou and the Imperial Guard here. But we have our hands full dealing with the demon lord&rsquo;s army executives.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;The executives?!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be&rsquo;&mdash;was the thought that crossed Gladium&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for the identity of the opponent in front of him, he knew he was an executive by the name of Gabil, though it was a rough guess. That said, he had been surprised by the strength of the opponent, but now that he thought about it, he realized that there had been other executives named in the report.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, Shion, Diablo, Gobta. They were called the Four Heavenly Kings of Demon Lord Rimuru, yet Gabil&rsquo;s name was not listed among them. If that was the case, it meant that the Four Heavenly Kings were more powerful than Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s not all! Believe it or not, Demon Lord Rimuru has committed an abomination we could not have imagined. I don&rsquo;t know how he did it, but he evolved the demons!! Do you understand? Hundreds of demons have been enhanced to be as strong as archdemons!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was certainly an unrealistic story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium didn&rsquo;t want to believe it, but Major General Zamud was not a man who would joke about these things. On the contrary, he was a serious, meticulous person. In that case, it was true, and he had no choice but to believe that hundreds of Calamity-class enemies had been unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;I see. Zamud, I understand your concerns.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Ahh, then I&rsquo;m counting on you for reinforcements!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a sigh of relief, Zamud&rsquo;s call was cut off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium pondered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if they had greater numbers, it was meaningless if they were outclassed in quality. That was the rule of the battlefield, and it was why Gladium had trained his subordinates so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it was only the demons, they might still be able to get by. But now that two of the three generals had fallen, it was dangerous to think so optimistically. At the very least, Gladium&rsquo;s subordinates would just be waiting to be overrun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Tsk! Have I underestimated him as a mere demon lord and misjudged him? I and the upper echelons of the empire will survive, but the lowly soldiers will all be slaughtered in the end. In that case, I&rsquo;d rather&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too late for regrets. All he could do now was do what was within his power. And Gladium had a forbidden trick up his sleeve.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

They were of the bloodline of champions from the olden days and were a group of innately powerful people&mdash;That&rsquo;s what was said, but the truth was something else. They were a group of artificial champions, created by combining magic and knowledge of another world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magic beasts they tamed also had their own secrets. Not only were they selected to be of A-minus rank or higher, but by rewriting the information in their genes, they had been given abilities specialized for combat. A synthetic life form created by cultivating and increasing the number of magic beasts and integrating various characteristics into them. It was a kind of weapon called the Battle Chimera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium, a beastman, was also the director of these studies. He made the mechanism of his own transformation known and used it to strengthen his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this world, there was no such thing as research that was forbidden for ethical or religious reasons. Because of this, results were achieved at an astonishing rate. As a result of human experimentation using slaves, the strongest army that Gladium wanted was born. The A-ranked champions and their partners, the &lsquo;Battle Chimeras&rsquo;, were a fusion of man and monster, and boasted unparalleled strength. However, their true value had yet to be demonstrated&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The integration of different natures&mdash;that was Gladium&rsquo;s ultimate goal. For this purpose, a special prescription technique (Medical Skill), &lsquo;The Beast,&rsquo; was developed. The existence of this drug, which was the most important of his military secrets, was known only to Gladium&rsquo;s three generals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a wonder, and the effects were the culmination of all of the resources he had sunk into the experiment. It was a fusion of the magic beasts and the soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Based on the transformation of the beastmen race, &lsquo;The Beast&rsquo; sought the beast factor not from one&rsquo;s own body, but from one&rsquo;s partner, the Battle Chimera. In the truest sense of the word, the human and the beast fused, and a tremendous power developed in the body. It could create a super-warrior incomparable to any magic beast tamer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, as it was a forbidden drug that gave people the power of magic beasts, it was also very dangerous. Once the drug was administered, the Skill would be activated forcibly, and it was impossible to remove it on your own. It was only possible to remove the drug at the hospital attached to the institute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were also serious side effects that should not be forgotten. Rather, the side effects were the real problem, as the safety of the drug was not guaranteed. According to the current research results, the mortality rate was 40 percent. In some cases, the user would fail to adapt and would not be able to return from the magic beast. There was a 20 percent chance of this happening, in which case the person would never be able to live a human life again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worse than this, however, was the chance of going berserk. Some users were turned into magic beasts and went on a rampage, while others lost consciousness and disobeyed orders while maintaining their human form. When this happened, there was no choice but to dispose of them. There was also a 30 percent chance that this would happen. It was worse than dying, so it was not an easy thing to try. Those were the cases of complete failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In total, there was a 90 percent chance of failure. Taking the drug was tantamount to ordering someone to die, and even the selfish Gladium was hesitant to test this on his own people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium wanted to improve the quality of the drug and increase the success rate before letting his subordinates use it. However, that was not an option under these circumstances. At this rate, the weak would all be killed anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emperor Rudra was an even more cold-hearted man than Gladium. There was a part of him that believed the weak were nothing more than bait for the strong. If that was the case, letting them use the drug here was the only way to show them compassion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, those who would go berserk could be used as bait, and even if they could not return to human form, they were still valuable as a fighting force. The only real waste would be the 40 percent of soldiers who would die on the spot&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The outcome was uncertain, but there was no doubt that their forces would become more powerful than they were currently. In that case, it was the right thing to do. There were still many unknown factors about the effects of the drug, and physical abnormalities that might occur, but it was certain that 10 percent of the soldiers would become stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the battlefield, quality was more important than quantity. For those who knew this, the idea of strengthening 10 percent of the soldiers was a tempting one. In reality, the total success rate remained unknown. The number of trials was too small, and there was a risk of unexpected side effects due to physical abnormalities. Although such a possibility could not be ruled out, some of them had been able to harness the power of magic beasts and survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most successful of those who lived&mdash;less than 1 percent&mdash;had been confirmed to be fully compatible. They were hailed as Chimera Knights and the story about that success was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you guys. I just got a call from Zamud. Apparently, this is no longer a good time to play around. Get up quickly and take care of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium spoke very seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s face turned suspicious as he realized the words were not directed at him. However, he immediately tightened his expression and jumped away from his spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A moment later, a silver light pierced the area where he had just been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph, you dodged that one. I thought it was a perfect surprise attack, but it seems that you are still an opponent not to be trifled with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not to be trifled with? That&rsquo;s my line. How are you still in one piece after I put a big hole in your chest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil jumped back and was confronted by the supposedly dead &ldquo;Azure Dragon&rdquo; Baraga. There was still a hole in his chest, and there was no sign of &lsquo;Ultraspeed Regeneration&rsquo; or even &lsquo;Auto Regeneration&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A normal person would be dead by now, but this was a world full of dangerous majins. There was nothing too strange about what was happening. Gabil understood this, and he had made sure that the life-signs of his defeated opponents were gone. It was Baraga who was abnormal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kukuku. I am safe because Gladium-sama has given me great power. Let me show you who I really am!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if in response to Baraga&rsquo;s cry, a Water Dragon flew in. No! It was similar but not the same thing. It was a Battle Chimera that mimicked a water dragon. Baraga was one of the Chimera Knights who had awakened to his true power. If either his main body or his partner was safe, then he was safe. This was also one of the hidden powers of the Chimera Knights. And now, by activating the special Medical Skill &lsquo;The Beast,&rsquo; he was able to recover from his fatal wound in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Furthermore, as soon as Baraga and the water dragon came into contact with each other, they merged their bodies into one. Baraga&rsquo;s form remained unchanged, but dragon&rsquo;s scales appeared on his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The quality of his youki was different from before. There was no doubt that his strength had also increased substantially.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil glanced at Gladium in frustration, but decided that Baraga was now his enemy. He tried to focus on a single battle with Baraga&hellip;but Gladium was not so na&iuml;ve as to allow that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This lizard is stronger than expected. We&rsquo;ll kill him together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll take the vanguard. Gladium-sama, please provide support.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll help you, so don&rsquo;t skimp out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither honor nor chivalry were of any concern to Gladium. Having recognized Gabil&rsquo;s power, he would move to eliminate him without a second thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What nonsense! Even if the two of you come at me together, you won&rsquo;t be able to beat me!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil made a bold statement, inspiring himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, he faced a disadvantageous battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Just as Baraga was safe, so was Lorelei&mdash;the one who had supposedly been crushed by the Demon Colossus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra had been monitoring the battlefield in sync with the Demon Colossus. Therefore, he felt uncomfortable when he heard Gladium&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Get up quickly, he said? Just who was he talking to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While he was thinking about this, he noticed that Baraga was back on his feet. He hurriedly tried to alert Gabil, but before he could do so, he felt a chill run down his spine and turned around. Standing there, he realized, was a girl whose appearance had changed dramatically. No, calling her a girl might not be correct either&hellip; She had the form of a girl, but her skin was metallic and reddish-black. Her body was not of flesh and blood, but rather of rock that had been transformed into magisteel. It was like a polished mirror, and it was obvious at a glance that this was not a human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip;have you assimilated with Lorelei?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kishishishi, that&rsquo;s right. As expected of the wise Gadra-dono. You are well versed in otherworldly knowledge, but our approach is a bit different.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, I see. That&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure. I will show all its power to you, so let me know what you think!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A girl with an evil smile&mdash;&ldquo;Black Tortoise&rdquo; Gozarin laughed at Gadra as if to incite him. Then she took a step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Gadra, he would prefer to not toss around his old bones in a fight again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought that he had defeated Lorelei with brute force, but it seems that it was just an act. Realizing this, Gadra revised his estimation of Gozarin&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Good grief. Is this genetic engineering? The nature of monsters has many mysteries, and I thought it would have little meaning in this world of magic&hellip;but was it the other way around? I&rsquo;m impressed that they&rsquo;ve achieved so much in the quest to assimilate with monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was quite impressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were many different kinds of monsters, and some of them did not have genes in the first place. It was believed that it would be too difficult to produce results because there was not enough time to solve all the different cases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why, in the Empire, genetic engineering was only studied in the field of medicine. At least that was supposed to be the case, but it seems that within the Magic Beast Corps, research was being carried out in secret. It was easy to assume that the content of the research was inhumane and could not be disclosed to the public.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was not a moral person himself, so he could understand the feeling of wanting to prioritize one&rsquo;s own intellectual curiosity first. That&rsquo;s why he wasn&rsquo;t going to complain, but he still regretted not being able to participate in the research. Because of that, it was unclear how much his opponent had been strengthened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the looks of it, Gozarin&rsquo;s power surpassed that of Demon Lord Clayman&rsquo;s. She seemed to be less powerful than Sare who was a &lsquo;Saint&rsquo;, but she still appeared to have almost as many magicules as Sare. In terms of the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten, she surpassed even the pre-awakened Zegion. The amount of magicules was not equal to one&rsquo;s strength, but she was definitely a dangerous opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Dragon Lords would be no match for you. It seems that I&rsquo;ll have to take you on seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor to be recognized by a Master Gadra. Now, have a taste of this power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin took action. Her forward thrust was heavier than a 10-ton dump truck hitting him at over 300 km/h. Even the Demon Colossus, which was just over 3 meters tall and weighed more than 30-tons, was easily blown back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra adjusted his stance unhurriedly and shouted, &ldquo;Purple Thunder!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the name implied, a purple electric shock was unleashed. It was a one-million-volt discharge, one of the armaments installed in the Demon Colossus. Incidentally, just because the voltage was high did not necessarily mean that the power was high, and the weapon had been implemented just because it looked cool. It wasn&rsquo;t worth more than it looked like, but it was the best way to scare adventurers. And it also managed to get through to Gozarin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-what the hell?! It&rsquo;s not magic? You can manipulate lightning strikes without activating mana&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather than because of its power, she froze out of surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yes. It&rsquo;s a secret weapon after all. Rimuru-sama had faith in me and entrusted me with this. Therefore, defeat must not be allowed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was also enthusiastic. He had analyzed Gozarin&rsquo;s thrusts and found that her body structure had been replaced by magisteel components. His guess was that it was Lorelei&rsquo;s special ability. Although the material was heavier and harder than steel, Gozarin&rsquo;s movements were smooth. Moreover, her hidden power was comparable to that of a &lsquo;saint&rsquo;, and there was no choice but to admit that it was a despicable transformation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Gadra had the Demon Colossus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take this, the ultimate magical weapon&mdash;Demonic Buster!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again, it was the most powerful weapon in his arsenal. Because the fire control system was linked to Gadra&rsquo;s will, the weapon could be activated without any time lag. The &lsquo;Demonic Buster&rsquo; was the strongest of his weapons. It was a name that respected the demons, following the style of Gadra the magic geek. Its performance could be described as a magicule convergence gun. It converged and launched not only the magicules from the mana furnace within the Demon Colossus, but also the magicules in the surrounding atmosphere. One-shot kill was the best term used to describe this weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chest of the Demon Colossus opened up, revealing Gadra&rsquo;s figure through the transparent membrane. From the center of the palms of his hands, a ray of light was emitted. It was the focal point of the magicule-gathering destructive ray.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk!! As expected of the former commander of the Magic Corps,&rdquo; Gozarin said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seemed to have chosen defense instead of evasion, and her expression was very stiff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Flush it out! &lsquo;Magisteel Ultra-Fine Vibration Wave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minute fluctuations begin to ripple across the surface of Gozarin&rsquo;s body. It was a specific vibration emitted by the magisteel. This frequency of the magisteel was unique in that it could create waves that bounced back magicules. This was the reason why Gadra&rsquo;s magic did not work; by assimilating with Lorelei, Gozarin was able to freely manipulate this property.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The convergence of magicules and the diffusion of magicules. Those two opposing forces collided. The winner was Gozarin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kishi, kishishishi! I survived. The victory is mine!!&rdquo; Gozarin shouted with joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was a wizard. Naturally, this meant that he relied on magic for his attacks. Gozarin&rsquo;s body, on the other hand, was made of magisteel, which gave her an absolute advantage over magic. Both of them were aware of this. That&rsquo;s why Gadra had used the most powerful weapon in his arsenal. If this did not work, then it could be said that Gadra had virtually no way to defeat Gozarin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a headache. I didn&rsquo;t expect her to defend it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was considered a powerful person. He had defeated opponents with more magicules than himself. Even against a saint like Sare, he had overwhelmed him with the difference in skill-level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was one type of enemy that was inexplicably incompatible with him. It was an opponent against whom none of his attacks could work. If he could not defeat them, then he could not win, even if he did not lose. Gadra understood that he was at a disadvantage in this battle. He wondered what he should do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">This is a critical moment, I suppose. I am an outsider, and Rimuru-sama does not fully trust me. If I fail to show my resolve here, I will never be accepted as a true member of the group.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was highly impressed by Rimuru&rsquo;s generosity. Rimuru had accepted Gadra, who had abandoned the Empire, even though he had reeked of suspicion. Not only that, but he recognized his abilities and entrusted him with a major role. Not to mention, the environment of the monster country was wonderful. It had research facilities that rivaled, if not surpassed, those of the Empire. His best friend Adalmann was also there. Adalmann was now one of the Twelve Guardian Lords, and Gadra was very proud of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">As long as they are there, I am sure they will lead me to the deep abyss of my hobby of magical research. In order to live up to that lord&rsquo;s expectations, I have to be useful here.</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1">Gadra, wishfully thinking of the primordial demons he had hoped would be his masters of magic, recalled the memories and made up his mind. However, his memories were over-embellished. One of them rejected him as if he were a fool, another one almost tricked him into becoming a test subject, and the other one, for some reason, was more interested in swordplay than magic and had invited him to train&hellip;but these were all conveniently misinterpreted in Gadra&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, there was one demon with whom he had hit it off, praising him after he had complimented Rimuru&rsquo;s magic. So altogether, Gadra&rsquo;s memory wasn&rsquo;t completely wrong&hellip; That demon&mdash;Diablo&mdash;and Gadra had made a pact. If Gadra could find a way to gain Diablo&rsquo;s approval, he would be taken in as one of his dependents. Therefore, Gadra could not die in a place like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had ordered him not to do anything rash. But&mdash;a thought flashed through Gadra&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have not been defeated yet!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The battle has just begun, little girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kishishishi. Good, good. My power, allow me to carve it into your body!&rdquo; Gozarin responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the two collided once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin, who was less than half the size of the Demon Colossus, fought back with full force. The scene was quite bizarre. The Demon Colossus, with its superior weight, was being pushed back. Moreover, Gozarin was strange. The surface of her back made a small noise, and countless tentacles sprouted. The tips of these tentacles sharpened to a fine point and thrust into the Demon Colossus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huu?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kisha!! More, more! Blood. Show me more blood!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin appeared to be overcome in a fever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her tentacles were made of magisteel. Moreover, by generating high frequencies with minute vibrations, they could pierce any material like clay. This technique, which could also be used for cutting, was called a high-frequency thousand-hand thrust (K&#333;sh&#363;ha Senjutotsu), or a high-frequency thousand-hand slash (K&#333;sh&#363;ha Senjuzan).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of the Demon Colossus&rsquo; hands were easily blown away by the K&#333;sh&#363;ha Senjuzan. Even if the material was the same magic steel, Gozarin had the advantage because she was a living organism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuh, the precious body that Rimuru-sama entrusted to me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a piece of junk in front of me. You&rsquo;re an old geezer after all, too old to be relying on a toy like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so noisy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra shouted in frustration, but his words were full of regret. As proof, Gadra&rsquo;s body had also been pierced by the tentacles, leaving it filled with holes. His body was a bloody wreck, but he remained adamant, taking advantage of the fact that Gozarin could not see him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You sure are persistent. This situation is impossible to turn around. There&rsquo;s no need to be ashamed. Even a legendary wizard can&rsquo;t overcome the tide of the times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost yet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How unsightly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two tentacles extended from Gozarin, transforming into blades. Then they cut off both of the Demon Colossus&rsquo; legs. With that, the Demon Colossus&rsquo; limbs were gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Swear your obedience to me. And I&rsquo;ll spare your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra&rsquo;s knowledge was too valuable to be lost here. That&rsquo;s why Gozarin made the offer, but Gadra did not agree to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am a selfish person at heart. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t betray my belief and love of magic. I could never follow someone who mocked magic!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His otaku</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;soul exploded in full swing. When someone makes fun of something you love, it&rsquo;s possible to get angry from the bottom of your heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra&rsquo;s spirit and guts were now burning fiercely. And that anger gave him the determination to cast a forbidden spell. It was a self-destructive spell that converted his own life force into fuel that burned everything violently&mdash;&lsquo;Sacrifice&rsquo; (Elemental magic Life-sublimation).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Ahh&hellip; I was planning to be recognized by Diablo-sama and become his disciple&hellip; Oh, well. I have my own mystic art &lsquo;Reincarnation&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll be leaving this world for a while, but next time I will aim for the magical abyss!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rather than losing, he chose to win and escape. That was the kind of man Gadra was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You choose to resist me? Then you&rsquo;re useless. Die!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin&rsquo;s tentacles pierced Gadra&rsquo;s chest. A moment later, a dazzling flash of light erupted from the Demon Colossus. A light that burned through everything. It was the flame of elemental magic &lsquo;Sacrifice&rsquo;, which Gadra had unleashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-what the?! Aiming for this&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin&rsquo;s words disappeared and were swallowed up by the flames of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And on the ground, a small flower bloomed.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Gladium was strong. But even more troublesome was Baraga, who had awakened the power of a Chimera Knight. He was a different person from before. His power could not be underestimated, even by the current Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one compared only the amount of magicules, Gabil was superior. Even if you take into account the skill-level of their spearmanship, Gabil was probably better. However, in terms of overall strength, there was not much of a difference. If he threw caution to the wind, he could win, but there were two enemies. With Gladium in the way, Gabil was having a hard time attacking Baraga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, Gabil had something else to worry about. He was worried about Souka, who was fighting against Gladium&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the three generals, the &ldquo;Vermillion Bird&rdquo; Nazim, appeared to be as strong as a demon lord. She seemed to be of the same race as the demon lord Frey, and Gabil believed that they were similar in strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was why he judged that Souka would not be able to defeat her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Gabil evolved, Souka had also become more powerful. She was now strong enough to be considered very powerful amongst the greater majin, but she still could only be considered an adjutant-class for a demon lord. She was not strong enough to fight a demon lord herself, and victory was hopeless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souka was currently still alive because Nazim enjoyed cruelly tormenting her. Gabil was aware of this and was anxious to go to her aid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Gladium and Baraga were powerful opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sister. Just hold on&rsquo;&mdash;Gabil prayed for her to endure, but he was focused on his own enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then another shock struck Gabil. A flash of light broke out on the ground, and at the center of it was Master Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ga-Gadra-dono?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; from Gabil did not go through. What that meant was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To make matters worse, he saw a small figure standing up. Despite her wounds, Gozarin, one of the three generals, was still safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga shot a spear attack at Gabil, who was unable to hide his dismay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look, look, look. You can&rsquo;t afford to distract yourself now, can you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! Of course. You are no match for me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite his words, Gabil didn&rsquo;t have room for much more. The odds were stacked against him, and the word &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; was beginning to appear in his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, reinforcements that Gabil could never have imagined arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, looks like you&rsquo;re in trouble here. Want me to help you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unexpectedly, it was someone Gabil knew quite well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t listen to anyone. I had to ask Milim to transfer me because I was worried about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was another person. The beautiful queen and ruler of the skies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Karion-dono, Frey-dono, why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil asked in surprise, to which Karion replied with a smile.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk later, okay? Let&rsquo;s get rid of these guys first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey nodded lightly, as if agreeing with Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that we are allied, it&rsquo;s only natural that we would send reinforcements. We will also join the fight, so we&rsquo;ll be under Benimaru-dono&rsquo;s command.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion&rsquo;s Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance, though less than a hundred in number, were a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same was true of Frey&rsquo;s entourage, the Tensh&#333;sh&#363;. The warrior-type winged tribes (harpies) were rare, but their power was well-known.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite their small numbers, they were the most reliable reinforcements they could get.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll be counting on you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil stopped worrying and accepted the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had contacted Benimaru for instructions and had received an immediate reply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;We&rsquo;re working on your situation, but I&rsquo;m in the process of grasping it through Moss&rsquo;s eyes. Don&rsquo;t let your guard down. That Gladium bastard is up to something. Keep an eye out for those soldiers at the end!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s orders were straightforward. There were no detailed instructions as to who was to deal with whom, just the essentials.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This, on the contrary, made Gabil happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the feeling that people trusted and relied on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, Karion-dono, I would like to ask you to deal with the enemy&rsquo;s general.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hehe, so you are aware. That guy is a disgrace to the beastmen. I thought he was dead by now, I&rsquo;m surprised he&rsquo;s still alive. I&rsquo;m going to put a stop to him once and for all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion had intended to do so from the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why he gladly accepted Gabil&rsquo;s instructions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I guess I&rsquo;ll be dealing with that bird woman, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re talking about bird women, Frey might be one too&mdash;is what Gabil thought, but he was not so stupid as to be unaware of what would happen if he mentioned that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, he was worried about his sister, Souka, so Frey&rsquo;s offer was a blessing in disguise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm. May I ask that of you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He asked grandly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Then, I will go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey glanced over to both of her &lsquo;Twin Wings.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of the rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good luck, Frey-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey nodded and flew away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, she headed for &ldquo;Vermillion Bird&rdquo; Nazim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim, who was tormenting Souka, also noticed the sudden intrusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Frey!! I am the true queen of the harpies. Today is the day that I will take revenge for all my years of bitterness!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unbeknownst to Frey herself, Nazim was Frey&rsquo;s twin sister. Nazim was born a powerful mutant, but unfortunately, she was not fertile. Being of female descent, the harpy tribe could not accept a queen who was unable to bear children.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through no fault of her own, Nazim could not become queen. Nazim was banished by the Queen at the time, as she felt that it would cause problems in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she wandered around, she was picked up by Gladium, but Nazim&rsquo;s anger and hatred for her people continued to grow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now Frey, the symbol of that hatred, was right in front of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim felt a strange mixture of joy and hatred as she flew to intercept Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at them from a distance, Karion spoke aloofly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s get started here, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium, on the other hand, gritted his teeth with anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look down on me, damn brat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like Frey&rsquo;s dealing with a blood relative too. Hey, I guess it&rsquo;s fate. If we hadn&rsquo;t come as reinforcements, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten this opportunity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Opportunity?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m gonna kill you and prove that I&rsquo;m the strongest beastman in the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Load of crap, that&rsquo;s my line!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion and Gladium were two men with very similar personalities and intonations. Their tempers were fierce, and they would never stand side by side as equals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion was right, this was a battle of fate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on. I&rsquo;ll show you the difference in our strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion activated his Unique Skill &lsquo;Beastification&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and became the true form of the Beast Master. He was fully armed and gave his all from the start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium, on the other hand, had the power of the White Tiger, which he had not shown even in his battle with Gabil. The lone tiger, clad in the Empire&rsquo;s military uniform, intercepted the king of beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the battlefield, two fronts were formed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Powerful forces clashed with each other, creating a force field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil watched the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reinforcements were moving according to Benimaru&rsquo;s instructions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing to worry about. Like the Kurenai and the Hiryuu, they were under the command of Dolph, the leader of the Pegasus Knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru gave appropriate instructions at key points, but he decided that it would be better to leave detailed instructions to those who were in the area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil also supported this decision. He could imagine that Benimaru would be challenging the enemy leaders, just as he himself was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the decision seemed to have been correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Empire&rsquo;s &lsquo;Magic Beast Corps&rsquo; boasted members with high individual combat power, but their movement as a group wasn&rsquo;t great. Therefore, the Allied forces, which were outnumbered, were able to maintain the front line through skillful coordination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was no denying that they were outnumbered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reinforcements were much welcomed, and a counterattack was about to be launched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it looks like things are going well. Souka seems to have returned safely to recover, and I must do my best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you think can afford to look the other way when you&rsquo;re dealing with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil, who had his eyes fixed on the battlefield, was met with a sharp spear blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His opponent was Baraga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium had left with Karion, but the battle with Baraga was still ongoing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! There are orders from the Commander-in-Chief, we can&rsquo;t just focus on dealing with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really being underestimated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the ones who are taking us for fools, aren&rsquo;t you? If that man Gladium had been serious from the start, I might not have survived.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! The great beast king</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;would never take you seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Gabil shook his head in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just being careless. As the saying goes, &ldquo;A lion does his best to catch a rabbit.&rdquo; In this world of the weak and the strong, is it not simple etiquette to do your best, no matter who you are up against?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil responded with pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, Gabil couldn&rsquo;t help but think of his comrades as he said this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were many who didn&rsquo;t always give their all against their enemies&mdash;It suddenly occurred to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first of these was Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil sometimes challenged him to a mock battle, but he had been beaten down in a rather pathetic manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">That person is an exception, isn&rsquo;t he? I can&rsquo;t complain, though, because it would be over in an instant if he got serious&hellip; Although we are in the same position, there is a huge difference between Diablo-dono and myself. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but that is the reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had recognized him and given him the highest honor of being one of the &ldquo;Twelve Guardian Lords.&rdquo; He was proud of this, but more than that, Gabil had become more aware of his own standing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having awakened and become stronger, he realized the strength of Diablo and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the three demon girls, who were not allowed to evolve at the victory party, were much stronger than the current Gabil. If so, then Diablo, who was stronger than them and had evolved, was a monster beyond Gabil&rsquo;s imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if they fought, he could not win. He admitted that this was inevitable, but if he gave up, it really would be the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as he kept chasing after it without giving up, it did not matter if he could not win right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil thought as such, and so always remained ambitious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was precisely because of this that Gabil knew what true strength was. Although it was just his instinct, he understood that the strongest were not the likes of Gladium or Baraga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I will never be defeated!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You fool! Your defeat is already a foregone conclusion. Know that you owe me a debt of gratitude for dying before you can see the hell that lies ahead!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga&rsquo;s attacks grew sharper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil brushed them aside with a parry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm. Are you referring to the change in your soldiers? I&rsquo;d like to hear about what they&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Gabil pointed this out, Baraga&rsquo;s movements slowed down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then glared at Gabil as if he was a little upset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;you noticed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. We have a very good commander after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even so, it&rsquo;s already too late. The order has been given. The only thing you can do is die in despair!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To prove this, Baraga pointed to the evidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Gozarin who had fully recovered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, it is indeed an impressive recovery, but that&rsquo;s just the kind of skill a strong opponent should have, is it not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had noticed that Gozarin was fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it was not surprising, Gabil thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Baraga smiled fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s not Gozarin, it&rsquo;s the people around her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A chill ran down Gabil&rsquo;s spine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the fallen figure of an Imperial soldier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t understand Baraga&rsquo;s intentions, proudly pointing out the death of his comrades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, before that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Speaking of which, when did those men die?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hadn&rsquo;t paid attention to it because there were so many of them, but the number of deaths was extraordinary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A closer look revealed that many of them had left the front lines and were descending to the ground. Looking at where they were going, he saw that some of them were coughing up blood and collapsing on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you not notice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, they died on their own&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly. Gladium-sama made his decision. We have now entered the time of great experimentation!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that said, Baraga laughed loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of his insane laughter echoed across the battlefield, chilling the hearts of all who heard it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil, too, was horrified by what he saw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something terrible was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Zamud has informed me that His Majesty the Emperor is in danger. In addition, the enemy is said to have summoned a large number of evil demons. Their strength is unknown, but it is estimated to be more than you can handle. If things continue as they are, a great deal of damage is to be expected. Therefore, I&rsquo;ve decided to counter them with our last resort. Offer up your courage and loyalty. Activate the trump card I have given you, and you will gain the power to defeat the demons!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Immediately after issuing the order to the three generals, he also transmitted the order to the soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The drug to be administered was distributed in the form of pills as a trump card for reinforcements. However, there were restrictions on the use of these pills, and they could not be used without the order of Gladium, the Corps Commander.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the restriction had been lifted by a secret order from Gladium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Hmph! If they succeed, they will gain immense power. Besides, there&rsquo;s a chance only a few will be affected by the side effects. If they want to hate me, they can just hate themselves for being unable to adapt!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those were Gladium&rsquo;s true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was purely a self-centered man at his very core.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium calmly ordered the members of his army to &ldquo;die&rdquo;. His decision was ruthless, but it was also true that there was a high possibility that the demons would overrun his army if this continued. It was a rational decision to force them to seek power at the risk of death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The members of the group quickly carried out the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since they were not informed of the contents of the order, there was no hesitation in their actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, the forbidden Medical Skill &lsquo;The Beast&rsquo; was activated by the will of the soldiers who knew nothing themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The effect slowly ate away at the bodies of the Magic Beast Corps soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because they were in the middle of battle, the changes were overlooked at first. However, as time passed, the results became more clear.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ground was covered with the strewn corpses of the dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These were the bodies that Gabil saw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were also many who rushed into the enemy lines in a rampage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Kurenai, Hiryuu, &lsquo;Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;Tensh&#333;sh&#363;&rsquo; were forced to struggle against them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the midst of the battlefield, there were also those who were confused by their own changes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These would be the true warriors that Gladium sought.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">10,000 dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5,500 who turned into magic beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5,000 who turned into magic beasts and went berserk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5,000 who went berserk in a hybrid human/magic beast form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4,000 who housed &lsquo;The Beast&rsquo; and possessed the power of a beast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">400 who awakened as Chimera Knights.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The probabilities of success or failure were fixed and had more or less come close to the predictions. Since the population of the experiment was small, it would not have been surprising if the results had been more disastrous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result, the Magic Beast Corps, which had 30,000 members, was greatly reduced in number. However, the power of the corps was greatly increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who went berserk would immediately be defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were useful as a decoy, but once it was done, there was no going back. Therefore, Gladium was prepared to abandon them without a single regret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of those who survived, only 10,000, half of them, were able to fight with reason. However, this was a little more than Gladium had expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">More than half of them would be unable to return to human form, but for now, they were a valuable asset. Gladium was satisfied with the results.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moreover, 400 Chimera Knights had been born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter who their opponents were, they would not be defeated. Gladium nodded his head in satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was still too early to relax.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took some time to achieve this result, but they had yet to reorganize their forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium would have liked to take the lead, but unfortunately, Karion was in the way. In that case, he had his three generals to rely on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Azure Dragon&rdquo; Baraga was fighting Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vermillion Bird&rdquo; Nazim was engaged in a fierce battle with Frey.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only one left was &ldquo;Black Tortoise&rdquo; Gozarin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Gozarin, quickly regroup your troops!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Kishishishi, understood. It seems that we&rsquo;ve achieved more than expected. I&rsquo;m very pleased.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Hm. I&rsquo;ll leave you to it!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He gave the order with a simple &lsquo;telepathy&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The current necessity was to reorganize the forces while the 10,000 berserkers were on the loose. Gladium was relieved that Gozarin was okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the self-centered Gladium trusted those he approved of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heh, can you really afford to look the other way when you&rsquo;re dealing with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m the legion commander. I&rsquo;m not some wild beast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You call yourself a legion commander at the expense of your own men? You make me laugh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fool, that&rsquo;s what war is all about. If you can&rsquo;t make that kind of judgment, you&rsquo;re just no good. It seems that you were kicked out of the demon lord&rsquo;s position by a newcomer, but I pity those who serve someone so powerless!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion slashed at him in anger, but there was a hint of impatience in his attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unbelievably, Gladium had grown much stronger than he had imagined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey now, that attack was weak. It was so slow as if you were standing still.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium walked up behind Karion, speaking lightly. His right hand was equipped with a huge claw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tiger claw glittered with a silvery white brilliance&mdash;the White Tiger (Byakko) Claw. This claw, which also bore the names of two of the Beastketeers</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c1">, was a special weapon that had transformed into the mythical-grade, loaned to Gladium from the Emperor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A mythical-grade weapon could slice through any opponent. It was a weapon capable of slaughtering spiritual life forms, and it was a perfect match for Gladium, who possessed god-like speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Using his well-trained footwork, Gladium toyed with Karion. Even the Legendary-grade armor that protected Karion was like scrap metal in the face of the White Tiger Claw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, what&rsquo;s wrong? You said you were going to kill me, but was that all just talk?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up. I thought it would be easier to kill you, but it seems my calculations were wrong&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion&rsquo;s training with Milim had made him stronger. That is why he was still able to fight without being fatally wounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was even more surprised about that. The battle power gap was directly related to the difference in weapons performance. Gladium had thought the battle would&rsquo;ve ended sooner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this respect, the two of them were similar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their strengths were also similar, with Karion having the advantage in strength and Gladium having the advantage in weaponry. Overall, Gladium had the advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Understanding this clearly, Gladium moved to finish Karion off without a second thought. But in that moment, something happened that Gladium could have never imagined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? The power&hellip;power is welling up?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a sign of evolution. It was the beginning of the Harvest Festival for a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&mdash;awakening under these circumstances was nothing but an obstacle for Gladium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-What is this drowsiness&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium wobbled unsteadily. Karion did not miss this opportunity and escaped his crisis, regaining his position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, are you tired already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion observed Gladium while trying to stir him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was this something bad or something auspicious&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As anyone could tell, Gladium&rsquo;s power was beginning to increase. This was because magicules were gathering together and a huge amount of youki was flowing out of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, Gladium himself was wobbling around, barely able to stand up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">What&rsquo;s going on? Is this guy really awakening?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A story Karion had heard recently came to his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a victory party held by Rimuru, an evolutionary ritual was performed. It was reported that some of the executives left the party after being lulled into an irresistible slumber.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wasn&rsquo;t it said that to become a True Demon Lord, you need to sleep? If that&rsquo;s the case, then isn&rsquo;t this the exact moment?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion was not a fool, but he was not the most perceptive either. This time, however, he was able to show brilliant insight, as if his life was at stake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">According to Frey&rsquo;s guess, &lsquo;souls&rsquo; are necessary for evolution&hellip; Oh yeah, Gladium&rsquo;s subordinates are dying all over the place&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, all of the conditions were met.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was needed to evolve into a True Demon Lord was a hateful &lsquo;soul&rsquo;. Of course, this was not the case for all of them, but enduring the hatred of those you have killed was one of the trials necessary for awakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was left defenseless in a situation as critical as &ldquo;in the middle of a battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was karmic retribution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The subordinates who trusted Gladium must have felt betrayed. Their souls were filled with hatred and turned on Gladium, the object of their resentment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion did not see it that accurately, but he judged this to be both the greatest danger and the greatest opportunity at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that heaven is on my side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-Wait! Wait just a moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you always been living your life as you please? It&rsquo;s time for you to pay for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down and think it over. You can only call yourself the strongest if you defeat me in perfect condition. I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t want to settle this half-heartedly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium was getting really impatient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He felt like he was about to be killed, but he was feeling so sleepy. The situation was so unexpected that he could not think of any countermeasures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked around for his trusty subordinates, but Baraga and Nazim were in a fierce battle. Gozarin was in the process of reorganizing the Chimera Knights, but with the onslaught from Rimuru&rsquo;s forces, she didn&rsquo;t seem to have the time to come and help Gladium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least for this moment, no one could come to Gladium&rsquo;s aid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gladium dropped to his knees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">It can&rsquo;t be, damn it!! Just when I was finally one step away from obtaining the greatest power&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could feel the power flooding into him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if in proportion to that, there was a rush of sleepiness coming over him that made it impossible to resist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If only the awakening could be achieved, he could defeat even Velgrynd. Gladium thought as such, but the reality was cruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no reason why Gladium would be able to endure the ordeal that even Rimuru was unable to resist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His face was a mess of tears and regret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Screw you! Screw you, damn it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a final shout, Gladium fell asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For those who are unable to overcome their trials&mdash;death was the only ending.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good, because you can die in your sleep. Now then, goodbye! &lsquo;Beast Roar&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion was not the kind of compassionate man who would show mercy here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he was a demon lord, he believed himself to be the strongest, but now Karion was a general who led an army. Because he had come as backup, it was natural for him to put victory before his own pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man whose burning ambitions could have gotten him to a higher level was overthrown by Karion.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The only thing that remained was his head with a regretful expression on his face, and it was obvious that it would be impossible to revive him from this state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, how&hellip;how could this be? Just when we were so close to achieving our long-cherished goal&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chasing the lamenting Baraga, Gabil also rushed over. Then, without hesitation, he aimed the Vortex Spear, the treasure of the lizardmen, at Baraga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his gaze fixed on Baraga, Gabil opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Karion-dono, that was an impressive victory! I was impressed by your dignity!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a compliment to Karion for defeating the enemy, but it was Gabil&rsquo;s true feelings. Gladium&rsquo;s power, which could even handle mythical-grade weapons, was greater than Gabil&rsquo;s, even though he was a Demon Lord Seed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only natural for him to admire Karion for defeating him, even if it was a combination of chance and luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Karion, the one who was praised, began to turn pale for some reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, I thought there was no way, but this might be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t appear able to reply to Gabil and seemed to be wondering about something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm? Is something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil asked if he was feeling unwell, and Karion looked at him like he was in a daze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then he told him a shocking truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, I came all this way to help you, but it looks like I&rsquo;m done here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now way, are you hurt?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. It&rsquo;s the awakening, I guess. Apparently, the souls that Gladium was supposed to receive have gone to me. It&rsquo;s a grudge. For being so defenseless at this point, I can&rsquo;t even laugh at Gladium anymore&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion couldn&rsquo;t help but mock himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sensing the situation, Gabil was unable to hide his turmoil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, but I&rsquo;m going to fall asleep here. If you can afford it, protect me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course! Please rest assured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil smiled as if to reassure Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karion returned the smile and then fell over on his back. Then with a final word about hoping to awaken safely, he drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He may seem fearless, but even he could not resist the evolutionary sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga was not amused. If the situation had been even a little different, then he would have been in Gabil&rsquo;s position. And instead of Karion, Gladium would have been the one in an evolutionary sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uooooooo!! I&rsquo;ll never forgive you. I won&rsquo;t allow you to take advantage of this when you&rsquo;ve done absolutely nothing to deserve it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a rage, he turned his hateful eyes towards Gabil and Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Baraga&rsquo;s hand, the shining relic of Gladium was being held.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The White Tiger Claw&mdash;It was the ultimate mythical-grade weapon, a weapon that embodied the will of its owner, whom it recognized as its master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lend me your strength, O White Tiger Claw. Let me avenge Gladium-sama&rsquo;s death!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if in response to Baraga&rsquo;s voice, the glow of the White Tiger Claw increased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The light converged and a spear took shape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah&hellip; You&rsquo;ve acknowledged me as your master!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga rejoiced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In his hand, he held the Azure Dragon Spear, which was transformed from the White Tiger&rsquo;s claw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gabil, was it? I&rsquo;ll kill you and get rid of the thief who sleeps over there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense! I, too, have made a pact between men. The evolutionary sleep of Karion-dono, you should know that it shall not be disturbed by any means!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil yelled back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the battle between the two men resumed.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

You can&rsquo;t even defeat me, so how dare you mock Gladium-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. I was just stating a fact, not trying to mock him. Besides, I&rsquo;m not the one who&rsquo;s helpless, I just haven&rsquo;t struck yet. I hope you haven&rsquo;t mistaken my actions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though Frey rarely made a move of her own, her strength as an ex-demon lord was not to be underestimated. Although the &ldquo;Vermillion Bird&rdquo; Nazim, was more powerful in terms of magicule quantity, Frey had only been using speed and technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All you do is scurry away and talk a big game.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait until after the fight to decide if I was talking big or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wouldn&rsquo;t be defeated in this argument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are people in this world who were very good at making their opponents feel uncomfortable. Frey was one of those types of people, and even Demon Lord Milim couldn&rsquo;t win one over Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Frey was not just flying around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was observing her opponent and searching for her weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way she could win by force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey was faster, but her opponent was stronger in power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this rate, Frey would be outmatched, but the opportunity to win could be found in unexpected places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling impatient.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? How dare you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks to these eyes, I&rsquo;m finally able to see souls. It is a very useful ability.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey had become aware that the performance of her Extra Skill &lsquo;Celestial Eye&rsquo; had been improved. She smiled, thinking that this would give her an advantage in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s more, she was sure that the information she had just obtained would be the key to victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you say you can see?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim spat viciously, her claws finally catching hold of Frey&rsquo;s arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim smirked and laughed. The claws of the harpy had the effect of &lsquo;Magic Interference&rsquo; and could block the Skills of the captured opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahahahaha! What a fool you are. Did you get so absorbed in the middle of a conversation that you got caught?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim&rsquo;s tone brightened, as she had become sure of her victory. This attitude proved even more that Nazim was impatient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey remained calm in the face of danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She continued to observe Nazim, nonchalantly confirming her impatience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take this! &lsquo;Shockwave&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From here, Nazim&rsquo;s onslaught began, as if it were a one-sided affair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey&rsquo;s clothes were torn apart by the impact. However, Frey&rsquo;s face was not distorted by anguish, and she continued to observe Nazim in a cool manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim noticed that Frey was acting strangely, but decided that she was just bluffing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As much as it pained her to admit it, Frey, her twin, was very intelligent. Nazim was the better fighter in simple combat power, but her opponent was a troublesome one to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Are you trying to trick me? No, trying to get away from these claws&mdash;this woman must be planning to turn the tables on me at the right moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim tormented Frey even more, as if the right thing to do was to continue the attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite this, Frey remained unfazed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just a little more, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey spoke quietly, but the words rang loudly in Nazim&rsquo;s ears. She couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;What do you mean by that?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about to be awakened, aren&rsquo;t you? Compared to the beginning of the battle, the amount of magicules you have has increased dramatically. It seems that when you awaken, you will fall asleep just like Gladium. I just have to wait for that moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey said with a devilish smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim paled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had wondered if it was possible, having been aware of the symptoms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the cause of Nazim&rsquo;s impatience. The moment Frey noticed this, Nazim was basically dancing in the palm of her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then so what?! All I have to do is kill you right now and retreat to safety!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim&rsquo;s dismay was compounded by the truth of Frey&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had to get rid of Frey before the evolutionary slumber set in. She had come to that decision, and increased the power of her attack by using all of her strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim had no way to realize that this was exactly what Frey was aiming for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Shockwave&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was already unknown how many times she had done this, but there was an intense electric shock that burned Frey. However, Frey did not receive a single burn or even a scratch from the impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Isn&rsquo;t it strange?! Why is this person acting so calm?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time she realized it, it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You seem curious. But your reaction confirms it. My mother, the previous queen, wanted you to be happy in a world where the herd didn&rsquo;t matter, away from racial strife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you had known the queen&rsquo;s secret, then you would have had to be killed. That&rsquo;s why she banished you without telling you anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t screw with me! There&rsquo;s no way a newborn fledgling could survive being abandoned! That was a clear attempt to kill me off!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim shouted in a rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Frey calmly contradicted her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you survived. That fact is proof that there was someone hiding and taking care of you. Mother was also naive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was something Nazim had always wondered about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had always wondered how she had been able to survive as a child until her ego was properly sprouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had been convinced that she had survived instinctively because she was a mutant. However, after hearing Frey&rsquo;s words, she began to wonder if it was possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Nazim, who had accumulated so much hatred, could not change her way of thinking now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bluffing! Yeah, I get it. You&rsquo;re trying to trick me and aiming for a counter attack. It would have been cute if you had just begged for your life, but your pride as an ex-demon lord wouldn&rsquo;t let you do that, would it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tried to believe that Frey, who had no choice, was just playing a trick on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That made sense. Forcing herself to think that way, Nazim increased the power of her blasts, determined not to be deceived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Die!! Maximum Shockwave!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The full force of the purple lightning struck Frey. It was the moment Frey had been waiting for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pathetic. Even thought you were let off the hook, you&rsquo;ve come back on your own to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There can only ever be one queen. I had to kill my mother to take her place. Of course, if you hadn&rsquo;t been abandoned, you would have had to kill me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I would have killed you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim, a rare combat type, had absolute confidence in her fighting abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she lost to Frey in terms of flying speed, she was superior in all other areas. There was no way she could lose in a fight, and she was on the verge of victory right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim wanted to scoff at Frey&rsquo;s words as they were not even sincere. But Frey&rsquo;s next words made her change her expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Being a harpy queen requires a lot of abilities. Only those who are born with them will be recognized as the next queen. You were unlucky enough to be born as my twin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really been talking smugly to me this whole time&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll get right to the point. The queen has an absolute advantage over any attacks from her own kind. In other words, any attacks from a harpy will not work on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me! There&rsquo;s no way such a ridiculous thing can be true!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a corner of her mind, Nazim thought about what it meant if it were true, but she brushed it off as improbable. If the story really was true, it would contradict the murder of the previous queen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You wanted to confuse me with a random story, but you should have come up with something more believable!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that you can&rsquo;t believe me, but it&rsquo;s true. Incidentally, the battle between the old and new queens doesn&rsquo;t always take place. Normally, two sisters with the same ability will fight each other, and the one who can dominate the other&rsquo;s power will be crowned queen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth is that one would also get the Demon Lord Seed at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because you were born as a mutant, it was up to me to kill my mother. What&rsquo;s even more unforgivable is that you trampled on my mother&rsquo;s wish to keep you alive. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re my sister or not, but I wish you could have lived somewhere quietly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! Do you think you&rsquo;ve already won? I&rsquo;m your sister, and I also have fighting abilities other than the harpy race. If you I use that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late. I already have enough energy saved. I don&rsquo;t want you to suffer, so I&rsquo;ll end it with one blow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-It can&rsquo;t be?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only then that Nazim noticed that Frey&rsquo;s wings had turned purple. The beautiful pure white wings with golden mesh had become discolored with purple electricity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim froze in fear as she realized what this meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">She was storing the shockwave I released?! If so, how powerful is&mdash;?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tried to escape in a panic, but the claws holding Frey&rsquo;s arms were stuck. Frey&rsquo;s slender hands were also attached to Nazim&rsquo;s wrists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Nazim had been awakened before she met Frey, the outcome might have been different. But unfortunately, that was only a hypothetical story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Goodbye, elder sister. &lsquo;Echo Reflection&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey did not hesitate. All feelings had been left behind when she had become queen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the accumulated purple electricity was released at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the ability that Frey had acquired&mdash;the Unique Skill &lsquo;Double Winner&rsquo;. Frey was able to strike back at her opponent with any attack she received.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a difficult Skill to use because the user was also damaged, but in this case, since it was an attack from one of her own kind, this was Frey&rsquo;s complete dominance, despite the fact that the enemy was stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nazim, who had been hit by all the accumulated electric shocks, was charred to death in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re my sister or not, but I feel troubled by my mother&rsquo;s sweetness&hellip;Still, I&rsquo;m a little jealous, elder sister. At least, you certainly received my mother&rsquo;s love&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frey bid those words of farewell to Nazim as she fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words never reached Nazim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The harpy sisters failed to understand each other, and the time of their reunion had come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;It would have been nice if it had ended there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?! The souls that gathered in Nazim are coming towards me!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sudden drowsiness overtook Frey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way, then is this the evolutionary sleep? So instead of Nazim, the grudge is being taken out on me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t that Frey did not wish to awaken as a True Demon Lord, but there was still the matter of the time and place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had planned to laugh at Karion&rsquo;s stupidity later, but now Frey was filled with the feeling that this was not a joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was no point in complaining now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rucia</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c1">, Claire! You have to protect me. Protect Karion as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood, Frey-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As the Queen commands!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The twins responded immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she saw this, Frey flew next to Karion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She decided that it would be easier to protect them if they were grouped together rather than if they were separated. Besides, since Suphia of the Beastketeers was defending Karion&rsquo;s side, she thought that fighting alongside the Twin Wings would increase the chances of survival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Oh dear. Even though I was the one who came as reinforcement, I only ended up slowing everyone down. I didn&rsquo;t think that I would end up in such a mess, falling asleep in the middle of a battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inwardly, she was writhing in shame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was something that Frey had never expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without knowing if she would wake up again, Frey reluctantly fell asleep.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

However, in reality, even Gabil&rsquo;s own &lsquo;Dragon Skin&rsquo; was unable to prevent getting stabbed by the Azure Dragon Spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To have wounded me, you should not be underestimated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kakaka! That&rsquo;s my line. I had planned to kill you with a single blow, but you&rsquo;re tougher than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of them were covered in wounds. However, neither of them stopped their attacks. The wounds kept increasing, but neither of them seemed to care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising that you&rsquo;re evenly matched with me who has awakened. But I can&rsquo;t lose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! Gladium-sama would have been stronger than you even if he hadn&rsquo;t been awakened. If he had, he wouldn&rsquo;t have even struggled against you lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense! There are many under Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s command who are stronger than I am! You&rsquo;re pretty good, but you&rsquo;re nothing but small fry compared to someone like Miss Ultima.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words were equivalent to calling himself a small fish, but Gabil didn&rsquo;t seem to notice. Although lacking in that aspect, he himself took this statement very seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Gabil was struggling, he did not neglect to check the current war situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order not to involve the sleeping Karion, he dared to show an opening to induce Baraga&rsquo;s actions. Thanks to his efforts, he succeeded in shifting the location of the battle little by little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Suphia-dono has also rushed to his aid, so Karion-dono should be fine. Besides, I&rsquo;m sure I can pull off a few big moves without getting them involved here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In his own way, Gabil was thinking about many things as he fought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he was doing so, Frey also defeated one of the three generals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way?! Even Nazim has been defeated!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to the Glasium, the female commander who had been the second-in-command had also been killed. When confronted with this fact, Baraga was furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I absolutely won&rsquo;t forgive you! I will use my spear to avenge the death of my comrades!!&rdquo; He shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From here, Baraga came into his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A true Chimera Knight is a warrior who has mastered the Beastmen&rsquo;s Intrinsic Skill &lsquo;Beastification (beast transformation)&rsquo;. Do you understand? If you can endure the artificially given Medical Skill &lsquo;The Beast&rsquo;, you gain the ability to combine the power of man and beast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he began to explain, Baraga&rsquo;s body began to change more and more. Until now, he had maintained the form of a human, but now the features of a dragon were beginning to appear more and more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His military uniform swelled, but it did not tear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga had transformed into a form that resembled a dragon-like dragonewt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This feels amazing!. The release of my true power is such a freeing feeling!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Baraga&rsquo;s first time trying to reach this level. Whether or not the transformation would be successful&mdash;He had only imagined doing it himself and hadn&rsquo;t told anyone about the transformation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, with the death of Gladium, the shackles of Baraga&rsquo;s mind had been lifted. And now that his colleague Nazim had been defeated, there was no reason for him to hesitate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come here, you guys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga called out to his subordinates, who were running rampant. Even the poor soldiers, who had become magic beasts without a will, would obey the orders of the overwhelmingly powerful. Their instincts recognized him as their superior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only were there those who had turned into magic beasts, but there were also those who had taken the form of humans mixed with beasts. Baraga took a bite out of one of them at random.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magicules flowed into Baraga like a throbbing pulse. The one who was eaten dried up like a mummy, and his life was lost on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dare you! Those were your subordinates. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They should be grateful that they were lucky enough to die in my service.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How selfish! Do not think that I will let you get away with such cruelty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil made a piercing attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He instinctively understood that there would be trouble if he left things unattended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judging from the situation, he was probably replenishing energy from his subordinates in order to meet the new maximum value that had increased by his transformation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga&rsquo;s magicule level was still on par with Gabil&rsquo;s. He was on the verge of becoming an artificially awakened demon lord, it would be unfair to blame Gabil for his impatience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, impatience leads to the worst possible outcomes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fool! On the battlefield, those who lose their common sense are bound to die. Did you really think I would be so absorbed in my meal that I would let my guard down?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga&rsquo;s actions had a double meaning. The first was to compensate for the increase in his strength. The other was to put Gabil on a timer. The plan worked, and Gabil had jumped to his death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time he realized what was happening, it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his foot, Baraga skillfully manipulated the Azure Dragon Spear. The tip of the spear pierced Gabil&rsquo;s belly as he jumped into the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The magisteel breastplate did not cover his abdomen, and even Gabil&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dragon Skin&rsquo; could not withstand a sneak strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gw-gwah!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil coughed up blood as he was pierced in the stomach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing this, Baraga laughed loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kakakaka! You&rsquo;ll become my food too. Be honored!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was in a desperate crisis&mdash;but it seemed fate would not allow his death.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Confirmed. The effect of Unique Skill &lsquo;Lucky Devil&rsquo; has been activated&hellip; Successful. Individual Name: Gabil&rsquo;s fate has been changed, and &ldquo;death&rdquo; has been avoided.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the &ldquo;Voice of the World.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, Gabil&rsquo;s fate was altered by the power of his Unique Skill &lsquo;Lucky Devil&rsquo;, which he himself had forgotten about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a Unique Skill that he had acquired when Rimuru became a demon lord, but its effect was unknown. The only thing he knew was that it sometimes increased or decreased the power of his attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The effect made his attacks become stronger when he was in a good mood and become weaker when he was in a weak</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;mood. In a sense, it was the perfect ability for Gabil, but it was not a Skill that was easy to use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Gabil&rsquo;s life had been saved by this Unique Skill, apparently its full abilities were still unknown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwah?! What? I thought I had just been pierced in the stomach&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">However, Gabil was a man who did not care about the details, so he stopped thinking about what just happened and retook his stance against Baraga.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How can that be?! What the hell just happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Baraga&rsquo;s point of view, this was not so easy to ignore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had just managed to trick a foe as powerful as Gabil into thinking that he could finally defeat him, yet Gabil had stood up after his counterattack. It was only natural that he thought it was a trick. He had been sure of his victory so long as he could land that blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, you bastard! Let&rsquo;s go again, this time I&rsquo;ll make sure to pierce your heart!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He absorbed magicules and increased his strength. It would be a piece of cake to defeat Gabil without the need for any tricks, Baraga thought to himself, holding his Azure Dragon Spear back in his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two men were once again in a staring contest, ready to strike at the opportune moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was at a disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was fortunate to have his life saved once, but it would not happen again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unbeknownst to Gabil, the Unique Skill &lsquo;Lucky Devil&rsquo;s&rsquo; ability &lsquo;Change Fate&rsquo;, once activated, had a long period of time before it could be used again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how good the Skill was, the limit on that abilty was once a day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, Gabil was out of options. The continuous fighting had exhausted his strength. He had just risen from the brink of death and was in need of rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite this situation, Gabil smiled bravely, showing no signs of weakness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! Your skills are brilliant, but I will not lose to you. After all, my master is excellent, so you should not expect to win so easily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil sharpened his concentration so that he would be ready for any move Baraga might make.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;At that moment, the fate of the battle was decided&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not because of Gabil&rsquo;s Unique Skill, but because of the birth of &ldquo;Ciel&rdquo; in Rimuru&rsquo;s heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Gabil was about to struggle with all his might, a voice from the heavens came to his aid.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;Do you want power? Then I will give it to you. Please agree to the modification of your Unique Skills.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&mdash;?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil did not ask back what that meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice was so nostalgic, and so warm, that just listening to it made him feel calm. And so, without hesitation, Gabil agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The effect was dramatic.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;You made the right choice. The Unique Skill &lsquo;Lucky Devil&rsquo; will be sacrificed to give you new powers.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as the voice disappeared, a new power awakened in Gabil.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Psychology King Mood Maker&rsquo;&mdash;The skill granted by Ciel included five effects: &lsquo;Thought Acceleration,&rsquo; &lsquo;Change Destiny,&rsquo; &lsquo;Unexpected Effects,&rsquo; &lsquo;Spatial Manipulation,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; increased his speed of perception by a million times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Change Destiny&rsquo; was a superior version of the Unique Skill &lsquo;Lucky Devil&rsquo;s&rsquo; &lsquo;Change Fate,&rsquo; and could be activated at Gabil&rsquo;s will. However, the frequency of use was still limited to once a day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Unexpected Effects&rsquo; was also a superior version of the &lsquo;Lucky Devil&rsquo;s&rsquo; ability &lsquo;Unforeseen Effects&rsquo;. It allowed one to activate the increase in attack power at their will. However, the amount it increased still depended on the user&rsquo;s mood. This ability allowed one to increase his attack power when he was in an uplifted mood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Spatial Manipulation&rsquo; was an ability that could be used by the executives led by Benimaru. Its main purpose was &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo;, and it was a useful ability that allowed one to move freely in a place he had been to before, as long as the space was not being interfered with. By interfering with the space, one could be expected to be able to block the escape of enemies. It was a useful power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier&rsquo; was a defensive technique that Rimuru specialized in. By layering &lsquo;Barriers&rsquo; of various effects, it was possible to prepare for any attack. By accepting Rimuru&rsquo;s power, Gabil was able to use this as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The effects of previously thought to be useless Skills were now properly recognized by Gabil. Ciel taught it to him in his period of thought acceleration, which had been stretched a million times over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was deeply moved. He couldn&rsquo;t help but speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing, so amazing! I feel like I can&rsquo;t lose!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was getting carried away, but in Gabil&rsquo;s case, this was the right thing to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil laughed, blowing away the gloomy atmosphere. As if in proportion, Gabil&rsquo;s power increased greatly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-What the hell is the matter with you?! Your power has suddenly increased. What the hell did you do&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! It is unfortunate for you&hellip;but I have a great leader. As long as I have his protection, there is no way I can be defeated!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an uplifted mood, Gabil, who might&rsquo;ve been defeated depending on the situation, uttered his proud words. At the same time, Gabil&rsquo;s body began overflowing with power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was difficult to stop his momentum one he had started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, prepare yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quit speaking nonsense! My power, I will carve it into your body!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both men, who were comparable to awakened demon lords, clashed with their full power, and a moment later, it was Gabil who won the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s Vortex Spear precisely flicked away the Azure Dragon Spear that had been unleashed with all Baraga&rsquo;s might. This left a huge opening, and before Baraga could regain his stance, Gabil&rsquo;s stabbed a huge hole in his chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gah! N-not yet. With my healing ability, a wound of this magnitude&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, Baraga had also inherited the Beastmen&rsquo;s high healing power, and by replenishing the energy from his subordinates, he could heal some wounds instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Baraga tried to get through using it this time as well. But that was not to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To Gabil&rsquo;s own wonder, the combination of &lsquo;Change Destiny&rsquo; and &lsquo;Unexpected Effects&rsquo; was automatically activated, taking away Baraga&rsquo;s ability to heal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Change Destiny&rsquo; could only be used once a day, but that was only against the same target. So it turned out that it could also be used on enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Baraga himself had said, &lsquo;on the battlefield, those who lose their common sense are the first to die&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s more powerful than I expected&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, Gabil, with his newly gained powers, was victorious.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Before they could manage to put things together, a huge army of demons arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was called a huge army, but the number of individuals was not actually that large.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were only about 500 of them. However, their quality was worthy of being called a match for the thousands</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were high-ranking demon knights, the Devil Chevaliers&mdash;A terrifying battle group under the direct command of Demon Lord Rimuru. The Chimera Knights had almost twice the amount of magicules, but surprisingly, they were unable to gain an advantage in battle. That was how powerful the demons were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin&rsquo;s frustration grew as things did not go her way. In the midst of this situation, the fateful moment arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">That&rsquo;s, what the&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of the corner of Gozarin&rsquo;s eye, she saw a moving shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For some reason, a strange feeling appealed to her instincts. Trying to figure out what it was, Gozarin took her eyes off the battlefield and focused on the shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the right thing to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she had left the shadow alone, Gozarin would have died without understanding what had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;Gozarin might have been happier if she had just died without knowing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shadow stirred where the wreckage of Demon Colossus lay. In front of Gozarin, who was watching to see what was going on, the shadow stood up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a handsome man with a naked upper body and long black hair that reached his waist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His complexion was dark brown with a slight sheen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as if he were made of metal&mdash;No, from the waist down, he was melded with the remains of the Demon Colossus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right before Gozarin&rsquo;s eyes, the wreckage melted and changed its shape. And the man&rsquo;s lower body was also completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m naked. How embarrassing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tone of voice was very similar to that of the man Gozarin had just been fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-You, I can&rsquo;t believe it, but&hellip;are you a Master Gadra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin asked, and the man smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s me! Or did you think you had already won? That&rsquo;s right, I would never accept that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, the mysterious naked man was Master Gadra himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about?! You died from a self-destructing spell! That spell was supposed to burn up your life, so how are you still alive?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her comprehension still hadn&rsquo;t caught up with the situation, but hearing Gadra&rsquo;s words made her even more confused. She tried to change the flow of the conversation, thinking that it would be a bad idea to be carried by Gadra&rsquo;s pace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now. I blew myself up with &lsquo;Sacrifice&rsquo;, didn&rsquo;t I? Did you think that I was dead? Though, it&rsquo;s impossible for a man like me to kill himself. Until the battle is over, you should not relax and believe that you have won.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he spoke at length, Gadra created a garment with magic and hurriedly put it on. It was a shabby outfit, but he decided that it was better than being naked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Enough of this nonsense, answer my question!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Gozarin, she wanted to get rid of Gadra without a second thought. However, she was cautious because a person who was supposed to be completely dead had come back to life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t even sure if Gadra would answer honestly. That&rsquo;s why Gozarin was going to put all of her energy into her next attack, regardless of Gadra&rsquo;s response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">It&rsquo;s the old man after all, so I&rsquo;m sure he had some strange trick up his sleeve. Perhaps he prepared a substitute sacrifice. He&rsquo;s trying to upset me, but he&rsquo;s playing an elaborate trick. However, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be able to crush this little trick with my own strength!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin&rsquo;s magisteel body, despite its appearance, was extremely heavy. Therefore, even if one hit her at a certain speed, she could still show its power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to that, if Gozarin performed a K&#333;sh&#363;ha Senjuzan (high-frequency thousand-hand slash) with the tentacles all over her body, she would turn into a living bullet that could pulverize everything she touched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin put all of her strength into her legs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She used herself as a cannonball and gained propulsion by exploding the earth. This was Gozarin&rsquo;s other killer move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin took aim at Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unaware of this, Gadra politely began to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I have been reincarnated. The mystic art I developed: &lsquo;Reincarnation&rsquo;, was planted in advance. As long as I use this, I&rsquo;ll be able to live a new life with my memories intact, even if I have to say goodbye to this world for a little while. It&rsquo;s a wonderful secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;So then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The success rate is a little low, but the relative returns are great. I&rsquo;ve also been reincarnated so many times that success is almost always guaranteed&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, the first time one tried this, the success rate was at it&rsquo;s lowest. Adalmann&rsquo;s failure at that time had not been due to Gadra&rsquo;s poor skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra had prepared several spells in advance, ready to be unleashed at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Razen, for example, could only prepare one or two at most, but Gadra could have three or more spells constantly ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A transfer spell for escape, and a self-destructive spell for suicide. He had never left out a reincarnation spell, just in case he died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was a cautious person, but this time, something unexpected had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Reincarnation&rsquo; was triggered, and his soul slipped out of his body. Protected by magic, the soul was supposed to return to the Wheel of Reincarnation in search of a new body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, a promise had been made at this point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, Gadra had applied to be Diablo&rsquo;s disciple, but that had been put on hold. Normally, this would have been an instant rejection, but Gadra had been favored by Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By praising Rimuru&rsquo;s magic, Diablo had taken a liking to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike interesting guys like you. Once I recognize that you are truly useful to Rimuru-sama, I will take you in as my dependent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what he had told him at the banquet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra had thought it was a polite excuse to refuse him, but he was still planning to do his best to be accepted by Diablo. However, by that time, he had been taken by Diablo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Temptation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, Gadra&rsquo;s &lsquo;Reincarnation&rsquo; was rewritten. If he chose to die for Rimuru, he would be reborn as a demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And demons were a race born with the ability to fight. Because Gadra possessed a lifetime of his memories, it was only natural that he was born as a special individual after becoming a demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem was his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A demon, a spiritual life form, needed a body to stay in this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, Gadra would have had to possess someone, or contact Diablo and wait for him to summon him. However, with the birth of Ciel in Rimuru&rsquo;s mind, the fate of the world was decided here as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;If you want a physical body, I will give it to you. I will also give you more power. That&rsquo;s why&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice told him to be of service to Rimuru-sama.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From Gadra&rsquo;s perspective, this was the best thing that could ever happen to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Of course&rsquo;&mdash;he shouted at the top of his lungs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, the contract was concluded and Gadra was successfully reincarnated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was reborn as a new race, a Metal Demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to prove himself as a black dependent, his body was clad in black. His hair, eyes, and bare skin all had black components. Even so, he had a metallic luster, giving him a somewhat artificial atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this figure was not the original Gadra&rsquo;s appearance, but rather a replica of his younger self&mdash;his first life before being reborn. It was recreated from the memories engraved in his soul and had nothing to do with his race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps because he was of a new race, he did not have the limitations of the demon race. Gadra&rsquo;s current magicule count was comparable to Clayman is his rampant state</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Add to that the knowledge and experience he had before he was reborn, and there was no doubt that he had become much stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra himself also felt that he had been reborn. As if to savor the emotion, he couldn&rsquo;t help but be talkative and speak to Gozarin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In other words, you&rsquo;ve become something unheard of like a metal demon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is. Be warned, I have gotten stronger. You do not stand a chance, so surrender. As a former colleague, I will spare your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All I have to say is that you&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin, who was well-prepared and waiting for an opportunity, rushed towards Gadra. The tremendous speed turned Gozarin&rsquo;s body into a massive bullet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way that Gadra would be able to deal with this. Gozarin thought as such, but the next moment, her eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To her surprise, she deviated from Gadra&rsquo;s direction without any intention of her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mysterious, isn&rsquo;t it? Well, to put it simply, I manipulated the magnetic field with magic to create a powerful magnetic field. By passing an electric current through it, it is possible to electromagnetically induce an object as you can see now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, the object was Gozarin. For Gadra, who studied the science of the Otherworld, there were many things he could do with magic. In other words, Gozarin&rsquo;s inner workings could be easily sealed by Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Standing aloofly, Gadra held a large book in his left hand. He was carefully flipping through the pages with his right hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well? Now do you understand what I can do? You should give up and surrender.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin took these words as a sign of condescension. Gadra didn&rsquo;t mean it that way, but Gozarin&rsquo;s pride as a powerful opponent had been hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was why surrender was not an option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well. I didn&rsquo;t want to use this, but I&rsquo;ve come to my senses!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gozarin swallowed the pill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She activated the Medical Skill, &lsquo;The Beast.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Baraga had, Gozarin was about to gain great power. But there was no reason for Gadra to wait for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. In that case, I will let you be the test subject for my new powers!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra gleefully looked at Gozarin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes were those of a scientist looking at a guinea pig.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Book of Sorcery (Grimoire)&rsquo;&mdash;Activate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The book in Gadra&rsquo;s left hand gave off an ominous glow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The book contained a number of spells that Rimuru&mdash;in other words, Ciel&mdash;managed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking at the beautiful formulas in the book, Gadra&rsquo;s face was filled with ecstasy. He then chose the spell that seemed most appropriate for this moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Limited Hellflare</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a martial art created by Benimaru but turned into a Skill by Rimuru. Since magic was a type of Skill, it was also mentioned in the &lsquo;Grimoire&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it was not as powerful as the one used by the person who created it, its power was perfect. Gozarin was unable to understand what happened and was burned irreproducible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish I could have showed off more, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra muttered, trying to stroke his proud beard. But it was smooth, without even a trace of stubble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh no! Have I become a young man in appearance? That&rsquo;s troubling. My hair is black. I&rsquo;ll have to dye it&hellip;No, I&rsquo;ll use transformation magic to get through this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra muttered to himself, happily flipping through the &lsquo;Grimoire.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Vega had grown to the point where he could stand alongside Gladium, who had been over two meters tall, and his uniform was puffed up with swollen muscles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, not bad&hellip;but it&rsquo;s still not enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega muttered to himself, but after that, he found more and more delicious-looking food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was the charred &ldquo;Vermillion Bird&rdquo; Nazim, the dead &ldquo;Azure Dragon&rdquo; Baraga with a huge hole in his chest, and the metal remnants of &ldquo;Black Tortoise&rdquo; Gozarin which were all that remained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sneaking up quietly, Vega devoured his prey one by one, so quickly that no one noticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was able to do this thanks to the power of his Unique Skill &lsquo;Evil Eater&rsquo;&mdash;a special power he was born with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega was born in the royal capital of Ingracia. Unbeknownst to him, Vega was the result of magical inquisitors, who&rsquo;s parent was turned into a monster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His father, who had taken in so much of the monster factor that he could no longer return, attacked his mother, and Vega was born. Therefore, Vega was born a heretic. He was only in his mother&rsquo;s womb for about three days, and he had an ego from the day he was born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, as a baby without reason and without understanding language, he was feared as a monster by his mother and others around him. Instead of being loved, he was almost killed and went into hiding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Over the next dozen years, Vega survived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He ate rats, scavenged leftovers, and ate whatever he could to survive. Eventually, he ate a man who was dying after a fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then he understood.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was surrounded by so much food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega became a veritable monster, feeding even on humans. Naturally, a subjugation order was issued, but Yuuki was the one in charge of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the help of Shizue Izawa, who was already teaching as an instructor at the time, Yuuki succeeded in capturing Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He should have been executed, but Yuuki thought that Vega&rsquo;s strength was too valuable. He had a great sense of combat, and a strong body. In addition, he thought that Vega had potential for growth and could be used as a useful pawn if trained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki tricked Shizu into believing that he had disposed of Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega was then trained in the Empire through Damrada. And now, he had grown into a fearsome warrior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately for Vega, the battle between the Devil Chevaliers and Chimera Knights, who came as reinforcements, was getting fiercer. This allowed him to accomplish his goal in a covert manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had the limbs of a mighty beast, a body of hard magisteel, the power of a dragon that could repel magic, and even wings that could fly through the sky. Vega received them all in a short time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only that, but he also picked up the mythical-grade Azure Dragon Spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was not yet recognized as its master, but Vega did not care. He poured all of his strength into making it obey and forcibly fused them together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Gozarin&rsquo;s power&mdash;the effect of &lsquo;metal manipulation&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By taking in the mythical-grade weapon, Vega&rsquo;s whole body changed into something even more horrible. The extraordinary armor that covered his entire body made him an unidentifiable majin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Gabil and the others noticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?! There is still such a dangerous majin around?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil shouted in surprise, and his subordinates could not help complaining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Gabil-sama, don&rsquo;t we already have our hands full?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been fighting battle after battle, and our supplies are running low. What should we do, Gabil-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was understandable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, the Hiryuu&rsquo;s fatigue was nearing its limit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the Devil Chevaliers had come even a little later, their battle line would have collapsed long ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, the Beast Master&rsquo;s Warrior Alliance and the Tensh&#333;sh&#363;, who were expected to be reliable reinforcements, were the first to leave the front lines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh no&rdquo;&mdash;Suphia had said back then. And that was just the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Gabil asked what was wrong, Suphia replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sleepy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing that, Gabil also understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He realized that the evolutionary slumber, an essential part of the Harvest Festival, had started at the worst possible time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Karion and Frey were about to awaken, this was just a natural consequence. There was no point in complaining about this irresistible physiological phenomenon. That is why Gabil and the others struggled alone to protect this place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other troops were engaging the enemy at their own discretion. However, Gabil and his subordinates could not move from this place. That is why the fatigue was even more intense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil&rsquo;s face paled at Vega&rsquo;s appearance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please rest assured, Gabil-dono. I will go talk to him first. He is called Vega, and is one of Yuuki&rsquo;s partners.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How reliable, Gabil was impressed with Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They smiled and nodded at each other, having somehow become friends. Gadra then stepped forward towards Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Vega, it&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Ah, old man Gadra. I had heard that you turned over to the Demon Lord Rimuru, but it looks like it was true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm-hmm. That is why I&rsquo;m in league with Yuuki. It&rsquo;s good to see you here. If it weren&rsquo;t for me, you would be considered an enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra approached him in a friendly manner, but Vega gave him a disinterested glance. He quickly averted his gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Vega&rsquo;s view, there were now people more interesting than Gadra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In his line of sight were Karion and Frey. Around them, too, he could see tasty-looking food lying around. Vega&rsquo;s mouth was full of drool, and he had an ecstatic expression, imagining the taste of the meat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am going to be the mediator here, and you will assist with&mdash;bwah?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s fist swatted away Gadra&rsquo;s attempt at a friendly tap on the shoulder. Caught off guard, Gadra took it in stride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega&rsquo;s power had now been strengthened to the point where it surpassed that of an awakened demon lord. Compared to Gadra, his magicule count was more than double.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Gadra, who had become a metal demon with excellent physical defense, was no match for Vega, whose entire body was made of magisteel and who had also taken in mythical-grade armament. With a single blow, Gadra&rsquo;s consciousness was snuffed out and he was silenced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ga-Gadra-dono!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he shouted, Gabil thought to himself that Gadra-dono was also an unreliable man. Gadra&rsquo;s confidence had been so strong that it could not be helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was greatly disappointed because his hopes had been crushed. Moreover, Vega&rsquo;s ability was beyond his imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega was licking his lips at Karion and Frey, as if he has no intention of hiding it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His intention was clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they didn&rsquo;t defeat him here, it would only give him more power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He still didn&rsquo;t know if he could beat him even now, and if that was true, there was nothing he could do about it. There was no doubt that Gabil had no chance of winning, so he had no choice but to do his best here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I&rsquo;ve always wanted to stand out, but it&rsquo;s no use if it happens this way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was feeling a little sorry for himself as he self-reflected.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Aren&rsquo;t you Laplace-dono? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace almost replied that he was left behind by everyone else, but then he fell silent. He realized that saying it would be awkward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to say it. I&rsquo;m here to save you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-Oh, wow!! That&rsquo;s so reassuring, Laplace-dono!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Now that I&rsquo;m here, there&rsquo;s no need to worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace forced the conversation to a conclusion. Then, he turned to Vega, who was supposed to be his comrade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Vega-san. Why did you hit old man Gadra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace asked Vega as he twirled around lightly. Vega, looking annoyed at Laplace, answered in a troublesome manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? It&rsquo;s obvious, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s because that old man was trying to get in my way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In your way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Anyone who tries to interfere with my meal shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to live. So, Laplace, why don&rsquo;t you just stay out of it? Then I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook for old times sake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace stopped twirling around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny joke you&rsquo;re making. You haven&rsquo;t forgotten your place now, have you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tone of his voice was almost the same as before. However, the atmosphere was so tense that it was no exaggeration to say that something had shifted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vega didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah, my position? You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s in no position to give me orders! I heard that Yuuki lost to Rudra. I only listen to orders from people who are stronger than me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he said that, Vega started laughing loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of his laughter echoed across the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t laugh. Your jokes are not funny.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a joke&mdash;Kwa?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The vulgar laughter suddenly stopped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an instant, Laplace closed the distance and grabbed Vega by the neck.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate people, or I&rsquo;ll kick your ass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace lifted up the body which was more than twice his size.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega struggled, his arms and legs jerking around. He no longer needed to breathe, but he was confused because he wasn&rsquo;t used to it yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s when Laplace unleashed a knee strike that exploded against Vega. Vega, who had been grabbed by the neck, had no way to escape even if he was pulled back. As Laplace loosened his grip, Vega cowered in place, trying to catch his breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-wait, wait. I&rsquo;m sorry I got carried away. I&rsquo;ve cooled down now, so please forgive me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was about to kick Vega in the head but stopped when he saw Vega pleading. Then, in a cold voice, he spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m not as nice as the boss. Don&rsquo;t expect a second chance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then, you&rsquo;ll have to follow me like an adult. Well, if you do anything, I&rsquo;ll have no choice but to stop you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega nodded his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got it. So, what&rsquo;s the plan now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go where the President is. As long as the President is saved, Teare and Footman will be back to normal. Anyway, if we don&rsquo;t find a solution, we&rsquo;ll never get the boss out. So, don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega nodded widely at Laplace&rsquo;s words. His desperate attitude suggested that he was scared of Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Vega that way, Laplace let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is this going to be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra, who had just gotten up, muttered worriedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Old man!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega stared at him while postured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, Gadra-dono! You&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was surprised but happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As expected, so the old man was safe?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was not surprised, as if he had been expecting this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. I was unconscious for a moment, but I&rsquo;m well prepared for an emergency evacuation. I was pretending to be attacked, hoping to catch you off guard and cast a massive spell on you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, the Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Grimoire&rsquo; had &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parallelism&rsquo; as a matter of course. By using these features, even if he lost conscious, another back-up thought will take over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. I was fooled, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re great old man, seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well. I haven&rsquo;t lived this long in vain. More importantly, the problem is Vega.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace tried to dodge the subject, but Gadra was having none of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why not?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega began acting like he couldn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed by this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shrugged his shoulders and replied as if to remind them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be honest, I don&rsquo;t trust him either. But this guy is also one of ours. I know you think we should kill him, but I want to believe in him. Besides, we can&rsquo;t do anything without the boss&rsquo;s permission. If he becomes too much next time, we will listen to you. Let&rsquo;s see if we can forgive him for once and give him a chance to be trusted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a headache, Laplace thought bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vega was too stupid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s too loyal to his own desires, and he wasn&rsquo;t good at reading the atmosphere. But that didn&rsquo;t mean he didn&rsquo;t have his good points. He was not the type who worked best in a group, but he obeyed orders to a certain extent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides, he was strong. It would be a waste of resources to get rid of him here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although he was worried that his occasional problematic behavior might exceed the acceptable range&hellip; Laplace thought that he should accompany and take care of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, too, it had ended in an attempt, but it had been a step closer to a big problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he had messed with Karion and the others, Laplace would have taken action against Vega without protecting him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be honest, even if it was only an attempt, it was still a serious matter&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the authority to make decisions, but I understand how you feel. I&rsquo;m not a stranger after all, and as long as you don&rsquo;t cause trouble for Rimuru-sama, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra was also someone who knew Vega. He thought it would be inappropriate for him to speak here, so he only gave a conservative opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about that too&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace was also worried, but it was said in a slurred voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil was the only one who laughed out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! A man can learn a lot from his mistakes. All right. I will choose to believe in you too! Vega, as you&rsquo;ve said, listen to Laplace-dono well and become a great warrior!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Gabil clapped Vega on the back.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite his misgivings, now was not the time to stop and worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laplace walked away quickly, taking Vega with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was that the right thing to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. If Vega grows, it will be profitable, and if he fails, Laplace-dono will take the blame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;You&rsquo;ve got a darker streak in your heart than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! I won&rsquo;t get anything in return despite your praise!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gadra thought that he wasn&rsquo;t praising him, but it was too much trouble to say, so he kept silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The atmosphere relaxed a bit, but they were still in the middle of a battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remembering this, they tried to change their minds and face the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s when the good news came in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Brother! Moss-dono has informed me that Rimuru-sama has defeated Velgrynd-sama. It seems that the executives have boarded the enemy airship and are now engaged in a decisive battle with the main force of the enemy. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souka, who had returned to the front after a break, reported the current situation with a loud voice. As a result, the morale of Rimuru&rsquo;s forces rose significantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the contrary, the Imperial Army was in turmoil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aside from those who had lost their will and were running rampant, the Chimera Knights who had been the core of the force, realized how bad of a situation they were in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had lost their commander and could not expect any more reinforcements. And yet, the enemy reinforcements keep increasing, and it was hopeless to defeat the enemy commander.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they insisted on defeating the ex-demon lord who had shown his weakness on the battlefield, they would probably be surrounded and annihilated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone had been in control, it would have been a different story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, as it was, there was no commander.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was natural for some of them to run away, thinking that things would not go well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the contrary, Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates were overjoyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uoooooo, as expected of His Majesty Rimuru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-He defeated Velgrynd-sama?! I can&rsquo;t believe it, but I guess it should be expected of Rimuru-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s won. From here on, it&rsquo;s time to overrun the battle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Gabil and Gadra were no exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How wonderful! After all, Rimuru-sama is of a different class!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, yes. I&rsquo;ve been wondering about him as well since I suddenly became so strong. That voice must be related to Rimuru-sama after all, as Diablo-sama had surmised&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you say something, Gadra-dono?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing. Rather, let us finish our work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Prying too much would only get himself killed. Gadra was well aware of this, so he decided not to pursue the matter too deeply. Another reason was that he thought it would be a bad idea to get Gabil involved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil nodded at Gadra&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gabil turned his thoughts to the battlefield and gave the order to charge with the loudest voice of the day.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><h2 class="c30" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c32 c14 c22 c17">Chapter 4</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c13 c21">The Eight Gates</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">After Laplace left, Diablo was the only one left in the room. He smiled and was glad that everything had gone as planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He watched the battle of his beloved Lord up close and was planning to use it as a reference for his own future usefulness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was truly grateful for the opportunity to look into whatever his Lord lacked and figure out how he could make up for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">No, rather, there is nothing that can be lacking in Rimuru-sama. What is important here is to find out how I can best take action in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how his mind wandered, Diablo would only think about how he could be useful to Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the other reason he hadn&rsquo;t entered the war was because of another intention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">If I participate in the war, I will not struggle against anyone but Velgrynd-sama. That would be a waste, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rare opportunity to fight a strong opponent should be used effectively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Diablo&rsquo;s view, Benimaru was showing signs of growth. He had greatly increased his strength through evolution, and the shortest way to hone that strength was to fight strong opponents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not only the case for Benimaru, but for all the executives who had been given power by Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And on this battlefield, just the right opponents were waiting. Diablo thought that there was no reason to not take advantage of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Well, it seems that Benimaru-dono also saw through my thoughts, but judging from the fact that he didn&rsquo;t complain, I guess he was planning to do this from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, despite his appearance, was surprisingly belligerent. He tended to enjoy fighting with the strong, though not as much as Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I look forward to seeing him grow,&rsquo; Diablo thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he survived this battle, he would gain more power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But more importantly&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s orders are absolute. No one is allowed to die, so there is no choice but to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had to make sure that no one died and that they survived to be reborn stronger. For that purpose, Diablo had no intention to spare any cooperation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Power that was given to you was meaningless. It would only shine if it was acquired and mastered by oneself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This would be the stage for that transformation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Give them an enemy and crush them. The growth that lied ahead was what Rimuru desired&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Diablo thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Kufufufufu. Aside from Testarossa, even Carrera and Ultima have been seen to be fighting with too much force. In particular, Carrera is a problem. It would be a good experience to learn what it is like to struggle in a fight here. Make sure you survive. If you don&rsquo;t, I really will kill you. Kufufufufufufu&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Diablo thought about this and laughed even more happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His excitement reached its peak as he witnessed the battle between Rimuru and Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The day when our empire unites the whole world is near.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Long live His Majesty the Emperor, hurrah!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Glory to His Majesty the Emperor!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the deck, which was not a very large space, they expressed their feelings to each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, all at once, they fixed their eyes on the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;ve arrived. The Demon lord&rsquo;s subordinates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your defeat was already decided once the evil dragon Veldora was taken from you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of them mocked the enemy, but most of them fell silent and drew their swords.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason was simple and obvious. The people coming towards them were recognized as a real &ldquo;threat.&rdquo; They prepared themselves for a decisive battle and moved to intercept them. However, they just didn&rsquo;t know it yet. They had no idea that despair was just around the corner. And once they realized it, their lives would be over.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa flew gracefully through the air, a sorrowful expression on her face, as if she were not amused. She had witnessed the people who were her targets foolishly holding their swords on the airship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. They&rsquo;re too stupid to challenge us as soon as they see us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru remained silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He would have agreed with her, but he thought it was still natural to do so from the enemy&rsquo;s standpoint. That is why he kept silent without agreeing to Testarossa&rsquo;s statement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was also why Benimaru was still considered within the realms of a sensible</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were those who were truly outrageous and abnormal in their thought processes. As if to prove this, Testarossa took action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is foolish to misjudge the strong. It is so pathetic, so let us give them the blessing of mercy without fear!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In truth, Testarossa had intended to go on a bit of a rampage, show off her skills, and feed off of the emotions of those who feared her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it would take a long time to terrify someone who was already prepared. That would have been troublesome and, more than anything, would have deviated from the purpose of the mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, she decided to eliminate the obstacles swiftly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without hesitation, Testarossa unleashed a spell that would cover the entire airship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The spell was nuclear magic: &lsquo;Death Streak.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ultimate forbidden magic, which destroyed the soul, unleashed its ruthless fury. As a result, a jet-black sphere was formed so as to envelop the entire airship, bringing death to those inside.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost everyone inside the ship was killed from the demonic death rays that killed all life forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Major General Zamud, who had finished contacting Gladium and was busy preparing for the battle, died before even understanding what had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had no luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Rimuru could have afforded it, he would have remembered Calgurio&rsquo;s plea for life and instructed her not to involve Zamud and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But alas, reality was cruel, and all beings were equal in the face of death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So sudden. I ordered a preemptive strike, but I guess they&rsquo;re out of their depth here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying very hard so that you don&rsquo;t have to bother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense. Rather, you&rsquo;re thinking, &lsquo;in order not to have your prey taken away&rsquo;, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa laughed in amusement at Benimaru&rsquo;s remark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;ve seen through me, haven&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s Benimaru-sama for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since I was not happy about a compliment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they were bantering, there were no problems. In fact, Benimaru was glad she had saved them from the trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the two late comers who complained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahh! I wished you had left some for us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I made a bad choice. I should have just left Diablo alone and given priority to this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima and Carrera stared at Testarossa bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa simply returned a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You both are not ready for this. Look around you carefully for signs. There are some who survived still out there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Anyone who can be killed by an attack like that is not good enough for me. Rather, I should praise you for selecting them well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You flatter me, Shion-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa smiled, knowing exactly what was meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The expression on her face eloquently told them that those who were aware could understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only the magically suitable or spiritual life forms could withstand the &lsquo;Death Streak&rsquo;. With a bit of luck, even a &ldquo;sage&rdquo; class would be able to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Regardless, if anyone was still alive on the ship, it was safe to assume that they were strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima and Carrera were frustrated, but it was not their place to complain. Realizing that, they decided to back off sincerely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Benimaru&rsquo;s command, the raid operation began.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The fact that their bodies were still intact was evidence of their desperate resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the end of the line for those who would even be called champions in a great nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to die&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were those who reached for the sky as if clinging to life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But their lifespans were as good as expired. No remedy or restoration magic could help them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their fate had been sealed the moment they became Testarossa&rsquo;s enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jeez! I still think it&rsquo;s a waste. If they were of such high quality, they could have sung a sweet hymn</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so selfish. Look, they are here to welcome us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa pointed to the bow of the flagship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Located there were those who were at the top of the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emperor Rudra and Velgrynd, who was still sleeping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Flanking them, were Kondou and Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind Rudra, there were four other men and women.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was also another quiet-looking man who was standing next to Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is an honor to be greeted by the Emperor himself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Benimaru spoke in a fearless manner, Kondou and Damrada&mdash;not Rudra, tried to step forward. But Rudra stopped them with one hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I will admit it. These are the only pawns I have left after more than 2,000 years of work. On behalf of the Demon Lord Rimuru, I will at least allow you a straight answer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, what is the purpose of you coming here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, well that&rsquo;s a simple story. Although I do not have the full authority, I will make demands on Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s behalf. From this moment on, cease all fighting and surrender unconditionally. If you accept, we will stop our pursuit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And if I refuse?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then I have been ordered by Rimuru-sama to annihilate you. Until one side is completely destroyed, it will be a full-on battle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;We&rsquo;re not allowed to die though&rsquo;&mdash;Benimaru added inwardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His voice never faltered, and Benimaru&rsquo;s attitude was one of arrogance. It was no wonder that the Imperials were embarrassed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How insolent!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco shouted, as if it was unintentional.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The arrogance of an ignorant maggot who knows nothing of the world. You are a fool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the four knights carrying a spear muttered to Benimaru as if looking down on him. This naturally reached Benimaru&rsquo;s ears, but he kept his gaze fixed on Rudra, as if he had no intention of dealing with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The others remained silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra was the one who had the right to make the decision, and since Rudra had allowed him to answer directly, they thought it would be impolite for them to interfere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous. My ambition will not end here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If so, then die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was now more thoughtful and less temperamental, but his true nature was that of a raging divine oni. He preferred to use force rather than to engage in long negotiations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Besides&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no reason for him to retreat now that Rimuru had ordered him to kill all of his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then there was a flashpoint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the midst of this atmosphere, there was one person who made a move. Velgrynd, who had been asleep, opened her eyes and jumped up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rudra!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? What is happening that has made even you so upset?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd took a glance around her and realized what was going on here. Still, she decided that her business was more important and began to speak, ignoring Benimaru and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; has been captured by Demon Lord Rimuru. It&rsquo;s going to take me a few minutes to break the barriers, so I decided to bring my power back here first&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was at this very moment&mdash;Rimuru had sealed Velgrynd in his &lsquo;Insulation Prison&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd had thought that there was still plenty of room for leeway, but she felt threatened by the presence of the three demon girls in addition to Benimaru and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Rimuru-sama for you! We can&rsquo;t afford to lose to them either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion was pleased and excited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He seems to be concentrating on Veldora-sama right now. Rimuru-sama will surely bring Veldora-sama back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei also nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had quietly left a &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; to confirm Rimuru&rsquo;s safety. That was just the type of man Souei was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s able to fight against Velgrynd-sama and Veldora-sama at the same time, and still be more than evenly matched. How impressive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He really is. Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t expect him to be this strong either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Milord is truly unfathomable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having been aware of Velgrynd&rsquo;s strength, the three demon girls took that statement to heart. To be honest, the three of them were still filled with disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was a big mistake. We should not have been fooled by Diablo&rsquo;s sweet words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. He knew this was going to happen, so he just wanted to observe. That&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To a demon, cowardice was also a compliment, but Shion heard this and decided to pursue Diablo on this later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei, who was also observing, remained calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Benimaru was quietly looking away. This was because he had used Moss to watch Rimuru&rsquo;s fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, the Imperials were in turmoil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! He has that much power?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emperor Rudra, who was normally a calm and collected man who never showed his emotions, could not help but stand up and shout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had heeded Kondou&rsquo;s advice and highly evaluated Rimuru. However, there was no doubt that he had underestimated Rimuru, thinking that he would not be as much of a threat as Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if he realized it now, it was still too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou also realized that he had made a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had felt wary when his attack had failed, but that had not been enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">No matter what happens, I will protect His Majesty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without saying a word, he made up his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the beginning, Damrada had believed that Demon Lord Rimuru was a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not a matter of logic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A man as cunning as Yuuki, even with all his scheming, was unable to take advantage of him. That alone made him a dangerous opponent that could not be left alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something different about Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yuuki was the same, and so was Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who wore a kind of supreme energy that could be called charisma. They were the ones who fascinated Damrada, and the ones who gave him a sense of mysterious possibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada had a distant promise made to Emperor Rudra. Damrada did not know if he should keep it or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why Damrada entrusted his fate to others instead of himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who were worthy of being entrusted with it&mdash;those who had something in them that made him think that way were shining beings like Yuuki and Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Demon Lord Rimuru, who was one of those existences, was enraged to the point of blowing away his reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That fact made Damrada feel uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had a feeling something was going to happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Rudra had said, the best of the Empire&rsquo;s forces were assembled on the bridge. Gladium and his men were nowhere to be seen, but the reality was that no more reinforcements could be expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, they were unable to overwhelm Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, Demon Lord Rimuru was not an opponent to be taken lightly. This was evident from the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damrada kept his guard up and tensed all his nerves so that he could immediately protect the Emperor no matter what happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other four knights and Marco were also having a hard time keeping their composure due to the unexpected situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power of an Absolute such as Velgrynd was unfathomable, even for someone as powerful as them. Such a Velgrynd had recognized the power of Demon Lord Rimuru. It was impossible not to be confused.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this time, both sides were astonished in opposite ways, but it was Velgrynd who broke that atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You said it would be a full-on battle, correct? All right. I will defeat you and use you as bargaining chips for the Demon Lord Rimuru. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well. Prove your power to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Rudra made his decision, the agitation of the Imperial Knights disappeared. His voice was full of strength and it brought peace to the hearts of the warriors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I promise you victory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd also spoke with a fierce smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The beautiful yet terrifying smile on her face foreshadowed the horrors of the battle to come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay with that, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. We will win this battle and put an end to any future disasters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay. Then have a good fight&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she said that, Velgrynd opened her hands and held them up to the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she invoked the &lsquo;Eight Gate Formation.&rsquo; Eight gates appeared in the sky, lining up in the center of the two camps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of the gates, which had shrunk to the size of a man&rsquo;s body, Velgrynd explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On this flagship, I have isolated us in an alternate universe I&rsquo;ve created. If you want to escape, you will have to destroy all of these gates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were eight Imperials here, not including Rudra. That meant that each of them would be guarding one gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What happens if we all enter one gate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting question. You can try it, but once inside the gate, only the person who killed the guardian of the gate will be eligible to enter the next gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that was true, then if they all went in, only one of them would be left to challenge the next gate. Since they couldn&rsquo;t escape without destroying all the gates, that choice would be too risky of a gamble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. If you&rsquo;re going to do this, then it&rsquo;s only right that we all go in together when we challenge the last remaining gate, correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very clever. If you&rsquo;re going to challenge the gate I am guarding, then that is probably the right thing to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd nodded with a smile at what Benimaru pointed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She must have seen that coming. Even so, she was confident that she would not be defeated, which was why she presented those conditions from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;However, it is precisely because I have set such conditions that this otherworld can be maintained at low cost. You cannot escape without destroying all of the gates, and you cannot touch Rudra. Or would you prefer that we fight an all-out war here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either way, Velgrynd proclaimed as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The defenders were at a disadvantage when guarding the Eight Gates. Since information about the guardians of the gates would be known, there was a risk that the enemy would take precautions against the challenge. But if it became an all-out battle, Rudra would be in danger. Velgrynd&rsquo;s true intention was to avoid just that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She also wanted to capture Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates in the otherworld. Velgrynd was willing to accept some disadvantages in order to bring the battle to an alternate space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll accept that match.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru responded without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Upon hearing this, Velgrynd was convinced of victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Unless I lose, this otherworld will not be broken. In other words, our victory is unassailable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Velgrynd was confident that she would win even if they all challenged her at once. That is why she chose the safest strategy, the &lsquo;Eight Gate Formation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, too, was aware of Velgrynd&rsquo;s intentions. However, even if he refused here, he would not be able to avoid a fight with Velgrynd, so he decided that it would be better to choose the option with the best chance of success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this place, the intentions of both parties coincided, and the location for the final battle was decided.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

Nobody would be so foolish as to overlook that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a cowardly thing to do. Now we don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s guarding which gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Shion who said that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;It&rsquo;s fine. I remember.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&lsquo;You idiot, you didn&rsquo;t even look at it properly, right?&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Benimaru swallowed those words. He felt that he could understand Diablo&rsquo;s hardships a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufu, what fun entertainment. If you are victorious, then you will have the honor of fighting me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra, protected by the laws of the otherworld, said this as he sat comfortably in his chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rudra did not doubt Velgrynd&rsquo;s victory. It was clear from his demeanor that he thought of this battle only as mere entertainment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that what you think? You never know what will happen in a battle. I&rsquo;ll show you that there are some things we cannot compromise on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru spoke boldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, he looked around at the faces of his companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was trying to figure out who should go against whom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was one person who could not wait for Benimaru&rsquo;s decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been patiently enduring all this time, but that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hey?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama said to kill all the enemies. In that case, we don&rsquo;t need to worry and should just get rid of them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaving aside the question of whether or not she was feeling troubled, he couldn&rsquo;t allow her to do this without permission&mdash;Benimaru thought about this, but before he could stop Shion, she had kicked down the door and entered the gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;It&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t know if it was by choice or by chance, but it looks like she picked the right person.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s actions tended to lead to optimal results. Although there were problems this time, she chose the door that matched Benimaru&rsquo;s intentions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there were seven doors left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of them was Velgrynd&rsquo;s, which needed to be used last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question was who would be the right people to deal with whom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;May I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Veyron who offered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Ultima who asked with a chilling presence in her voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The truth is, I haven&rsquo;t finished my fight with Marco yet. I believe I can guarantee you victory now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Defeating a beatable opponent was a standard practice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea to leave it to him, since he could leave if he won. Benimaru decided as such and gave his permission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll leave Marco to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm, that&rsquo;s fine. If Benimaru-san says so, I have no problem with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima calmed her anger, and Veyron&rsquo;s partner was chosen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing the exchange, Agera was the next to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, I have a favor to ask.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was Agera, correct? What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, there is someone whom I&rsquo;m not so sure if I have a history with, although I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be a good match. If it&rsquo;s possible, I&rsquo;d like to deal with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A man named Kondou. It seems that he is a kindred spirit of mine, and as a pure swordsman, he is an opponent I cannot ignore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It sounded like there was a connection, Benimaru thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was curious about Agera&rsquo;s school of swordsmanship, and he knew that Hakurou was interested in Agera as well. In that case, he wanted to fulfill his wish, but there was a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you confident that you can win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, if Agera lost, there would be no point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Benimaru&rsquo;s opinion, Lieutenant Kondou was a troublesome man. Even Rimuru had been wary of him, so he knew that Agera would have trouble beating him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera stammered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a swordsman, he would have no regrets even if he lost. But that would be an act against Rimuru&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera also understood that his offer was selfish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Agera received a helping hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, Agera. It&rsquo;s unusual for you to be so selfish, so I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agera&rsquo;s lord, she said this with dignity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He did not ask Carrera if she could win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you can beat this Kondou guy or not. I won&rsquo;t tell you not to lose, but you must not die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Carrera smiled widely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. And, yes, you&rsquo;re right. Let&rsquo;s give Agera a test. We need to see if winning will really open the next gate, and I think it&rsquo;s better to experiment on the weakest opponent anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Agreed! Shion-san&rsquo;s gone, but even if we win, it won&rsquo;t matter if we can&rsquo;t fight again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right. If that&rsquo;s the case, we&rsquo;ll have to challenge Velgrynd-sama with only qualified players. Though, Velgrynd-sama is a proud person, so I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s lying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, Benimaru had considered this possibility. He had planned to have Shion try it when she returned, but if she wanted to try it with Agera, there was no reason to stop her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is that plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put Agera in the lead, with Esprit as a backup. That way we can find out if the next challenge is really only for those who have killed the enemy inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re at it, take Zonda. He&rsquo;s a healer, so he&rsquo;s useless against the strong opponents.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zonda was not weak, but he was no match for a Saint-class opponent. Therefore, Ultima decided that it would not be a problem if he could not challenge again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t have to go to the dangerous battlefield and could just heal those who came out here. Because of this, there was no objection from anyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, Agera, Esprit, Zonda, the three of you, go attack this gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru pointed to the gate that one of the four knights had entered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the big man with the spear on his back who had looked down on Benimaru and scorned him as a maggot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru was tempted to turn him into charcoal with his own hands, but he decided to let Agera and the others do the job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please leave it to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I promise you, we will return victorious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the three of them dove through the gate and went into battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, the attack on two of the gates began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest of them remained calm, waiting for Benimaru to tell them who should attack where next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the time Agera and the others return, we will decide who among each of us should attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gate being guarded by Velgrynd would be postponed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kondou&rsquo;s opponent would be Carrera, and Marco&rsquo;s opponent would be Veyron.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That left Damrada and two of the four knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;From what I can tell, the man who appears to be the leader of those four knights seems to be the strongest. I think I&rsquo;ll deal with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have no objections. I had the same impression.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that case, can I take on that Damrada guy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already chosen my opponent, so I have no complaints.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strength of Damrada and the remaining four knights did not seem to differ that much. If so, there would be no complaints from Benimaru either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. The only ones left are the four knights who use double swords. They seem to be a good match for me, so no problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After saying that, Benimaru was silent for a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, embarrassed, he continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Even though it&rsquo;s all come to this, there&rsquo;s something troubling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei asked, to which Benimaru responded while scratching his cheek.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t share our names with each other, so I don&rsquo;t know their names. I remember who was guarding which gate, so it not much of problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed, that was a blind spot. Well, don&rsquo;t worry about it. Since it&rsquo;s going to be a battle anyway, it should be enough to know the name of the one we&rsquo;re going to kill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those who had been listening to the conversation between Benimaru and Souei nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Names&rdquo; were important to monsters, but they were enemy&rsquo;s either way. The demons and others thought that there was no need to worry about it so much.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

I suppose it&rsquo;s only natural as they have come to deal with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Holding the spear on his back in his right hand, the man let out a vile laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Before you die, I&rsquo;ll tell you my name. I am Garcia-sama, the fifth in rank and one of the four knights who protect the Emperor! You demons, get a good taste of the honor of fighting me and disappear from this world!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that shout, Garcia swung his Legendary-grade spear, which was probably as close to mythical-grade as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power of the spear was so great that it could wipe out even a spiritual life form with just a graze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Agera and the others kept a cool face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have no interest in your name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This guy is an idiot. He called Benimaru-sama a maggot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s capable of so that he can speak so brazenly. If it were me, I would be so embarrassed that I&rsquo;d be in agony for three days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Far from fearing Garcia, they all said whatever they wanted to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia was furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a bunch of small fry who are good at pissing me off. You don&rsquo;t even know what I&rsquo;m capable of, do you? In that case, I&rsquo;ll show you my true power!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After shouting, he released the power he had been holding back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The amount of magicules in a saint-class individual was comparable to that of an awakened demon lord. Even though Agera and the others had evolved into demon peers, the difference was several times greater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clothed in a high density of fighting aura, Garcia took a step forward. With that, the marble floor of the colosseum cracked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prepare yourself. You&rsquo;ll be sorry that you ever offended me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Offended or not, Garcia&rsquo;s actions would have been the same either way. Everyone guessed as much, but no one said anything about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera put his hand on the sword at his waist and took a cautious approach to see how his opponent would react. Even a single blow would inevitably cause serious damage, so he decided to concentrate on defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit was using Agera as a shield and was ready to attack with her magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more Garcia concentrated on Agera, the more Esprit could prepare for a large spell. She seemed to be taking it easy, as if it was a good thing to be able to fight safely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zonda was focused on support. Not only was he good at restoration magic, but he also assisted Agera at key points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be better to work with Zonda than Esprit&mdash;Agera began to secretly think as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia scoffed at the demons&rsquo; tactics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were on the defensive, and their only offense was their stupid magic. It was impossible to damage Garcia with such a fighting style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s why Garcia felt like he had already won and made many condescending remarks to his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah! How cowardly. You may be demons, but you&rsquo;re still no match for us. We, as the strongest of knights, have subdued demons like you many times before! It is said that a demon peer is a legendary demon that rivals a demon lord&hellip; But that&rsquo;s just a story for a frog in the well. To us, you&rsquo;re nothing more than mere ants!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he said this, he slammed his spear into the ground, leaving a huge hole in the marble floor. Of course, Agera and Esprit avoided it without any trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera never got outraged when being mocked. He had not forgotten that this fight was just a prelude to the real thing that was to come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit was more thorough. She was cautious in dealing with her opponent&rsquo;s attacks and hiding behind Agera to avoid taking any damage. Esprit had a Unique Skill, &lsquo;Discerner&rsquo;, which specialized in observation. In fact, by using this Skill, it was possible to keep in touch even with people who were separated by time and space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although there was a restriction that it was limited to personal acquaintances, the only person who could make use of this power was Carrera, so from Esprit&rsquo;s perspective, there were no issues. In fact, if Souei and the others had found out that Esprit possessed such an ability, she might have been forced to do espionage work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Esprit hated working, she had to avoid that. That&rsquo;s why Esprit, as usual, continued to give information to Carrera, while providing appropriate support.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Zonda was evacuating to safe areas as soon as he finished providing support. He understood that he was not a fighter, so he was careful not to get injured as a healer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because of this, Garcia assumed that Agera and the others were running around for their lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They must be afraid of his own power and had no way to do anything about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hah! So that&rsquo;s it. You can&rsquo;t defeat me just by running away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia shouted at them while pulling out his spear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His words were brash and rude, but his ability was undeniably real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The spiritual power that pervaded his large physique was unparalleled even for a Saint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He also possessed the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; granted to him by Emperor Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This enchantment was the power of &lsquo;subjugating and conquering&rsquo;, and it reduced the will of the enemy to defeat them with one&rsquo;s own power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This power was also added to his favorite spear, transforming it into a holy spear of destruction, which could purify all kinds of evil&mdash;even spiritual life forms such as evil spirits and demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needless to say, Garcia&rsquo;s body was being strengthened by the mere act of cursing his enemies. His body was protected by Legendary-grade armor, and he had no need to worry about the recoil of his own power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia had a deep understanding of his own powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While provoking his enemies in this way, he never let his guard down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Garcia had said himself, a demon peer was a legendary super-class demon, comparable to a demon lord. It was a threat of the highest order, not something to be taken lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, Garcia&rsquo;s provocation appeared to be meaningless to Agera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Contempt for human existence was plentiful among the demon race, and if provoked they would immediately lash out. Garcia&rsquo;s rule of thumb was that this would create an opening and make it easier to defeat his opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, however, that was not the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia was irritated by the difficulty of this opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Calm down, human. Your language is vulgar. I don&rsquo;t believe all people to be vulgar, however&hellip;the soul has dignity too. If you have a lowly soul, there is nothing that can be done to hide it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia, who thought he was pretending to be crude, was furious when he was called vulgar. Unaware that this was Agera&rsquo;s own provocation, he lost his momentum and revealed his true nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera, without drawing his sword, continued to evade Garcia&rsquo;s attacks with minimal movement. This injured Garcia&rsquo;s pride even more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit, watching closely, was amazed at Agera&rsquo;s ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">This guy is so good at melee combat, how can he be a demon? He can&rsquo;t even use magic at all, isn&rsquo;t that stupid?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While watching the battle, one would wonder whether she was praising or disparaging him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, this was all being conveyed to Carrera in real time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia, incited by Agera, shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up! I&rsquo;ll kill you all and offer your heads to His Majesty the Emperor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s a bit hasty of you to say. I&rsquo;m a rather tolerant person, but you are just too impatient. Well, not as impatient as Carrera-sama. She is so quick-tempered and simple-minded that she even gives me a hard time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, this sentence of Agera&rsquo;s was also relayed to Carrera through Esprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because Esprit had a bad personality, she didn&rsquo;t tell Agera about her power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">He&rsquo;ll definitely get in trouble later. Teehee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was enjoying herself as if it had nothing to do with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Garcia&rsquo;s next comment froze her expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m impatient? What a bunch of idiots. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed the difference in our abilities yet? Is your master that purple-haired kid? Or is it the cheeky blonde? That white-haired beauty may be famous, but she&rsquo;s still just a frog in a well after all is said and done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Garcia spun his spear around and thrust it right at Agera. Then, as if proud of his victory, he dropped another bombshell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me tell you, ignorant people, that there are real monsters in this world. If you knew the power of Velgrynd-sama, the Lord Marshal&rsquo;s true identity, you would understand the meaning of my words. Besides, Lieutenant Kondou is a terrifying man. Whether it&rsquo;s those demons, or your masters, they&rsquo;re no match for him. You&rsquo;ll just be killed off miserably like the insects you are!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only when Esprit heard this that she finally succeeded in stopping the flow of information that was being sent to Carrera. She had been impatient and took a long time to shut down her Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

This was the first time she had ever been called a frog, and she was filled with unspeakable anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And by the way, he called us insects.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, first we were maggots, and now we&rsquo;re insects?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He muttered in an unamused tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first glance, Benimaru looked calm, but he was still thinking to himself that he should have taken care of things with his own hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei was the only one who was truly calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She is able to maintain a channel in the other world created by Velgrynd-sama? That&rsquo;s an interesting ability.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He crossed his arms and kept silent but remained fixated on Esprit&rsquo;s Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that Souei had found out, Esprit would have to deal with many requests from Souei in the future&mdash;but that was just another story.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera&rsquo;s report continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been taunting us, saying that we won&rsquo;t stand a chance against Velgrynd-sama and Kondou. They seem to want to be killed miserably.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She spoke plainly, but that was because she was too busy dealing with her own emotions. Carrera liked to stir things up, but she hated to be incited herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You never know who&rsquo;s able to win until you try it yourself.&rdquo; Testarossa spoke without expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, it was true that she had not won against Velgrynd. Nevertheless, Testarossa was not shying away from defeat, but was quite serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her crimson eyes told everyone eloquently that she would not lose the next time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, Carrera. I&rsquo;ve never understood why he called us insects. Is he really that strong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahaha, that&rsquo;s not possible, is it though? Even if it is, he&rsquo;s unforgivable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera denied Ultima&rsquo;s question with a laugh. Her eyes were not smiling at all. They were filled with a dangerous color and looked as if they were about to explode.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for mercy then, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. He&rsquo;s just a human being, you know that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima was furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera agreed while trying to hold back her rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What a pity. I wanted to teach him a lesson with my own hands. Tell Agera not to be lenient, and then we&rsquo;ll talk about pardon later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. He insulted us, so he should get what is deserved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no one on the scene to stop the girls from talking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima was cruel to the point of naivety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s cynical smile could strike fear into the hearts of any who saw it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Carrera was optimistically spreading destruction and emptiness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was not the slightest hint of compassion to be given.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never giving comfort to their enemies. For them, mercy was letting them die comfortably, and forgiveness was killing them as they suffered. Either way, it was still killing, but for them there was a difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Veyron listened to the conversation between the demonesses, he cursed the man who was Agera&rsquo;s enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His superiors, the devil lords, were not to be offended. Even so, they ranted and raved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron was holding his head inwardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Stupid human! The price for your stupidity will have to be taken on your own&hellip;at least I hope so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t help but hope so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron knew very well the horrors of Ultima. More than that, his fear of Carrera and Testarossa, the other adversaries, was indescribable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fate of the world could be changed depending on where their anger was directed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">At the very least, we must get rid of that fool as soon as possible and appease their anger. Please, Agera! You&rsquo;re our only hope!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a great demon, Veyron could only lament the fact that he could not do anything in this situation, and instead put his hope in Agera, a lower-level demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Regardless of the intentions of these demons, Benimaru gave the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Carrera, can you convey our words inside?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never tried it before, but I guess I could&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then tell him not to allow any more offensive remarks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera nodded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She forced herself into the channel with Esprit, wishing she had done so sooner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Esprit, can you hear me?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Geh, Carrera-sama?!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;You owe me one for what you just said. More than that&mdash;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, with a grudge in her heart, she gave the order.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Tell Agera to crush his soul.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera&rsquo;s voice echoed in Esprit&rsquo;s brain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;Benimaru-sama wants it, too. Know that failure is not an option!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Oh no, my power has been exposed to the executives,&rsquo; Esprit lamented. In addition, Carrera was still forcing her to intervene, but she was resigned to the fact that there was no choice in the matter. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time her boss had been unreasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit called out to Agera, thinking as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Hey Agera. Carrera-sama and the others are pretty angry. If we don&rsquo;t get rid of them soon, we&rsquo;re going to be in trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop wondering about how Carrera-sama knows what&rsquo;s going on here, but&mdash;I guess that&rsquo;s not the point. We need to prepare ourselves first. Since he&rsquo;s insulted even our Lord, I believe he deserves to be punished accordingly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tsk, you seem really mad too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit let out a sigh, noticing that the normally calm Agera was furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was impossible to stop him now. Or, rather, it was convenient that way. If Agera was going to get serious, then the only thing to do now was watch. However, Garcia shouted, unable to read the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You guys are weak as shit. Just give up and die! You can rest easy. Your masters are about to be dealt with anyway. So in the afterlife, you&rsquo;ll be able to serve them as you always have!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia&rsquo;s statement was also conveyed to Carrera through Esprit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this time, it wasn&rsquo;t just Carrera, but the whole group who heard it through the &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This bastard is full of shit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell is Agera doing? Didn&rsquo;t I say to kill him right away? Is he messing with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, hey, don&rsquo;t embarrass me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky that Shion&rsquo;s not here. If she were here, this whole operation would&rsquo;ve been ruined.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Hey, if it doesn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ll replace them, so decide quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so on, and so forth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, if Shion had been there, Agera&rsquo;s wishes would have been ignored. It wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered Esprit, but it would have hurt his pride as a demon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or rather, he felt that his reputation was being ruined at present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Wow, that sucks!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those were Esprit&rsquo;s true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although Garcia&rsquo;s crude behavior made him look like a small fry, his ability was real. He was a surprisingly troublesome opponent. However, in this case, there was no choice but to produce results. If they didn&rsquo;t defeat Garcia soon, they were sure to incur the wrath of the top brass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, Agera didn&rsquo;t seem to make a move, simply focusing on evasion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as he was not fatally wounded, Agera could not be defeated. But this was meaningless if he could not win. In that case, Esprit should have done something with magic, but this was not realistic. After she tried various things, it turned out that Garcia had a high resistance to magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?! All you can do is run away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia was getting carried away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even so, Agera showed no pretense of fighting back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Agera! We&rsquo;re in serious trouble. If we don&rsquo;t hurry up, Carrera-sama is going to get really mad!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the demons that followed her were afraid of their master&rsquo;s domineering authority when she was serious. If that anger were to be directed at them, they would be nothing but terrified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit, who was usually aloof, was now in a real panic. And yet, Agera still remained silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Zonda was preparing a cup of tea at a distance, as if he had nothing to do with it. He seemed to be planning to serve the executives when he got out of here, but from Esprit&rsquo;s point of view, this was simply nonsense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Zonda! What the hell are you doing while I&rsquo;m not looking?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just take a look and you will see. Agera-dono doesn&rsquo;t seem to be injured and is free.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid, asshole! Why am I the only one who needs to feel pressured?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit shouted as if wanting to bite him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zonda simply replied with a smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I&rsquo;m gonna kill him</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Esprit gritted her teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was a viscount class, yet he was not even afraid of Esprit, a count class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Well, after all, if you&rsquo;re going to serve Ultima-sama, you&rsquo;ll have to be thick-skinned like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thinking about it, Esprit had no choice but to stop dwelling on this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Zonda was useless, she would simply have to hope Agera does his best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no doubt that Agera was pissed off, so there must be a reason why he was not attacking. If he was trying to do something, she could only hope for it to come soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, Agera said something outrageous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Esprit, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems that, to my chagrin, it is impossible for me to defeat him with my own strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me&rsquo;, Esprit thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way she could tell her bosses that they couldn&rsquo;t win. Normally, Carrera was a mischievous person, but when she got mad, she was out of control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s more, she should be watching the battle right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was necessary to question Agera&rsquo;s intentions before the bosses became angry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing, it&rsquo;s quite simple. This man, wearing his warrior&rsquo;s armor, has increased not only his attack power but also his defense. He realized that no matter how many times I hit him with my sword, I would be unable to slay him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The effects of the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo;s ability to &lsquo;defeat and conquer&rsquo; combined with the defensive power of the Legendary-grade armor had led to Garcia&rsquo;s defense being raised to the equivalent of mythical-grade. Agera had seen through this and knew that his sword would not be able to penetrate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Could that be the reason my magic didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed. His movements are not a big deal, but I can&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera made a good point, and Esprit could only frown and nod. If they couldn&rsquo;t win, they would have no choice but to report it to Carrera, but that would only ruin their reputation&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without Agera&rsquo;s advice, Esprit had also observed Garcia and understood that she was inferior to him in strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, their own abilities were inferior to the ultimate power. A True Dragon would be able to defeat an Ultimate Skill with even a simple attack, but that was because they hosted the strongest willpower of any spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit was also a demon peer and was of a higher level spirit life form. However, their will power was not as strong as an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As long as they didn&rsquo;t do something about this reality, there would be no victory even if they surpassed the enemy in ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahahahaha! It seems that you have finally understood the difference in our abilities and have given up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was annoyed that his speak couldn&rsquo;t hit, but he was still okay with that. This was because Garcia&rsquo;s role was to stall the enemy here. If he waited until the enemy was exhausted, victory would be assured. Even if he didn&rsquo;t wait that long, his friends guarding the other gates would finish off the enemy and rush to his aid. That&rsquo;s why Garcia could enjoy the battle without any panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Garcia like this, Esprit clicked her tongue. And then, in a serious voice, she questioned Agera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You knew this was going to happen and you were still going to challenge Kondou, right? Don&rsquo;t you have some kind of plan to win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Agera smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I do. I need your help for my secret plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no option for Esprit to decline.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, this was all Agera&rsquo;s plan to get Esprit to say those words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The aloof Esprit had a hedonistic side to her. Even if Agera asked her in a normal way, she would never have said yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit was a she-devil who took pleasure in seeing her friends cry out in distress. Agera, who knew this well, decided to push Esprit until she felt in trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Although, if that had touched Carrera-sama&rsquo;s reverse scale, I might have been purged as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera was happy that he had won the bet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Esprit changed her mind, he told her his secret plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Turning the power of your will into a blade and striking down the enemy. That&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps, no matter what Agera did, Garcia would not understand. Even if he aimed at the gap in the armor, the blade would be blocked by the aura covering the entire body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The defensive power sublimated to mythical-grade was not limited to the appearance, and it completely protected the owner&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In terms of movement alone, Agera was lightly superior to Garcia. This was the reason why it was still difficult to make an effective strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If this was the case, then Agera had to reach the same level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Listening to the voice of the sword and becoming one with it. To achieve this goal&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With all his strength, Agera listened to the voice of the sword that he was born with. In doing so, he came to a conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm. We can&rsquo;t pierce his armor with our will alone, can we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trust me. Esprit, you may not be as talented as Carrera-sama, but you&rsquo;re still as skilled as a master. You may not like swords, but you have good sense. Therefore, I believe you are worthy of my trust.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? What are you talking about&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Put your hand on my back. And I&rsquo;ll take care of the rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unable to understand what Agera was saying, Esprit was confused. But still, she decided to trust Agera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera stood still. Esprit did as she was told and touched his back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if to ridicule the demons, Garcia shouted in a high-pitched voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve finally given up! All right, I&rsquo;ll make you comfortable now. It&rsquo;s about time your master, Demon Lord Rimuru, was killed by Velgrynd-sama. It&rsquo;s the end of the line for such a lowly monster, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be glad to have a guide on the road to Hades!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That comment was absolutely unforgivable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you despise our god, Rimuru-sama, as a lowly monster?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And to top it all off&hellip;you say that it&rsquo;s about time to be killed?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing these words through Esprit, the executives&rsquo; auras changed. But before that, Agera, and even Esprit, had already run out of patience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, guys. I give you credit for putting up with my insults, but if you&rsquo;re going to keep your reason here, then just stop being demons! I forgive you. Kill him now!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two of them had been planning to do so all along, not even needing to hear Carrera&rsquo;s orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Esprit, use my power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on but leave it to me. I&rsquo;m going to kill that son of a bitch!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a fit of rage, the two made their move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera had awakened to his powers by throwing his consciousness into the sword and speaking to it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;I will respond to your wish. Sharpen your mind and turn your body into a blade.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He thought he heard a beautiful voice, but its authenticity was unknown. But the power was certainly Agera&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am the blade, the indestructible blade that destroys my enemies!&rdquo; Agera shouted, and at the same time, a golden sword appeared in Esprit&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Blade Transformation&rsquo;&mdash;that was the power that Agera had acquired. The effect was simple and straightforward: Agera&rsquo;s body was transformed into a sword, and his skill-level was added to that of the holder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if the wielder had a high level of skill, the effect would be immeasurable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit drew her sword in a natural, fluid motion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blade, drawn from its golden scabbard, was also of a brilliant platinum, and its afterimage scattered eight petals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The name of the sword drawing technique was the highest technique of the &ldquo;Oboro Shinmei-ryu,&rdquo; Yaezakura&mdash;Hakkasen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead, you trash!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Wh-What&hellip;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia couldn&rsquo;t see it, couldn&rsquo;t understand it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What had just happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The defensive prey seemed to glow, and then disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He understood that it had turned into a sword, but there was no time to wonder why. He had no time to wonder why because he would have been killed before that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia was confident in his defenses because all attacks would be nullified before his ultimate power. It would take an ultimate power as powerful as Garcia&rsquo;s to defeat him. He couldn&rsquo;t sense such power from the demons he was dealing with. That&rsquo;s why he had felt at ease and took his time to hunt them down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, the situation had changed in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia&rsquo;s armor was torn as thin as paper, and his body was shredded into tiny pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right, he was sliced up eight times in an instant, and his life was cut short without even allowing him time to think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;No, there was still time to think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Esprit&rsquo;s hand was a small red ball, an embodied soul.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, so this guy&rsquo;s is red, huh? Quite a typical color, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think he just doesn&rsquo;t know what he amounts to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit muttered, to which Agera, now in human form, replied. Then, glaring viciously at the red ball, he spat out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No warrior can remain silent when his lord is insulted, you fool! But alas! It was my task to admonish you, but I didn&rsquo;t expect the words of a such little man to have set me into a rage&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit gave Agera a rare word of comfort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, well. This time it was an insult to Rimuru-sama, so it couldn&rsquo;t be helped. Carrera-sama has said she forgives you, so maybe you&rsquo;re worrying too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then let&rsquo;s just leave it at that, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While responding, Agera vowed to be more diligent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit looked at Agera with some envy.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just now, clearly&mdash;Agera had acquired a new Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then he remembered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He remembered his old self, the one who had trained to become a master of the sword. Not all of his memories had returned, but only the sword skills he mastered had reappeared in his body. Or perhaps he should say that they had been completely recreated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;Oboro Shinmei-ryu,&rdquo; the supreme sword technique for dispelling demons, had been recreated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he was a human, Agera believed that his soul had resided in his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was that why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he turned himself into a sword, his memories came back to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He realized for the first time the meaning of why he had taken the form of a samurai.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before he was reborn as a demon in this world, he was a samurai.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Byakuya Araki was my name, wasn&rsquo;t it? Hm, even if a dead man wandered out now, it would only confuse everyone&hellip;Hakurou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The image of Hakurou flashed through his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His disciples had grown up successfully and had inherited a new school called &ldquo;Oboro-ryu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera himself had changed the name to &ldquo;Oboro-ryu,&rdquo; as he felt that &ldquo;Shinmei&rdquo; was not appropriate for a monster</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c1">. That memory came to mind, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Kukuku, getting &ldquo;named&rdquo; by Rimuru-sama, isn&rsquo;t that even the heart&rsquo;s fate understood? If that&rsquo;s the case, there will be no curtain for me to appear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this world, he had become a family with the Ogre tribe and had a daughter, and Hakurou was the child his daughter bore when she grew up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this age, there were many people whom Hakurou had cultivated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most prominent of these was Agera&rsquo;s lord, Rimuru, and all of the achievements in raising Rimuru could be attributed to Hakurou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera was honestly happy to know that the skills he had trained and refined would be passed on&mdash;It would be churlish to interfere now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera thought about this and switched his mindset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had lost interested in the garbage that had just been killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera turned on his heel and headed for Carrera, his current master.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

This was Zonda&rsquo;s work, and it was also well received.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Putting off the discussion for a later time, Esprit handed the red orb to Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is the soul of that rude man. The core of his heart has been locked away, so his ego is still intact!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nice, Esprit! Now we can punish this fool for insulting Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes. By the way, Carrera, can you leave that to me?&rdquo; Ultima interrupted, and Carrera tossed her the red orb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s okay with you, Benimaru-san, it&rsquo;s fine with me.&rdquo; She waited for Benimaru&rsquo;s decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do what you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no need to ask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru had no taste for torturing the dead, and since he had no control over the soul, he had no choice but to leave the matter to the demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, it would be a violation of principle to deal with an opponent who has already won or lost. But this time, Garcia&rsquo;s comment was unacceptable. Benimaru couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to stop them, and so, the red orb fell into Ultima&rsquo;s hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go! Grudge Curse Destruction!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a deadly poison refined by Ultima. It was not a physical substance, but rather a dangerous one that destroyed the spiritual body and even invaded the astral body as well. There was no way that the red orb, the embodiment of the soul, could withstand it, and Garcia screamed out in pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsaquo;S-stop it, stop it&mdash;Gehhh!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Ultima only laughed happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, yes. The effect is outstanding!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By the way, what kind of effect does it have?&rdquo; Testarossa asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t that she didn&rsquo;t know, but that she wanted to let Garcia hear it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it keeps you suffering until the power of the soul wears away. This guy has a lot of energy, so I think he&rsquo;ll enjoy it for a long time. It&rsquo;ll probably take a thousand years, but then you&rsquo;ll be reborn as a pure white and beautiful soul!&rdquo; Ultima replied happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Garcia sobbed inaudibly. He wondered where he had made the wrong choice, and deeply regretted it now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s very kind of you. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be grateful for the opportunity to atone for his sins.&rdquo; Testarossa said with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s impossible&rsquo;&mdash;Benimaru thought, but for once he didn&rsquo;t offer any help, he just let it be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zonda served them, and they took a short break.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit, wondering how they could afford to do so, opened her mouth in an attempt to keep things interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To be honest, when Agera said he couldn&rsquo;t win, I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that the mood was peaceful, Esprit felt like complaining lightly. She knew that Agera would have a plan, but he had taken advantage of her confusion, and that&rsquo;s why she was still upset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that I couldn&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agera replied back, but in reality, he hadn&rsquo;t been entirely sure about his plan. He was glad that he had succeeded, but if the &lsquo;Blade Transformation&rsquo; had failed, he would have been blindsided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you should have at least consulted me beforehand! It&rsquo;s okay because we won, but I wouldn&rsquo;t take responsibility for if we lost!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been a long time since she had been as desperate as she was this time, even though Esprit was usually hiding in a safe zone. This made her even more irritated with Agera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima nodded in response, laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose, even by any chance. Or rather, I wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. Rimuru-sama wouldn&rsquo;t be mad if we lost, but we can&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s what I thought, too, which is why I&rsquo;ve been monitoring you through Esprit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera seemed to be a laissez-faire type of person, but if Agera and the others were about to lose, she would have been the first to move in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From that point of view, what would follow would have been a serious attack by the executives. Although that might be considered a shameful thing to do, they needed to be prepared for any eventuality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit, perhaps feeling uneasy after the discussion, asked in a whisper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, is Shion-sama going to be okay? The battle is over for us, but she hasn&rsquo;t come out yet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit, who had thought that Shion would be fine, suddenly became worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru replied with a nonchalant look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No problem. She might be the kind of person who would forget her objective, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be struggling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s overzealous. The same attacks over and over again won&rsquo;t work, so she should consider different ways to attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Esprit wondered at that statement, as if he could see it in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Are you aware of what&rsquo;s going on inside?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Testarossa who spoke up in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? I&rsquo;m staying because I have to be ready in case something happens to the officers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Carrera and Ultima spewed out their tea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait a minute, Testarossa. What is it then? Did you know what was going on in there without Esprit&rsquo;s information?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Testarossa&rsquo;s smile deepened as she smiled at them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Carrera shouted as if she had just realized something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then are you also watching Rimuru-sama fight too?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultima jumped up, as if the possibility had just occurred to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair, Testarossa!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously, you shouldn&rsquo;t do that! It&rsquo;s just like Diablo. Why do you always think that all that matters is what&rsquo;s good for you? Don&rsquo;t you think you should invite us as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carrera and Ultima were upset, but Testarossa kept a cool face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So did Benimaru and Souei. As the people in charge of gathering information, they thought that this was a battle they could not miss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion, by the way, was unaware of this. That&rsquo;s why she had been the first to jump into the gate. If Shion had been watching Rimuru&rsquo;s fight, she would not have moved until it was over. Benimaru knew this, which was why he had kept it a secret from Shion. In any case, it was necessary to pacify the disgruntled Carrera and the others. Benimaru had no choice but to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As mentioned, the monitoring by Moss is very convenient&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had him enter all eight gates to do individual surveillance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;It worked without a hitch&rsquo;, Benimaru concluded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This meant that Moss was still gathering information even now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru had strictly ordered him not to move without doing something, so that the enemy inside would not detect him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I tried it myself, but I couldn&rsquo;t touch the other gates. It seems that Agera is the one who killed the enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t get in either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aside from Zonda, who had done nothing, Esprit had also lost the right to try again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was unclear what Velgrynd was thinking, but it was confirmed that once you entered, you would not be able to enter any other gates unless you directly defeated the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be expected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. It was a good decision to let them enter from the beginning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, Souei and Testarossa all nodded to one another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, if any of us have a hard time, Testarossa will come to our aid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Actually, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen, and I&rsquo;ve got other things on my mind, but I&rsquo;ll be there if you need me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No need&mdash;is what I&rsquo;d like to say, but it&rsquo;s Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s orders. I&rsquo;m going to try to win, so don&rsquo;t be too hasty.&rdquo; Carrera said, smiling wryly, and Benimaru and the others nodded, as if they felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Benimaru changed his expression and spoke to Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Carrera, about your opponent, don&rsquo;t let your guard down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, but why say that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kondou, I believe, was the only one who noticed Moss and took him out with a single bullet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;That&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo; Smiling wryly, Carrera seemed more interested than afraid of her opponent&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried about you, but if something happens, you can call for help through Esprit.&rdquo; Testarossa said, and Carrera responded by raising one hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her demeanor eloquently told her that it was not necessary. Typical Carrera, Testarossa smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, the officers resumed their assault on the gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion was fighting in one of them, so there were only six left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Excluding the gate guarded by Velgrynd, five gates were now opened at once.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Her opponent was Minaza, the sixth-ranked knight of the Single Digits, one of the four head knights and also a female knight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion breathed heavily with her shoulders and gave Minaza an indignant glare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you praise for giving me so much trouble!&rdquo; She shouted loudly, her voice full of spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza, for her part, was not unharmed. Her uniform was torn and her bare skin was exposed. But there was nothing sexy about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And rightfully so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza had stopped her Mimicry long ago and was giving it her all in her true form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up! I&rsquo;m the one who should be giving the praise. All for your futile efforts! I praise you for defeating my children, but I&rsquo;ll have to repay that grudge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Minaza&rsquo;s feet, there were a great many dead insectoids. All of them had been slaughtered by Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, the insect-type higher form, an insectar, was the true identity of Minaza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmph! A small fish like that doesn&rsquo;t count as a thing to me. I&rsquo;m used to the training grounds, where many more powerful individuals spring up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, it&rsquo;s a shame. I am an experienced woman, despite my appearance. This is not the first time I&rsquo;ve fought an insect-type beast!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although exhausted, Shion still had plenty of energy left. The smug Shion looked down on Minaza and told her as such. Then, as if remembering, she continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of which&hellip; Now that I think about it, Razul was not an insectoid, but rather a bug-shaped majin (insectar). He said it was in its full form, so I&rsquo;m sure it was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Minaza&rsquo;s face changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Razul? You&rsquo;re the one who defeated the guardian god of the West?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion nodded her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take him on alone, but I was the one who defeated him. He was a strong opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing this, Minaza muttered to herself, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Then she turned her face down and started laughing with a &lsquo;kukuku.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, you got rid of him! He betrayed us. We are an Aggressor race from the otherworld, but His Majesty Rudra accepted us and we finally found a safe place to live. And yet, he continued to be an unmitigated and selfish fool, not showing any reverence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it was explained like that, it didn&rsquo;t make sense to Shion. She just looked at Minaza with an expression that seemed to say, &lsquo;What the hell is she talking about?&rsquo; However, there was one thing that bothered her, so she decided to take the opportunity to ask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me ask you something, aside from Razul, did you send any of your people to other places?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion was curious about her friends Zegion and Apito. If they knew each other, it might not be a good idea to kill Minaza. Thinking so, she asked just in case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There are many races in the otherworld. Through the Underworld Gate that sometimes opens, various Aggressors target this world. There are us insectars and cryptids of similar nature. And then there are the phantoms. Unlike demons, we are semi-spiritual, so we can materialize on this world if we take our time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion didn&rsquo;t care if she didn&rsquo;t get an answer, but Minaza was kind enough to tell her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Minaza meant by &ldquo;Underworld Gate&rdquo; was the &ldquo;Gate of Hell&rdquo;, a term familiar to Diablo and her friends, but Shion just thought it was hot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza said that the Underworld was a place where the three major races fought for supremacy. There was also a parallel world, which was a hell where the demons reigned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The world was very poor, and there was nothing to feed on. That&rsquo;s why it was said that they were vigilantly targeting this world. It was said that they had been sending their people to this world many times since long ago in order to expand their territory. Insectoids such as the Army Wasps were also a kind of Aggressor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, some of them are unfaithful to us, and we sometimes get into a bit of trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Razul, whom Shion and the others had defeated, was a representative of such a race. It was proof that them and Minaza were not monolithic, although Shion remembered something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apito and Zegion had been picked up by Rimuru after escaping from someone, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">There is no doubt that they are enemies!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she had no particular reason to believe it, Shion decided as such. She trusted her intuition, and she was proud of the fact that she had never been wrong in such a situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, too, Shion&rsquo;s intuition was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not a coincidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion was deeply connected to Rimuru&mdash;by Ciel and his Skill&mdash;because she had once died and come back to life. Therefore, her computing power interfered, and she was able to correctly discern the truth from the fragmented information she had already obtained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In short, you are the enemy, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, what are you saying now? Thanks to your stalling, I will be able to revive my beautiful children once again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she shouted this, Minaza&rsquo;s lower body swelled up. Though hidden by the skirt of her uniform, Minaza&rsquo;s lower body was also covered with several mouths. And from each of those mouths, all at once, a wicked egg was being produced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha! You may look strong, but you&rsquo;re exhausted from fighting my children. You think you can win against this many&mdash;Waah?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza&rsquo;s triumphant words came to a halt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A single flash of Shion&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hercules Ex&rdquo; was enough to knock out a large number of the insect beasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not possible! My children&hellip; With the help of His Majesty Rudra, they should have been reborn as warriors with overwhelming power&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza&rsquo;s power was a power similar to Apito&rsquo;s &lsquo;Queen Worship&rsquo;. It was called the Unique Skill &lsquo;Gluttony Rebirth&rsquo;, and by eating the corpses of the children she had given birth to, she could regenerate them over and over again. In addition, the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; loaned by Rudra had reinforced the system and greatly reduced the time required for rebirth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The numerous insect-type majins that were produced were as strong an opponent to Shion as Minaza was proud of. Each of them was as good as a greater majin, and some of them were as fierce as a Demon Lord Seed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion had defeated all of them, though it was a hard fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That being the case, there would be no second time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Using &lsquo;Optimal Action&rsquo;, the essence of the Unique Skill &lsquo;Cook&rsquo;, the insect-type majins were defeated in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza was astonished. Even if she didn&rsquo;t fight herself, she could exhaust her opponents just wearing them down with the children over and over again. She was so good at such tactics that she was confused in the face of a non-standard opponent like Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she was still a queen. She did not repeat her mistake and stood up in a rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forgive you. My children, lend your strength to the Queen Mother!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Interesting, I&rsquo;ll accept your challenge!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza, with the children&rsquo;s power at her disposal, shifted into battle form. Shion happily intercepted her with her Hercules Ex.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, the long battle began.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a back-and-forth battle of offense and defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza&rsquo;s attacks wounded Shion, but she was instantly healed by the activation of Ultraspeed Regeneration. And Shion&rsquo;s attacks were unable to damage Minaza&rsquo;s exoskeleton. Equipped with legendary-grade armor and protected by Ultimate Enchantment, Minaza was now so strong that even mythical-grade weapons would have difficulty damaging it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minaza&rsquo;s speed was greater than Shion&rsquo;s, but Shion&rsquo;s strength was greater. Minaza had the advantage in defense, while Shion had the advantage in resilience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it, not this again. Those bugs are hard, and really nasty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion wanted to break Minaza&rsquo;s exoskeleton, no matter how small the wound. Then the rest could be cooked by &lsquo;Cook&rsquo;. Minaza was desperate not to let that happen. She was not underestimating Shion, but to be honest, she felt threatened by her strength, which far exceeded her expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I can&rsquo;t believe it. I can&rsquo;t believe that she can fight me in this form so evenly&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The amount of magicules was enormous as it appeared, but if that was the only reason, there was no way she should have struggled. What made Shion troublesome was that while she appeared to be sloppy, she was actually quite skilled with a sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was not as good as Benimaru, but she had still been recognized by Hakurou, her master. In other words, she was a licensed swordsman. This, combined with Shion&rsquo;s strength, made Minaza&rsquo;s rampage a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion, however, was not satisfied. She wanted to defeat Minaza quickly and move on, but she was stronger than she had thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">As expected of a warrior at the top of the Empire. As Rimuru-sama had said, she was an opponent I couldn&rsquo;t let my guard down against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t think about that until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion usually didn&rsquo;t think too much. Now that she had, she began to think about a possible clue to defeating her opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was just a temporary thing, but it was better that she realized that she needed to use her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it was not as if a good idea would come to you just by using your brain. Though uninspired, Shion had Ciel&rsquo;s blessing.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;You have the power. It took a while to choose the best race out of all the possibilities, but now it has been decided. The one that is most suitable for you&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing that voice, Shion remembered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had asked her some questions when he gave her the reward, but Shion had not thought deeply about it. She remembered saying that she would leave everything to him, but nothing had changed since then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion did not care about the evolution of the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru had evolved from an oni to a &ldquo;flame spirit oni&rdquo;, which meant that he became as powerful as a divine oni.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion, on the other hand, was still an oni.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she didn&rsquo;t mind, because she was strong enough as she was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was not enough to defeat Minaza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was inevitable that Shion would seek power, and in response to her desire, the Soul Corridor was connected.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;&mdash;A &ldquo;Battle spirit oni&rdquo; is a good choice. It is a high-ranking holy spirit and boasts unparalleled strength in material terms. Next is the verification of Skills&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you</span><span class="c1">&mdash;Shion decided, tossing the matter aside. Then she concentrated on Minaza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s demeanor was brusque, but for some reason, she seemed to hear a hint of happiness in the voice. It may have been Shion&rsquo;s imagination, but there was a real change that occurred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What the hell is wrong with you?! That gushing, intense youki&hellip; Have you been slacking off until now&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The spirit surpasses the body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, Shion&rsquo;s racial awakening was accelerated as the voice of her heart demanded. The evolutionary possibilities were managed by Ciel, and the best ones were selected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion evolved into a rare but powerful divine spirit, a &ldquo;battle spirit oni&rdquo;. Her body had &lsquo;Infinite Regeneration&rsquo; and she was immortal as long as her magicules existed. Attacks launched from her body were not limited to physical damage, but also destroyed the mind. Despite the fact that she was a spiritual life form with no weaknesses, she had an advantage against all attributes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion had evolved into an existence that could be called a natural enemy of spiritual life forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s evolution had also changed her physical form. Her body was optimized to be more specialized for combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She realized this halfway, by instinct. As if she had stretched out under a clear blue sky, she felt refreshed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion held her favorite sword, the new Hercules Ex, in her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did I keep you waiting? But now my time with you is over.&rdquo; In a polite tone, Shion spoke to Minaza.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me! Just as you have hidden your power, I will reveal my true form!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">True to her words, Minaza&rsquo;s form had become even more deformed. She even cut down her own lifespan, and became even more aggressive as she tried to fight Shion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so the battle began&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those who seek to take our safe haven shall die in pain! Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; unleash your full power&hellip; Come forth, emergents! I will feed on my own flesh and use my instincts to destroy my enemies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Chaotic Fate!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&mdash;It was over in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The evil and forbidden final attack that Minaza was about to make was crushed by Shion&rsquo;s sword before it could be seen in full.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In front of the shattered pieces of flesh, Shion declared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so annoying and talking too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Wha&hellip;What the hell is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the pieces of flesh lying around was Minaza&rsquo;s head, more than half of which was missing. Minaza realized that her inevitable death was imminent, but she couldn&rsquo;t accept the reality and was gravely upset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking down coldly at Minaza, Shion asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you need some help finishing you off</span><sup class="c1 c18"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c1">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Minaza, Shion was the worst possible match.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she had evolved into a &ldquo;battle spirit oni&rdquo;, she was just an even match with or without an Ultimate Skill. From this point on, there was no way Minaza could win when she was only evenly matched against Shion, who had no Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a result of Shion&rsquo;s evolution, the power of her will had reached the ultimate realm. Shion&rsquo;s favorite sword had also evolved to a mythical-grade that could be called &ldquo;Hercules Deluxe&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Minaza&rsquo;s power had not been borrowed, it would have been a different story, but she was not strong enough to deal with Shion now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guh, hah&hellip; That&rsquo;s ridiculous&hellip; You&rsquo;re too strong. B-but, my children will &hellip;&rdquo; Minaza said as if blind. But her hopes had already been dashed. Shion&rsquo;s Chaotic Fate had sliced and diced all living things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If only it were that way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shion&rsquo;s words were a mercy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;You&rsquo;re so naive. So naive&hellip; You can&rsquo;t win against the Insect Lord-sama that way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s when Minaza&rsquo;s energy ran out. Her life was gone and Shion&rsquo;s victory was assured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Insect lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words Minaza had left behind held a very important meaning. But Shion didn&rsquo;t care about any of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s none of my business!&rdquo; she said with a refreshing detachment, and did not even try to remember it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, Minaza, an invader from the otherworld, met a pitiful end along with her children.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The queen, who had sought to establish an insectar paradise under the protection of Emperor Rudra, disappeared from the world just before achieving her ambition.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

He was a duke-class, undefeated for over 4,000 years. Despite this, he was unable to stand up to the warrior-like figure of Marco in front of him and was humiliated to be lying on the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco had correctly used the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; by imitating Kondou&rsquo;s form with the Unique Skill &lsquo;Impersonator&rsquo;. By imitating Kondou with the Unique Skill &lsquo;Impersonator&rsquo;, Marco was able to use the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; correctly. He had Kondou&rsquo;s Skills at his disposal, and he was efficient without the slightest bit of waste.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron was a powerful opponent, but Marco was still better than him. It was only because of Veyron&rsquo;s high level of skill that he was able to do more than bend the knee. His combat skills, honed as a demon, were no match for Marco. It was a frightening reality, but Veyron had no fear. On the contrary, inwardly, he even enjoyed the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was only natural. Having said that he could win in front of Ultima, his master, and all the other leaders, he had to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Devil, was your name Veyron? I congratulate you on your fight, but it&rsquo;s useless no matter how many times you try. I&rsquo;ve seen what you can do. I am more than capable of handling you now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose. Since I haven&rsquo;t shown my true colors yet, your assessment is quite correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco was about to recommend surrender, but Veyron&rsquo;s reaction made him look doubtful. In Marco&rsquo;s opinion, there was an enormous difference in strength between him and Veyron. It was proof that Kondou&rsquo;s strength was overwhelming, but to Marco, it was his own strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why he was angry at Veyron&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron was a demon peer, but his magicules were less than a quarter of Marco&rsquo;s. It was difficult earlier because it wasn&rsquo;t one-on-one, but now it was just Veyron. Marco had a huge advantage because he was unencumbered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, Veyron merely stood up and laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You cannot defeat me by imitating others. Because I am also good at imitation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A forgery is not as good as a true work. Do you understand that this is the truth? No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you trying to say?&rdquo; Marco asked in frustration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron laughed inwardly, wishing he could just slash him instead of asking questions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you now. What I consider to be the best work of art is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as he shouted this, Veyron activated his newfound ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron is Ultima&rsquo;s butler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a long time, he was in charge of all her affairs. He had to deal with whatever his lord asked of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The specialized field of cooking was left to Zonda, but the other things were under Veyron&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Veyron had devised was a Unique Skill called &lsquo;Impersonator&rsquo;, a useful power to be able to become anything. With this &lsquo;Impersonator&rsquo;, it was possible to turn into anyone that Veyron saw. It was a skill similar to Marco&rsquo;s Impersonator, but Impersonator&rsquo;s accuracy was better. However, Marco was enhanced by Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s power. Considering this, Veyron had no chance to win, but that was not necessary to be said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the person Veyron was trying to emulate was stronger than Kondou, whom Marco had imitated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco was able to reproduce less than 80 percent of Kondou&rsquo;s strength. Veyron, who had a similar ability, knew that it was impossible to reproduce someone who was too powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is why Veyron chose a supernatural being who had charmed even his master. By copying the Demon Lord Rimuru, he hoped to utilize some of his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, Veyron heard a voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;That cannot be allowed. But in return, I will grant you the power.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was not the same as the &ldquo;Voice of the World&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first Veyron was puzzled, but as soon as he understood the implications, he was almost moved to tears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I, even as I am, am being watched over by that love!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if praying to God, Veyron gave his thanks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron realized that his Skill had evolved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if it was an imitation, it became art as long as it moved people. As if to prove this, there was a certain power in that ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Artist&rsquo;&mdash;It was because of this that Veyron was convinced that he could beat Marco.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What appeared before Marco was a young warrior with a keen eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Who? No, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who it is. I don&rsquo;t know any swordsman better than Lieutenant Kondou. You are free to imitate whomever you like, but you still won&rsquo;t stand a chance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young warrior that Veyron imitated looked very much like Agera, which was no surprise, for it was the appearance of Byakuya Araki in his younger days. This result was the ultimate culmination of imitation that Veyron had achieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron thought to himself. A true forger would be able to copy a painting from the heyday of the artist they were trying to imitate. It was only Veyron, who had tried to master all fields of art at the behest of Ultima, who had come to this conclusion. &lsquo;Artist&rsquo; could recreate the power of the copy in their prime, even if he had never actually met the person. It was a foul power indeed. And it was here that Veyron unleashed his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His master, Ultima, had evolved by receiving power from Rimuru. By his grace, Veyron had also grown in power. The amount of magicules Veyron now had was comparable to that of a demon lord or even an awakened demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-What?! It&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s a different person from before!!&rdquo; Marco was astonished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron ignored Marco and materialized a sword in his hand. It was the demon&rsquo;s unique &lsquo;Matter Creation&rsquo; ability. Although it was only a fake imitation of Agera&rsquo;s Blade Transformation sword, it had the effect of the Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Artist&rsquo; added to it. It was a fake, and there was no doubt that its performance was as close to the real thing as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron took a glance at Marco and spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Certainly, this Kondou fellow is not to be underestimated. However&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Just what are you trying to say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that Carrera-sama has gone to battle, I fear his fate may soon be sealed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahaha, what nonsense!&rdquo; Marco laughed at this nonsense. Marco couldn&rsquo;t imagine Kondou being defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two men glared at each other. As long as their arguments were incompatible, there was no choice but to settle the matter by force. They both moved at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Baika (Plum Blossom)&mdash;Gokatotsu!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;True Fake Transcendental Technique (Gallery Fake)&rsquo;&mdash;Yaezakura&mdash;Hakkasen&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The imitation was now the real thing. Veyron&rsquo;s eight sword flashes knocked away the five sword strands. The remaining three sword blasts cut off Marco&rsquo;s arms. Finally, Veyron stopped with a snap of his blade against Marco&rsquo;s neck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-Ahh, aah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The intense pain from both arms caused Marco&rsquo;s transformation to unravel. He tried to stop the blood from flowing, but Marco had no more than elbows to speak of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fufufu, I&rsquo;m not going to kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuu, are you trying to take me hostage?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, how can that be?&rdquo; At this point, Veyron also changed his mind and smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am Lady Ultima&rsquo;s butler, so I will do whatever it takes to please her.&rdquo; Marco felt a deep sense of dread as Veyron gave him an unanswerable answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing to me?&rdquo; Marco couldn&rsquo;t help but ask that question, but his reaction was already as if he had fallen into Veyron&rsquo;s trap. Veyron replied promptly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Her Ladyship is a very cruel person. The painful emotions of those who oppose her are her favorite. She doesn&rsquo;t kill her enemies right away, rather she rots them little by little. I am in a position to admonish her for that. And yet&hellip;and yet!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear this&rsquo;&mdash;Marco thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Veyron was ruthless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I love it. I, too, find nothing more pleasurable than to see a strong man begging for mercy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why Marco is the best toy of all&rsquo;, Veyron&rsquo;s muffled voice told him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, please stop. I surrender. If you want, I swear I&rsquo;ll never disobey you again. So&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marco began to plead, but no one could blame him for that. He hadn&rsquo;t known defeat before, so he was vulnerable when on the defensive. Besides, Marco&rsquo;s skills were solid, but his spirit had not been trained. His ultimate power had only been lent to him, and he had not mastered it himself. Veyron, a demon among demons, was skilled in the art of tapping into the fear of such an opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm, too bad! No need to worry about it, I decline.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because the Empire&rsquo;s policy is the same, isn&rsquo;t it? I am a supporter of that idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Once you start a war, you cannot surrender. It&rsquo;s wonderful! The weak should just submit from the start. It&rsquo;s too embarrassing to ask for negotiation after losing a war. It&rsquo;s a way of thinking that I can&rsquo;t help but sympathize with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Th-That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it so? You&rsquo;ve done this before, so you can&rsquo;t be so selfish as to not want to do it when it&rsquo;s your turn. So&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At this point, Veyron&rsquo;s mouth twisted into an ear-splitting grin. His smile was even more disturbing because he was dressed like a gentleman butler, and it left a mark on the viewer&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take responsibility, kid. And help please Lady Ultima.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Veyron revealed his true nature. A cruel, brutal, merciless demon, befitting of Ultima&rsquo;s first dependent. That was Veyron.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-Help me&hellip;Help me, Lieutenant Kondou!&rdquo; Marco&rsquo;s cries for help did not reach Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that cry is quite pleasant, but it may disturb others. So, please be quiet for a while.&rdquo; As soon as he said that, Veyron carelessly pulled out Marco&rsquo;s tongue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guuhooo?! Woooo-woooooh!!&rdquo; Marco&rsquo;s voiceless voice echoed in the other world, separated from this world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As for Marco&rsquo;s fate after this&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

He had been secretly watching Rimuru&rsquo;s battle, and now Rimuru had secured a great victory. It was fortuitous that he was able to watch the battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rimuru had taken on both Veldora and Velgrynd at the same time, and still seemed to have the upper hand. He even ate Veldora and evolved. On top of that, he overwhelmed Velgrynd, undaunted by the onslaught that Souei would have been unable to resist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How strong such a Rimuru had become could not be determined by appearance alone. Even when he tried to find out through the Soul Corridor, Souei could not sense it. Therefore, it was not just Souei&rsquo;s desire to know about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least, Diablo had taken little action until the end and was undoubtedly staying by Rimuru&rsquo;s side. Although he was an annoying bastard for running away, Souei could not complain openly because he understood Diablo&rsquo;s point and purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Speaking of annoying, there was also Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she had quietly declared her intention to stay, Souei had mixed feelings when he considered the implications. Still, Souei did not oppose her, because he understood her intentions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps Velgrynd, realizing the disadvantage, had started to protect Rudra in the middle of the battle with Rimuru. There was no guarantee that she would not come out until she had defeated the other seven gates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">There is no way that the cunning Testarossa did not foresee the possibility of this happening, and yet she didn&rsquo;t point it out, which means that she thinks she can handle it by herself. I don&rsquo;t think she can win against Velgrynd-sama, but she has a remarkable amount of confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei had seen right through Testarossa&rsquo;s intentions. Testarossa was probably aiming for a rematch with Velgrynd. Souei hoped that he could be forgiven for being jealous of Testarossa, since she was trying to challenge an opponent that Souei could not beat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei thought to himself. Benimaru, too, must have read Testarossa&rsquo;s thoughts and approved of them. This was because even Benimaru was no match for Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Benimaru, who was good at using flames, would not be able to attack Velgrynd, who could be called the god of flames. There was a possibility that he could not even buy time, and Testarossa was thought to be more suitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incidentally, Souei would only be able to withstand Velgrynd for a few seconds. None of Souei&rsquo;s specialties would work against Velgrynd, who could control space. He would not even be allowed to escape and would end up being burned to a crisp. Being aware of this was not very fun for Souei because had to accept what would happen. Although it was not fun, he had no choice but to endorse Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, Souei decided to devote himself to his work in a very complicated state of mind, feeling both happy about Rimuru&rsquo;s victory and dissatisfied with his own lack of strength. Rimuru&rsquo;s order to kill the enemy was absolute, and he had no hesitation in obeying it. For Souei, eliminating the enemy was a natural thing to do in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Let&rsquo;s finish this quickly and get back to Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his loyalty to Rimuru growing even stronger, Souei went through the gate as his excited heart commanded.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He caught a glimpse of the enemy, and Souei did not hesitate to go straight for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gate resembled a circular colosseum, which was the same inside all the gates. In the center of the colosseum stood his target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, are you my opponent?&rdquo; The smirking man was Gardner, the fourth rank in the Single Digit hierarchy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve come all this way, I&rsquo;ll at least introduce myself. My name is Gardner. I&rsquo;m in charge of his Majesty Rudra&rsquo;s protection. It&rsquo;ll be a short visit, but I hope you enjoy it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Gardner looked at Souei as if he was trying to figure out what to do with him. Gardner looked at Souei as if he were judging him. He was tingling with a secret hobby of abuse, wondering how he could torment him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response, Souei was silent. No, rather, after a short pause, he let out a sigh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did my precious time get taken away just to deal with someone like you?&rdquo; He spat this out in a vexed tone, but Gardner was not one to let that go unheard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My name is Souei. If you wish to surrender, I&rsquo;ll accept, but you don&rsquo;t want to, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Gardner was incensed by Souei&rsquo;s attitude and had fallen for Souei&rsquo;s schemes even before the fight began, though he was unaware of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Souei, was it? According to what Kondou-san found out, you were working as an intelligence officer in the land of monsters, right? That means you&rsquo;re not suited for direct combat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Kondou&rsquo;s investigation was not so lukewarm. Gardner knew that Souei&rsquo;s strength was of a certain level and that he was daring to provoke him. He originally thought that he could win without such a challenge, but he thought it would be rewarding if he lost his cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a shallow strategy, and it was meaningless when provoked by Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You lowlife. Enough of your nonsense, let&rsquo;s get started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei had seen through Gardner&rsquo;s strength in this short time. Without realizing it, Gardner recklessly slashed at Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gardner&rsquo;s weapon was a two-handed Blue Dragon Blade (Seiryuuto). The blade, thicker and larger than a knife, was difficult to handle but powerful. The flowing succession of attacks was magnificent, as if he were dancing. It was an attack that combined strength and sharpness with Gardner&rsquo;s high skill. However, it would not work against Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gardner&rsquo;s Seiryuuto sliced through the air, and the momentum was too much for him to keep his stance. Souei didn&rsquo;t miss, and the bullet that came from the shadow at Gardner&rsquo;s feet was sucked into the chest of his prey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Guha?!&rdquo; Gardner coughed up blood and collapsed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei emerged from the shadows to finish him off. In his hand was a Walther P99, a small handgun. Souei had secretly obtained the prototype that Rimuru had Kaijin build for him. He had been practicing to be able to shoot it from the shadow space, and the result was Gardner, who had been shot through the heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh, how boring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how strong the opponent is, if they were caught off guard, they could be killed with a single blow&mdash;Souei believed in this kind of claim, but he also understood that there were some opponents for whom such a method would not work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gardner, however, was not one of them, and his plan had worked brilliantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, this bullet contained all of Souei&rsquo;s Skills. In addition to the &lsquo;Ultraspeed&rsquo; and &lsquo;Insta-kill&rsquo; of the Unique Skill &lsquo;Shadow Striker&rsquo;, it also had the effects of poison, paralysis, and corrosion. The initial speed of the bullet reached tens of times the speed of sound thanks to Ultraspeed, and with Insta-kill added to its power, it could destroy even spiritual bodies. With the addition of various abnormalities, Gardner&rsquo;s death was certain. Everyone, not just Souei, would have judged it as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Idiot, you let your guard down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a voice came from behind Souei as he began to walk towards the gate. Before he could do so, Souei&rsquo;s head was cut off and the Seiryuuto sprouted from his chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, this kind of thing is troublesome. It&rsquo;s good for killing these clever bastards, but it&rsquo;s not very interesting because the game is decided in an instant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needless to say, the voice belonged to Gardner, who was supposed to be dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The body was still lying there, but Gardner was still standing. The reason for this was a special ability Gardner had acquired. Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo;, &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; was the power that Gardner had been lent by Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike Velgrynd, who had an enormous amount of magicules, Gardner was a Saint level of ordinary. Although he was comparable to an awakened demon lord, he was not capable of creating multiple &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo;. He could only create one, but it was enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how cunning the opponent was, as long as it was the main body, they would not be able to see that it was a fake. Gardner&rsquo;s plan was to lure others into a false sense of security by using one of them as a decoy and attacking with the main body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a strategy for victory, but Gardner was not satisfied with it. This is because Gardner enjoyed tormenting people who begged for their lives. With this method, he killed his enemies before they even had a chance to beg for their lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, are you alive? I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite his complaint, Gardner had not forgotten his role. He had to make sure that anyone who entered the gate was killed, and he had to ensure that Souei was dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Gardner heard a cold voice saying, &ldquo;I knew it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After being decapitated and stabbed through the heart, Souei&rsquo;s body had dissipated into a black mist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Gardner shouted, but it was already too late to notice now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he hadn&rsquo;t lost his cool with Souei&rsquo;s plan, he might have realized that it was a Clone. But that was a matter of &ldquo;if&rdquo;, and there was no point in discussing it now. Gardner&rsquo;s failure would only lead to consequences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you wanted to use yourself as bait, a &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; would be enough. It seems that that power was wasted on you.&rdquo; Souei&rsquo;s voice echoed coldly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His point was so accurate that it cut Gardner to the heart. In fact, Gardner had met Velgrynd before. When he had just become a Saint, he had learned that the Marshal was a beautiful woman, and had gotten carried away with the idea that he could challenge here. As a result, he was defeated by a playful &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; in front of the elegantly seated Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that time, it was Velgrynd&rsquo;s power that he longed for and craved from the bottom of his heart. Gardner&rsquo;s favorite sword, the Seiryuuto, was also a gift from Velgrynd. Souei was not blind to this. Gardner had been dancing on Souei&rsquo;s palm from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Gardner screamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The absolute situation had shaken him to the core. If one doubted their own abilities, the more ultimate one&rsquo;s power is, the more it would affect them. There was no way Souei wouldn&rsquo;t make a move targeting that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re convinced, then you&rsquo;re dead!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, Souei was about to activate the Unique Skill &lsquo;Shadow Striker&rsquo;. In that moment, Gardner played his final hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uoooh waaa-raaa!! Then what about this, how about this? All of them are my body, and even if I&rsquo;ll die, I&rsquo;ll take down you with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Multiple &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo; attacked at once. All of them were the main body and defeating any one of them was pointless. It was the ultimate attack using &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;, which burned away at Gardner&rsquo;s life. It happened in less time than it took to blink. Therefore, it was difficult for Souei, who was aiming for a &lsquo;Shadow Striker&rsquo; attack, to avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The greatest weakness of the &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; used by Souei was that it could activate his Unique Skill except for the main body. Even Souei, who could control multiple &lsquo;Clones&rsquo; at the same time, had not been able to overcome this weakness. This was the difference between a &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;, so it was only natural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the main body is nearby, it can be made to look as if it is activating, but there will be a time delay. It would only be a gap against a superior opponent, so it had to be the main body that would deal the final blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kuh!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei thought to himself that he had let his guard down. It was common knowledge that the moment of stabbing was the most dangerous, and that one should not let one&rsquo;s guard down. For Souei, it was a blush-inducing blunder to fall into a crisis while knowing this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Forgive me, Rimuru-sama! I will definitely survive, and I will make up for this later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei tried to prepare for Gardner&rsquo;s final attack. Since he was not allowed to die, he had to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then:</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;I will not allow it. So, Souei, I will give you the power too.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei thought he heard a strange voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Th-This voice is&mdash;No, no!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instantly, he understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This voice must not be pursued or considered in any way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although it was unbecoming of a person in charge of the information department, Souei immediately decided as such.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&laquo;So be it. The name of the power I give you is&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if it were an innate power, Souei understood that power. And at the same time, in a field of consciousness that had been stretched a million times, he realized that his &lsquo;Clone&rsquo; had been transformed into a &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This meant that Souei had also acquired &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hahahahaha! I&rsquo;m dying, but this is the end of him too. He deserves it&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is that the end of your final will?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&mdash;how is that possible?! This is definitely your body&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And this is just my body too. If you understand, then die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Damn it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, Gardner had nothing left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thousand Hands Shadow Kill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei&rsquo;s shadow stretched out and became a thousand arms to capture Gardner. This was the effect of the Eye of the Moon, one of the powers of the Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Moon King Tsukuyomi&rsquo; that Souei had just acquired. The ability to manipulate shadows at will was a perfect match for Souei.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through the shadows, he could investigate the state of the world. And he could &lsquo;move&rsquo; wherever there is a shadow. By combining this with Parallel Existence, it was possible to create multiple arms and attack from the shadows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his body bound, Gardner cried out in anguish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can be proud of your victory. In any case, Velgrynd-sama and Granit-sama will take you down&mdash;&rdquo; His words died out before he could finish them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gardner&rsquo;s life was cut short by Souei&rsquo;s &lsquo;Insta-kill&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Velgrynd-sama has been defeated by Rimuru-sama. And Granit is headed for Benimaru, who is stronger than me. Perhaps the same as me&mdash;ah, that&rsquo;s no longer any of your business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Souei left those words and let Gardner disappear into the darkness.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image20.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><h2 class="c30" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c32 c14 c22 c17">Chapter 5</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c13 c21">The Truth of the Emperor</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada was alone thinking to himself while guarding one of the eight gates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Why had this happened to him?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The current situation was dire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Yuuki had fallen into Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s hands, and like his companions, was deprived of his free will. Having been ordered by Rudra to take care of him, Damrada could not resist. And now, Rudra had given him another order. After handing over the care of Yuuki to someone else, he was to board the Emperor&rsquo;s flagship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And so began the great battle in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The true identity of the Marshal as Velgrynd was told up to the sixth rank, but it could not be told to anyone. This was an absolute order, and for Damrada, who was often away from home, it was such an important secret that his memory was even manipulated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">That&rsquo;s right. I made a promise to that man. And that was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Seeing the Marshal turn into Velgrynd reminded Damrada of that. At the same time, many memories were clearly coming back to him. He remembered his most important promise to Rudra, but he also remembered the reason why he had to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Well then, what should I do&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There was no time to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The Demon Lord Rimuru he had seen a while ago seemed so benevolent that he didn&rsquo;t feel like much of a threat. As long as he was trapped in the strange space created by Velgrynd, he should not be able to interfere with the mission to capture Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Indeed, Veldora&rsquo;s domination was complete. This gave Rudra an advantage over Guy&mdash;But to Damrada, none of that mattered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Not only that, but for Rudra as well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With a clarity of thought that seemed to clear his foggy mind, Damrada wondered what was best for Rudra. However, before he could answer that question, Demon Lord Rimuru made his move. It was a fury of unprecedented proportions. Damrada was tempted to question himself as to why he had not thought of him as a threat. The mere fact that he had escaped Velgrynd&rsquo;s realm showed just how dangerous he was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But there was more to it than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">From the moment he saw Rimuru appear, Damrada realized that he had been too na&iuml;ve in his opinion. Rimuru had glanced at Damrada and the others with those glittering golden eyes. It was an unmistakably cold look, almost as if he did not even recognize Damrada and the others as enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou had responded immediately, but his attack was ineffective.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;&mdash;Is that all? In that case, there&rsquo;s no need to be wary. I will deal with you later. You can be afraid all you want. Try not to get killed until I deal with you.&mdash;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rimuru&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be telling him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">To Rimuru, Damrada and the others were already dead, weren&rsquo;t they? Emperor Rudra was no exception, and Damrada felt that if things continued as they were, they would all be killed together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What were the conditions for Rimuru&rsquo;s tactical victory in this situation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There were two conditions that needed to be met:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">1. Reclaiming Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">2. Eliminating the invaders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Veldora was an ally of Demon Lord Rimuru. To deprive Veldora of his free will would be unacceptable to Rimuru. The fact that he had come here meant that he was prepared to deal with Velgrynd. From Damrada&rsquo;s point of view, there was no telling how the battle would turn out. It was an unattainable pinnacle of a match-up, and it was not something that Damrada could predict.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As for the elimination of the invaders&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rimuru was said to be a pacifist, but one should not mistake that for non-resistance. There had been many acts of aggression towards them in the past, but they had all been repelled. They were not afraid of the means. With the help of Veldora, the monster nation had won many battles in a row.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rimuru would never forgive the Empire&rsquo;s aggression. The time for negotiations was over, and it was conceivable that the best course of action for him would be to kill all the Imperial soldiers. In that case, bargaining would be meaningless, and they would have to fight to the end. There was no guarantee that they would be forgiven even if they surrendered under the condition that neither side had any wartime agreements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was the Imperial side that had set a trap for Rimuru, who came to negotiate with them because he did not want to fight. They had lost all credibility and would not be trusted by Rimuru. The negotiation windows were closed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I should have been more serious about stopping His Majesty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada was also proud of the Empire&rsquo;s strength. He had been overconfident in the Empire&rsquo;s power, thinking that it could not be defeated and that they could set the victory conditions as they pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Show the enemy the majesty of the empire, defeat the enemy thoroughly, make them lose the will to rebel before swallowing them up. They could change the leadership, replace them with puppets, and do whatever they wanted as long as they won the war.&mdash;This was how the Empire had been able to expand its territory, but this time they had made a huge miscalculation. In addition to the fact that they were clashing with evenly matched forces, there was no guarantee that even Emperor Rudra would be safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was no wonder that Damrada was in a depressed mood.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">All that said, Damrada&rsquo;s real concern was about the promise made between himself and Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There was no doubt that Rimuru intended to kill Rudra. This made Damrada confused about how he should act. Damrada also wished to keep his promise to Rudra, but he wanted to accomplish it with his own hands However, it seemed difficult to win with Rimuru as an opponent&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada shuddered, analyzing the situation. The flagship had been enveloped in a terrible spell, and the survivors were now defending the eight gates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Could this really be called an even match?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">To Damrada, it seemed as if they had made a terrible mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And then came to now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Did I keep you waiting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Before Damrada&rsquo;s eyes was a girl smiling happily. This girl was one of the strongest in the world, a pillar of the seven primordial demons. Her &lsquo;name&rsquo; was Ultima, a subordinate under the control of Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Not only to add the primordials to his ranks, but to give them power&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was even more terrifying when one saw it up close.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As soon as the fearsome &lsquo;Death Streak&rsquo; was shown to be inordinately accurate and powerful, the demons&rsquo; evolution was assured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rimuru had opened a tremendously huge Demon Summoning Gate (Summon Gate) without regard to the fact that he was being watched. There was a hint that the subordinates he had summoned were up to something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He didn&rsquo;t have time to investigate it, but Ultima had given him the answer. Enjoying herself, Ultima let out a laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ahahahahaha, you noticed that? That&rsquo;s right, Rimuru-sama gave me the power, and now I&rsquo;m in great shape!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In contrast to Ultima, who was very happy, Damrada&rsquo;s was in a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Giving power to a &lsquo;primordial&rsquo;&mdash;After all, it was not something that a mere demon lord could do. Even Guy Crimson had not been able to evolve the primordials under his command. Thinking in that way, one could understand just how extraordinary Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s actions were. Even so, that did not mean that Damrada was willing to lose. In order to fulfill his promise to Rudra, he needed to challenge the demon named Ultima with all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t always aim for the most reasonable path. Even if I choose the path of hardship, it&rsquo;s fine as long as the result achieves my goal.&rdquo; Damrada stopped worrying. Even after witnessing Ultima&rsquo;s overwhelming power, he took an undaunted stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re going to do it, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll show you my power as His Majesty&rsquo;s knight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. So then, let&rsquo;s begin!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And so, the battle between Damrada, the second rank of the Single Digits, and Ultima, the &lsquo;Pain Lord&rsquo;, began.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

She could feel a power that was incredibly strong for a human. Even for a Saint, he was exceptional. His stance was so flawless that it might have been impossible for her to win had she not evolved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">That&rsquo;s it. He seems to be comparable to Hinata-san. That person was like a natural enemy of monsters, but this guy seems to have refined his skill-level purely against interpersonal and individual opponents. That type of person is really troublesome, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As far as Ultima was concerned, opponents who had honed their skill-level were troublesome. Hakurou was a good example of this, as he was able to deal with all sorts of situations with a variety of techniques. The ability to apply power was the secret of his strength. It was something that had nothing to do with superior beings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A demon is an overwhelmingly superior existence in comparison to a human. Just releasing their mana is enough to make it an attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima was one of the pinnacles of such demons. She was born knowing how to deal with mana and how to control mana perfectly. There was no need for effort. All she had to do was wish and it would come true. That was magic, and in the face of its overwhelming versatility, there was no opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Until recently, Ultima had believed that the only beings that could defeat her were primordial beings of the same rank, or non-standard beings such as the True Dragons. However, that belief had been wrong. It was during the battle with Velgrynd that Ultima became aware of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima and her team had put up a good fight against the overwhelmingly superior Velgrynd. They even succeeded in defeating one of the &lsquo;Split Bodies&rsquo;, albeit with only 10 percent of its power. In other words, she learned that if one misused their power, they could be defeated by a lower rank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In the battles that followed, there were many more lessons to be learned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A True Dragon, which was known as the strongest beings in the world, performed an elaborate and sophisticated manipulation of magic power. As a result, that power had overwhelmed Ultima, a race that excelled in magic, with magic. She hadn&rsquo;t known how that was possible while they were fighting. But now Ultima could understand. The secret was the act of adding an Ultimate Skill to magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">By using an Ultimate Skill, the control of magic becomes more precise. No wonder we couldn&rsquo;t beat her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even the magic Velgrynd cast in check had been too powerful for Ultima to handle. As for Carrera, she had been humiliated more than anything else by the fact that she was being dealt with by a better version of the magic she was best at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That right, it was a humiliation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But it was also a blessing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She had gotten the opportunity to experience that battle. And she had survived without being decisively defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Until now, Ultima had never imagined that just by incorporating the effects of Skill into magic, it could be doubled in power. The experience of that battle had made her realize new possibilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">It&rsquo;s true that our basic abilities are very high. That said, relying too much on our potential is also a problem. With more ingenuity, one can become even stronger!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima, the strongest of beings, had never aspired to gain power before. But this time, she wished to have it too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">How much stronger could a powerful being who is already invincible become, if they strive and work hard to reach a higher level?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The answer was someone like Velgrynd and Guy Crimson, she supposed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">From that perspective, there was no doubt that Diablo, who only pursued his own interests, was outside the norm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Testarossa, on the other hand, was completely different from Ultima and Carrera, who had never made any efforts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima was aware that she was the most inexperienced of the seven &ldquo;primordials&rdquo;. Even so, she was probably on par with Mizeri and Raine&hellip; But if she fought seriously, she felt that she would lose to Testarossa and Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Testarossa was gracefully perfect. She was self-confident and had a bad habit of looking down on others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera was arrogant and unprincipled. She could do everything perfectly well if she wanted to, but she quickly lost interest and would leave things behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And Ultima was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima did not have as precise of a magic power manipulation as Testarossa, nor did she have as great a mana pool as Carrera. Of the three &ldquo;devil lords&rdquo; (excluding Diablo), Ultima was probably the weakest. She was half-hearted in everything she did, and although she was a mass of talent, she had no experience of working for anything with her whole heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In this way, Ultima and Carrera were similar in many respects. That&rsquo;s why they had been rivals for so long. Nevertheless, Carrera had recently found a hobby in swordsmanship. Ultima had honestly felt envious of that. But that would end today. Ultima was blessed with the opportunity to awaken and gain the power she wished for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">That just means that I&rsquo;m the one with the most room to grow!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima had come to think as such, and now it felt like a funny story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was all thanks to Rimuru, who had become her master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima did not know how Rimuru was able to do such things, but those thoughts were irrelevant. What mattered was whether she could become a superior being. And whether or not she could be of use to Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">While watching over Agera&rsquo;s battle, Ultima continued to wish. At the end of her contemplation, she thought she heard a mysterious voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;In order to make this wish come true, let me help you just a little bit.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And the result was the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Poison King Samael&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It detected the weaknesses of all life forms and created a poison that induced a suitable state change. This was the power of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Poison King Samael&rsquo;. Now that she had this power, Ultima had no intention of losing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima suddenly remembered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsquo;Hone your skills and do not to rely too heavily on your strength&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Diablo had always said. She had been losing to Zegion, so she had assumed that Diablo was just telling her off. She had also thought that Diablo was just being a jerk because he had a bad personality. But that was Ultima&rsquo;s misunderstanding. It was true that his words were laced with sarcasm, but he was also thinking of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">How you control your power could make a world of difference in how strong you are&mdash;That was what Diablo was teaching them. After understanding that, she remembered Diablo&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Simply relying on the power you have been given is not how to acquire it&mdash;it&rsquo;s certainly true!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima was now deeply convinced. It was a line that had been said to her right after she had received her name, but she now thought it was true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Come to think of it, Diablo wouldn&rsquo;t use the power given to him by Rimuru-sama unless he was in trouble. I thought it was just in contempt for the enemy, but I guess he had a good reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsquo;I will do the same&rsquo;&mdash;Ultima decided to take advantage of this opportunity and use it to grow. Damrada was a tricky opponent, so this was a good time to give it all she had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Seriously. That Diablo, trying to teach us how to fight&hellip; He underestimates us too much, doesn&rsquo;t he? If Testa finds out that he thinks of us that way, she&rsquo;s going to get really mad and it&rsquo;ll be a big deal. Well, Testa might have just been taking advantage of the situation on purpose, but well, since this is a rare opportunity&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ll take advantage of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even Damrada, a formidable opponent, was nothing more than a training ground for Ultima. For the first time, she would use her Ultimate Skill and achieve victory. By doing so, Ultima would definitely grow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima swore to herself. She would win this battle, not by using the innate power that she always had, but by using the power that she had acquired from her desire to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">By doing so, she would prove it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rather than just hoping, she could be of help to Rimuru&mdash;Ultima thought as such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The battle was extremely fierce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima&rsquo;s attacks were outmatched by Damrada&rsquo;s techniques. In some cases, Damrada was able to offset Ultima head-on by concentrating all of his energy. It was Damrada&rsquo;s ability to react quickly and flexibly that made him so powerful. Ultima was frankly impressed by this and found it amusing. She realized a lot of things in the fight against Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I see, so this kind of flow keeps the body intact. In that case, this is an approach that might work with Zegion-san!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Zegion was so powerful that she was defeated the moment she got close. That was not suitable for combat training, let alone actual combat. On the other hand, Damrada was a most suitable opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima realized how fortunate she had been. With her overwhelming mana, she could easily defend against any attack. She could have crushed any foe with brute force alone. She had thought she understood this, but now it was fully recognized with more realism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The power of both sides increased, and the battle grew more intense.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Or so it seemed at first glance&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hahaha, this is fun! I couldn&rsquo;t last this long against Zegion-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima seemed to be enjoying herself. Damrada, on the other hand, had a bitter expression on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Treating this fight as a training session&hellip; You&rsquo;re playing me as a fool.&rdquo; Despite saying this, Damrada was aware of it in his heart. If this continued, Damrada was the one who would be defeated. Ultima was still growing, but Damrada was already at full strength. He had no time to enjoy the thrill of this battle, and was using all of his skills just to try to defeat Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In the first place, a primordial demon was essentially the poster child of magic. Against an existence that could even rewrite the physical laws of the world, a half-hearted attack would not work. Therefore, Damrada was inflicting damage to Ultima by adding the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; effect to all of his attacks. Having spent more than 2,000 years studying it, he could exercise its powers as if it were breathing. It had become so familiar to Damrada that he had forgotten that it had been lent to him by Rudra. In addition, a demon had its shackles. Although this one seemed to have been released now, there was a limit to the amount of magicules they could possess. Because of this, the &lsquo;Saint&rsquo; Damrada had a higher total amount of energy compared to Ultima. That was why he was only just able to compete with Ultima on equal terms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">The more I attack, the more I am exposing my hand, but even using my big move may not be effective. This is&hellip; Unwinnable, huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada coughed up blood. Ultima was stealing the skills that he had worked so hard to acquire. It would have been better if she had decided to make quick work of this, but she knew that such a move would leave her open to self-destruction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even now, he was able to cancel out all of Ultima&rsquo;s multiple attacks of the same power at the same time, but Ultima was not frustrated&mdash;she looked happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awesome, just like a demonstration!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Now it was Damrada&rsquo;s turn to feel frustrated. Damrada was now cornered. He was in no position to show off his skills, and as soon as he showed them, she would copy him. Just like a dry sand absorbing water, he could feel that Ultima was growing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Hahaha, I can only laugh. </span><span class="c1 c5">He couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada could never have imagined how horrifying these &ldquo;primordials&rdquo; were.</span><span class="c1 c2 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c5">To an outsider, it might seem as if their abilities were on par with each other. However, that balance would soon be broken. As long as one side continued to grow, the scales would eventually tilt in her favor. That was the stark reality. And that time would come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Aha! I&rsquo;m starting to get it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As soon as she shouted this, the aura around Ultima changed. Until now, she had been saving her power to steal Damrada&rsquo;s technique. After releasing her power, six pairs of twelve total wings spread out on Ultima&rsquo;s back. Like the wings of a bat, the featherless flight apparatuses were glossy, smooth, and glowed a light purple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Here we go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Kuh?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">After Ultima shouted, the twelve wings began to move simultaneously. They changed shape in a variety of ways as they aimed at Damrada. Some were as thin as blades, some were as sharp as needles, and some were clumped together like fists. The ever-changing wings made them very difficult to escape from, let alone deal with&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada tried to parry the fist-shaped one, but was blown away as soon as he made contact. The force of the blow was incomparably greater than anything Damrada had seen before, and it was so fierce that Damrada could not cancel it out. Moreover, to his horror, Ultima&rsquo;s power was increasing rapidly. Now that there was no upper limit to the amount of magicule, it seemed as if her power would increase as much as she wanted it to, and there was no sign of her momentum decreasing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Chi!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hahahaha! I love that kind of expression.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmph! Don&rsquo;t mess with me, little girl. The power is amazing, but I simply have to avoid being hit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada summoned up more energy than ever before and concentrated on avoiding the attack. Although he acted as if he was fine, he felt a growing sense of danger inside him. He couldn&rsquo;t win at this rate. But Ultima remained untouched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If there was no opening, he would have to make one&mdash;Damrada dared to take a desperate action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">One of the wings pierced Damrada&rsquo;s leg. It looked like Damrada had failed to avoid it, but that was exactly what Damrada was planning. As a race that prided themselves on their great power, demons were prone to arrogance. Damrada&rsquo;s goal was to act on the assumption that even Ultima would be caught off guard if she was sure of her victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ahahahaha, I thought you were going to keep avoiding them? Or did you get tired?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With a wicked grin, Ultima relaxed her attack and began to torment Damrada. The wings began to move as if to pierce the extremities, not the vital parts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I know. You&rsquo;re strong. That&rsquo;s why you look down on us and fail at the critical moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada was convinced that his plan would succeed. He pretended to be injured and fell down, then attempted to strike Ultima with all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Seihahouken</span><sup class="c1 c18 c5"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was Damrada&rsquo;s special move. It was a blow made up with the full power of a Saint&rsquo;s fighting spirit, tempered with &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo;. No matter how powerful a creature it was, it would disappear if hit by this move. Even the primordial Ultima had no choice but to disappear if her body was destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada thought he had won, but he did not feel the aftermath of his victory. For some reason, he felt a chill as he tried to finish off Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What collapsed was a piece of a wing that had fallen away. It seemed to have changed shape to resemble Ultima, but Damrada was unable to see it. By the time he realized it, it was too late.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Death Poison Fist!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima pierced Damrada&rsquo;s chest.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In imitation of Damrada, she concentrated a huge amount of mana in her piercing hand, but she controlled it perfectly by activating her Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Poison King Samael&rsquo;. Moreover, the five fingernails were dyed purple due to the &lsquo;deadly poison&rsquo; that was from the &lsquo;Poison King Samael&rsquo;. Damrada&rsquo;s defense was crushed by the power of the poison, which far exceeded the lethal dose. With this, the outcome of victory or defeat had been decided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Guh!!&rdquo; Damrada coughed up blood and collapsed on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ahahahaha, my bad! I was right on target!!&rdquo; It was a wicked roar of laughter that rang out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada tried to stand up again, but failed. All the strength had drained out of his body and he could not stand up or even clench his fists. Still, he gathered his strength to look up and glare at Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Fool, that&rsquo;s not a fist attack. That was a piercing hand. You only saw it once, so you can&rsquo;t imitate me&hellip; But that power is unmistakable&hellip;truly wonderful. Brilliant. It would be more appropriate to call it &lsquo;Bloody Bite&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And with that, Damrada looked up to the sky in satisfaction. As he looked up, he smiled a little ruefully. This battle had been a complete defeat. Before they could challenge Guy to a decisive battle, they were crushed by Demon Lord Rimuru. Some of the elite may survive, but it would be impossible to rebuild.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Emperor Rudra did not have the strength to wait for the next opportunity. Before then, the current Rudra would already have been&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;Damrada whispered, reflecting on his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Damrada, can I have your attention?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What is it? If you want to complain about something, just talk to Velgrynd-sama. Or are you complaining about Velgrynd-sama? If so, direct it to her, and not me. I don&rsquo;t want her to think that I&rsquo;m complaining too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a cold person&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s not what I meant. I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;Pardon? What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He didn&rsquo;t want to hear it. From the moment he had looked into Rudra&rsquo;s eyes, he knew that it was serious. But once he listened to it, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have the relationship they had now. Damrada didn&rsquo;t like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Apparently, my mind wears out every time I reincarnate. Or rather, in Guy&rsquo;s words, it&rsquo;s probably the &lsquo;soul&rsquo;, but that&rsquo;s not important. What&rsquo;s important is that I eventually might not be me anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As a &lsquo;Hero&rsquo;, Rudra&rsquo;s reincarnation was not due to magic. It was a special ritual to inherit his overpowering power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There was a price for a mortal to gain power that surpassed even that of the True Dragons, the ultimate spirit life forms. It was Rudra&rsquo;s own right to control it. Therefore, Damrada could not offer a solution&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;A wearing of the soul, huh? After that, Your Majesty will cease to be yourself&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ahh, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny joke. But I&rsquo;m not so naive as to take that seriously and shorten your workload.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Che, you&rsquo;re still such a serious guy, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s my strong point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hah, that&rsquo;s true. I just said something boring, so forget it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">How could he forget?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada had only run away. He wanted to keep the relationship as it was, and he wanted to serve Rudra forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And then, time passed on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ahhh, I knew it. It seems that every time I&rsquo;m reborn, I lose something important. The problem is, I don&rsquo;t even know what it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hey, Damrada.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;This is an order. If I&rsquo;m no longer myself, you will kill me with your own hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Rudra-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I could ask Velgrynd to do this, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do this either&rsquo;&mdash;Damrada swallowed those words with all his might. If this was his best friend Rudra&rsquo;s heartfelt wish, then there was no way he could say no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Good grief, you&rsquo;re weak. But if that should happen, I promise I&rsquo;ll take care of Rudra-sama. So don&rsquo;t worry, just rest assured and work hard in your affairs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Fufu, you&rsquo;re still the same as usual. I&rsquo;m in good hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That was the promise of a distant day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And then, more time passed&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired. There is a limit to how much I can control my &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;. Absolute justice, when you get right down to it, is not much different from evil. There is no such thing as a justice that all people recognize in this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Damrada, the promise we made, do you remember?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">When Rudra heard the reply, he smiled, saying &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Changing his expression, he gave the order solemnly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Damrada, I have an order. Just in case you fail, find me someone who can defeat Justice King Michael and defeat me! It pains me to ask this of you, but&hellip;while I am still myself, I must make sure everything is in order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The order was equivalent to an order to kill Rudra himself, but Damrada could only nod.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Your orders, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Upon hearing Damrada&rsquo;s reply, Rudra muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; As if talking to himself, Rudra looked off into the distance and began to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Looking back, the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; entrusted to me by my friend may have been too powerful for me. Whether I win or lose in this game with Guy, this will be my last use of it. I want to fully master this Skill, but&hellip;if it shows any signs of getting out of control, do not hesitate. You must stop me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;Thank you.&rdquo; As soon as he said this, Rudra closed his eyes. Then he remembered the vow he had made to Veldanava, the Star King Dragon a long time ago, and felt frustrated that he could not keep it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A small murmur escaped from his mouth&mdash;&ldquo;If I fail to fulfill my promise, I will apologize to you in the afterlife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada pretended not to have heard this, and quietly left the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Choking on the blood leaking from his mouth, Damrada was jolted back to reality. For less than a few tenths of a second, he seemed to have lost consciousness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&mdash;Your Majesty, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; I&rsquo;m so sorry. I&hellip; I was unable to fulfill your order&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In his fading consciousness, Damrada tried to express his regret. But it was not to be, and he could only vomit blood once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Regret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">However, there was also a sense of relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The order to seek out those who would murder his beloved lord&mdash;it had been painful for Damrada. He had been suffering for a long time. It was only natural. Because to Damrada, Emperor Rudra was still the same glorious champion had had always been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">You&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t possibly kill you!! Why me? Why can&rsquo;t it be someone else? I have no attachment to this world if you no longer exist here. I wish to go with you on your journey from death&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That was what Damrada truly wished for in his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The game between Guy and Rudra didn&rsquo;t matter to Damrada. What mattered to him was Rudra&rsquo;s will, and the world that reflected it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Guy Crimson was an arrogant demon lord, but he was not an unreasonable tyrant. His rule was absolute, but he also had set proper rules for himself and stubbornly kept to them. Guy and Rudra&rsquo;s ideals were different, but they were never incompatible. From Damrada&rsquo;s point of view, they seemed to be perfectly capable of compromise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Guy would not make a move on his own. Rudra must have given his orders to Damrada because he was sure of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Why did they insist on fighting when it&rsquo;s clear that there was mutual recognition?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That was Damrada&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But there was no way he could disobey Rudra&rsquo;s orders, and in the end, he followed them and began his activities around the world. Long after leaving the Emperor&rsquo;s service, a candidate was found. A boy named Yuuki Kagurazaka, who possessed the super peculiar constitution of &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo;. Damrada had thought that he would be able to defeat the Justice King Michael if he could nullify even the Ultimate Skill, but the result had been a disastrous defeat. Yuuki had fallen into Rudra&rsquo;s hands, and he could no longer be relied upon. Thus, Damrada lost his trump card, but now a question arose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;Why, Your Majesty Rudra, did you take control of Yuuki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huh, what?&rdquo; Ultima asked back, an unintentional murmur escaping her lips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Without answering, Damrada continued to ponder. Rudra himself was the one who had ordered Damrada to find someone who could kill him. And yet he didn&rsquo;t see why he should interfere with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">No, it wasn&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s just that Damrada didn&rsquo;t want to admit it. The signs had been there all along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;So, after all&hellip; His Majesty Rudra-sama is already&hellip;&rdquo; Damrada muttered as if in a fever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What the hell are you talking about?!&rdquo; Ultima shouted in frustration, but her voice did not reach Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada was now lost in his own thoughts. It was like a flash of inspiration before death, but Damrada&rsquo;s thoughts were now clear. Therefore, he would arrive at the truth.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rudra burned with passion for his ideals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He would unite the world and establish lasting peace. He dreamed of an end to strife and poverty and the development of mankind. Once all mankind was united and at peace, everyone would be able to live equally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rudra believed in this and set out to establish a unified nation. He believed that human beings were capable of understanding each other. He believed from the bottom of his heart that they could eventually unite into a single will and create a better world. He became a hero for the sake of the people and took upon great hardships. Rudra was working hard for the hope that many people would live a happy life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada liked such a Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rudra&rsquo;s ideal remained a dream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It couldn&rsquo;t be helped that Rudra himself had changed before the day of fulfillment arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">The ideals we pursued turned out to be crushed long ago&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada acknowledged this and was filled with a deep sadness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Are you crying?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;Ahhh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re afraid of dying?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;No. Because I made a promise&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;A promise?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;Ahhh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The inevitability of death had gripped Damrada.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He had no choice but to resign himself to the fact that there was nothing he could do about it, yet Damrada couldn&rsquo;t stand the fact that he was unable to keep his promise to Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If Rudra&rsquo;s will had disappeared, then who was Rudra now? There was only one answer to that question. It had to be the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;&mdash;the ultimate power given to Rudra by his friend &lsquo;Star King Dragon&rsquo; Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Before Rudra&rsquo;s mind had collapsed, Damrada needed to fulfill the imperial order. And yet&hellip;apparently, he was unable to do so, and Damrada&rsquo;s life was coming to an end. Damrada wanted to curse his own incompetence, but he reminded himself that the situation was not yet at its worst. He had to stop the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; at all costs. If Damrada failed, he would have to find someone else to take over the task. It was an order from Rudra, and a promise that Damrada had to keep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada had found Yuuki, but he knew of one other person. The dreaded demon lord, Rimuru. His greatest enemy was also his greatest hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;May I ask you to kill His Majesty&hellip;Rudra-sama&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What? Why me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have to be you. But to the demon lord, Rimuru&hellip;this message&hellip;can&rsquo;t you ask&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;No, just let me take care of that. We were going to kill this Rudra guy anyway, not that we couldn&rsquo;t accept your request.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima&rsquo;s character did as she pleased. She was fickle, so she didn&rsquo;t take things lying down, but she liked Damrada. It had been a short fight, but for Ultima, who had an infinite lifespan, quality was better than quantity. Just the taste of the concentrated and intense fight made her feel like she could forgive everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;Then, one more thing&hellip;want to ask&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That person&hellip;a boy named Masayuki&hellip;please protect him&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada was sure of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Masayuki was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s fine. But it comes at a cost, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The devil did not work for free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was not an absolute rule, so there were plenty of ways around it. But this time, Ultima was being selfish. She wanted to annoy Damrada, so she asked the question. However, upon hearing Ultima&rsquo;s question, Damrada felt relieved. With a sense of peace that liberated his mind, he replied calmly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;The reward is all that I have. My soul as well&hellip;all of my Skills. I leave it to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Accepted, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Looking at Ultima, who gave a reluctant reply, Damrada&rsquo;s expression broke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;Your Majesty Rudra&hellip;now, I will go to your side&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Those were Damrada&rsquo;s last words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada breathed his last as if falling asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada, the former Prime Minister of the Nasca Kingdom and close friend of the united Emperor Rudra Nam Ul Nasca.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The &lsquo;Fist Saint&rsquo; Damrada&rsquo;s long life had finally come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultima stood alone in the circular colosseum in the isolated space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ahh, how boring. The nucleus is gone. I was going to give it to Rimuru-sama, but&hellip;&rdquo; Ultima murmured sadly, and gently wrapped Damrada&rsquo;s body in her twelve wings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In accordance with her contract, she had taken all of Damrada for herself. And that was the end of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was the end of the battle between Damrada and Ultima.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;The life of the &ldquo;Fist Saint&rdquo; had come to an end, and a new &ldquo;Fist Demon&rdquo; was born&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Damrada, in his last moment, had given the deadliest power to one of the most vicious demons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If he had known, would he have felt ashamed of himself? Or perhaps he was happy to have a successor to his technique. Now that Damrada was gone, there was no way to know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Those who survived could only consider this question in their hearts.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

He did not respond to Agera, but glanced at Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You can relax. I&rsquo;m only here as a witness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Nonsense. I can&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou finally opened his mouth, but his words were quite scathing. They were enemies anyway, so he was telling them to come at him at the same time. Carrera, however, was unmoved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;re right. I don&rsquo;t think two against one is cowardly, and I&rsquo;m not planning to go easy on you, however this time, it&rsquo;s Agera&rsquo;s wish. Don&rsquo;t worry about me and just have fun.&rdquo; She said as much as she could before sitting down along the stone wall as if she had nothing to do with this. Kondou shrugged his shoulders and replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What a farce. But I&rsquo;ll give you credit for your spirit.&rdquo; Then he drew his sword and confronted Agera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I thank you. Now then, let&rsquo;s get&mdash;&rdquo; His words were cut short by a loud bang. Agera collapsed to the ground, clutching his chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera, who had closed the distance in the blink of an eye, stepped in between Kondou and Agera. Kondou swung his sword to cut off Agera&rsquo;s head, but was stopped by Carrera&rsquo;s sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmph. Can you make it at this speed?&rdquo; Kondou said to Carrera, holding a smoking Nambu pistol in his right hand and wielding a single sword in his left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You knew I couldn&rsquo;t make it in time, didn&rsquo;t you? If you were serious, Agera would have been wiped out by now, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou had never said he would accept the match against Agera, so this was Agera&rsquo;s own fault for not checking. Besides, the final blow was not serious at all. Carrera, who had caught the sword, understood this fact best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Someone as strong as Kondou would not have lost even if he fought Agera head on. If it was only a sword fight, it would have been close, but even so, Kondou&rsquo;s victory would have been unassailable in the end. Even so, Kondou made a surprise attack because Carrera had been on the sidelines. Believing the words of an enemy was outrageous, so it would be foolish to listen to the words of a devil. Eliminating uncertainty was an ironclad rule of warfare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well now, just what are you talking about? I don&rsquo;t have time for that nonsense.&rdquo; Kondou turned to Carrera and sneered at the state of affairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right. If you&rsquo;re up for it, I&rsquo;ll be your next opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;With that sword?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou pointed to Carrera&rsquo;s sword, which had cracked under the blow. If she struck it again and again, it would surely break, and Carrera would not be oblivious to that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;No way. There are alternatives, only I&rsquo;ve got something better than that. Agera, you understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;Of course. It is a shame that I could not cross swords with a descendant of my own school, but considering that you follow my teachings, I cannot complain. What I do not like is that he made a fool of me and deprived me of my fighting power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Saying this, Agera stood up. Already, the hole in his chest had been filled. The bullet that Kondou shot Agera with was called an &ldquo;Eraser,&rdquo; and it had the effect of dissipating as much energy as the mana it was loaded with. If it had been the &ldquo;Necrosis&rdquo;, Agera would have had difficulty standing up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As Carrera and Agera realized, it was obvious that Kondou had cut corners. However&mdash;that was why Agera could still fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Blade Transformation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Agera was transformed into a single sword. Needless to say, Carrera was the one who took it in hand. Carrera&rsquo;s mana filled Agera, and his lost energy was restored. As a result, the blade glowed, showing that Agera was full of energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;How foolish. I would have let you off the hook if I believed you were a fellow comrade&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;My dependents love to fight, so it&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I see. Well, it&rsquo;s not important now. That person committed the unforgivable sin of impersonating the founder of the art. I will do everything in my power to make him pay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">To Kondou, the Carrera who was holding Agera in her hands was just as guilty. He bared his clear hostility and showed his seriousness.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Half an hour had passed since the battle began. Carrera was kneeling on the ground. Incredibly, Kondou was showing to be terribly strong. A master, indeed. Even to Carrera, he was a monster beyond imagination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera knew that she was strong. But at the same time, she understood that there were stronger people out there. In fact, even if she couldn&rsquo;t beat Diablo, one might have thought that she wouldn&rsquo;t lose to anyone else. And yet, Zegion had beaten her easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In this war as well, she had been completely outmatched against Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">So even though she was at Kondou&rsquo;s mercy, she wasn&rsquo;t surprised. On the contrary, she felt excited and uplifted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera rolled on the ground to keep distance from Kondou. She then stood up and took up the seigan stance</span><sup class="c1 c18 c5"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good! Even Agera complimented my swordsmanship, but it seems I am still no match for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Shut up. I am only trying to use all my power to defeat my opponent, saying that is upsetting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou, true to himself, found Carrera&rsquo;s sense of combat very uncanny. Now was not the time to be fooling around, so he had been going all out from the start. He was using not only his sword skills but also his Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo; without any hesitation. And yet, he was unable to finish Carrera off. That alone was astonishing, and Kondou shuddered inwardly. It seemed that they were not easy opponents, and both had recognized one another. From that point on, the battle intensified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera struck Kondou with a powerful sword blow, blocking his movements. Kondou parried the sword lightly and aimed at Carrera with the gun in his right hand. The power contained in the bullet was to disarm magic. The bullet was called &ldquo;Dispel.&rdquo; The reason Kondou fired it could be seen in Carrera&rsquo;s next action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Without any chanting, a gravitational force field was formed instantly. Kondou noted that this was a feat of strength, but rather than reflecting on it, Carrera resorted to more power, invoking a spell that did not affect her, and hoping to block Kondou&rsquo;s movement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Anticipating this, Kondou chose to use &ldquo;Dispel.&rdquo; This versatility was Kondou&rsquo;s strength. The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo; had four main effects, and Kondou used them differently depending on the time and situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Remove&rdquo; broke the target&rsquo;s Defense Barrier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Dispel&rdquo; counteracted magic effects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Necrosis&rdquo; destroyed the target&rsquo;s mana circuit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Eraser&rdquo; was a high-density mana bullet. It also drained energy by detecting the nature of the target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">All of these effects were combined in &ldquo;Judgment,&rdquo; the most powerful bullet of all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera had always been one to chant spells in her magic attacks. It was a stepping stone to this time, but all of those spells were lifted the moment she cast them. Kondou&rsquo;s reading had been accurate, and he had made the right choice. Moreover, he would fire various kinds of bullets at any opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If Carrera didn&rsquo;t recognize the nature of the bullets and deal with them properly, she would be hurt badly. If she had been careless, the game would have been over in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou had analyzed the battle very calmly. He did not show any emotion and was even mechanical about it. He saw through the enemy&rsquo;s weaknesses and the flow of mana and took the most appropriate action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That was all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">By sticking to the basics, Kondou had maintained his position as the strongest in the Imperial Army. This was in stark contrast to Carrera, who let her emotions get the better of her, yet the two were very similar. Carrera shook her head in dismay and asked Kondou in a friendly manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tricky. How did you know I was going to use magic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou also responded to Carrera, gesturing for her to catch her breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huh, that&rsquo;s simple. It&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s what I would do if I were you, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I see. That really is a simple explanation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Once again, Carrera was impressed by this Kondou man. At the same time, she realized that Kondou was the most powerful enemy she had ever faced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">How can he just read the flow of mana used to activate the spell and cut off the flow? How can he just say that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I would do&rsquo;&mdash;was what he said. What a terrible excuse. Carrera felt bitter, but her expression was unable to hide her joy. It was nice to know that there was someone you could fight with all your might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Demon Lord Leon was a strong opponent that Guy recognized. It was supposed to be a satisfying fight, but Carrera&rsquo;s challenge had not been met with any response. It had been disappointing, annoying, and frustrating, but&hellip;with Kondou as her opponent, she could enjoy the fight to the fullest. To Carrera, the process of fighting was more important than winning or losing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, very good. It&rsquo;s Kondou, right? You&rsquo;re the best enemy I&rsquo;ve ever had!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera praised him sincerely, but Kondou only snorted and brushed it off. He did not speak in words, but gave his opinion with his sword. A sharp slash was launched at Carrera. Even though he was swinging with only his left hand, his sword line did not waver, and was even more beautiful than the demonstration of a master.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera dealt with Kondou&rsquo;s continuous slashes, relying on Agera&rsquo;s skill and her own intuition. After a brief exchange of sword clashes, Carrera discovered that Kondou had a few quirks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A sword in his left hand, a gun in his right. This was Kondou&rsquo;s fighting style, but at the moment of firing his gun, his eyes and fingertips were linked, and she could read the line of fire of the bullets. It was a small quirk that only someone like Carrera could have detected, but it was still a fatal flaw that was more than enough to decide the match.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Here!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With perfect timing, Carrera swung her sword. Kondou, who was about to fire his gun, could not react to the movement. As if without thinking, he forced himself to hold up his gun to deflect Carrera&rsquo;s sword. His reaction speed was impressive, but that was not enough to stop Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me! I&rsquo;ve taken away one of your trump cards!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou twisted his body into an impossible position to resist, but it seemed that he could not resist Carrera&rsquo;s strength. He was forced to let go of the gun. The Nambu pistol rolled to the ground. Carrera was elated that she had given Kondou the slip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There was a creepy sensation. As soon as she felt it, Carrera instinctively jumped back from the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was Kondou&rsquo;s sword that slashed through the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Damn, I failed to finish it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera&rsquo;s severed left arm fell to the ground with a thud. It was cut off by Kondou&rsquo;s sword, as if without any regard to the orichalcum skeleton.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You bastard!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera is furious, but her mind was calm. She acknowledged the reality of the situation while trembling with humiliation. She would never be able to beat Kondou at this rate. As proof of this, Kondou was now holding a military sword with both hands. His form was one of perfected beauty, and even his demeanor was different from before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She had no choice but to accept that Kondou did not intend to rely on the gun from the beginning. His purpose had been to lure Carrera by daring to create an opening. If that was the case, Carrera had been underestimated by Kondou. He could have fought her with just her sword, but he didn&rsquo;t show it and instead played tricks on her&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">It was probably just a trick to make it easier for him to kill me, but&hellip;how could such an expert do such a despicable thing as not showing his full strength? That&rsquo;s unforgivable. </span><span class="c1 c5">Recognizing this, Carrera roared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;How dare you underestimate me, a human!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In a fit of rage, Carrera tried to take a step forward to tear Kondou to pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But at that moment&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Please wait, Carrera-sama.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Agera, who had been transformed into Carrera&rsquo;s sword, spoke to Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera and Agera were now in a state of near unity. Naturally, they were connected by a &lsquo;telepathy net&rsquo;, so they could talk to each other with their minds. And so, in the field of consciousness that had been stretched a millionfold by Carrera&rsquo;s power, they began to talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;What is it, Agera? I&rsquo;m busy right now, so if you interrupt me, I&rsquo;ll kill you too.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Calm down, Carrera-sama. If you lose your cool like that, Kondou will have his way.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;I know what I&rsquo;m doing. But he made me look like a fool. Me, the king? I&rsquo;ll never forgive him.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Lately, it had become Agera&rsquo;s role to stop Carrera, but even Agera had never seen Carrera as angry as she was today. If he didn&rsquo;t stop her now, Carrera would inevitably lose. Agera earnestly tried to persuade Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Listen. The reason Kondou did not resort to the sword from the beginning was not because he underestimated Carrera-sama.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Why not? No matter how you look at it, he&rsquo;s underestimating me!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;No, he&rsquo;s not. Rather, it&rsquo;s for the exact opposite reason.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Huh?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Because he perceived Carrera-sama as a threat, Kondou is trying to keep his cards close to his chest. Not everyone is born as strong as Carrera-sama. It&rsquo;s only natural for a warrior to be mindful of fighting a strong enemy!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Then what is it? Are you saying that he approves of me?&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;That&rsquo;s right!!&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Agera was making points here and there. Kondou&rsquo;s style was complete in its own way, but in his essence, he was a swordsman who had inherited Agera&rsquo;s style. There was no doubt that Kondou&rsquo;s style was more serious, but that was why he did not expose it from the beginning and instead switched to it at the right moment. The gap he showed when firing the gun must have been created by his nerve-wracking training. He must have used it because he recognized Carrera as a strong opponent. Otherwise, he would not have dared to take such a risk by making such an elaborate move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;&hellip;I see, that&rsquo;s true, if you say so&hellip;&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Thanks to Agera&rsquo;s persuasion, Carrera regained her composure and agreed. Agera breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for worrying you, Agera. Thanks to you, I&rsquo;ve come to my senses.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;I promise not to worry you anymore.&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With that declaration, Carrera turned to Kondou once again. Then, without hesitation, a fist struck her once in the face. At such a blow, one would wonder how Carrera&rsquo;s head didn&rsquo;t explode. However, Carrera did not care and even smiled at Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hey, I didn&rsquo;t scare you, did I? I&rsquo;m sorry, I just slightly lost my cool because I mistakenly thought you underestimated me. Even so, it&rsquo;s amazing what humans can do. They really do have a lot of tricks up their sleeve to win. I was a little surprised because I had never thought of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera laughed but knew not to underestimate the enemy. She was not careless, but without Agera, she would have been taken in by Kondou&rsquo;s schemes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The Carrera of today was not the Carrera of the past where selfishness was acceptable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As a loyal subordinate of the Demon Lord Rimuru, she now acted in accordance to the orders of her lord. Aside from defeat, she could not afford to die. Carrera warned herself in her mind. That blow had been for that very purpose, and as a statement of her resolve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera now acknowledged Kondou. The two of them were equals. It was a very serious thought, not typical of Carrera&rsquo;s casual nature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What a surprise. You know&hellip; I never really thought of humans as real opponents&hellip;but now I am taking them seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Perhaps it was the pride of being the strongest race that always made her unconsciously fail to use her full strength when fighting others. Even so, she had mistakenly assumed that Kondou had not been giving it his all and had to be admonished by Agera. Carrera realized her mistake and finally got serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou looked at the ghastly grin on Carrera&rsquo;s face and felt that it was beautiful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Is the demon getting serious? As a vulnerable human, that is not something I should welcome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">For the first time, his expression changed, and he recognized Carrera as the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Then, I, too, must take you seriously.&rdquo; Kondou declared, putting on his &ldquo;armor&rdquo; for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was no longer the uniform that relied on the power of will, but a pure white spiritual armor that was a variation of the mythical-grade armaments given to him by Rudra. It resembled the ceremonial robes of the old Imperial Navy. While it was not that big of a change in appearance, the atmosphere was that of a different person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">For Kondou, the ceremonial robe of his naval days was also a garment for death. As a lieutenant, he had caused the deaths of his men, and he had vowed to live with the guilt. In order to remember that resolve, he wore these garbs in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera looked at Kondou and released mana in a deep and loud voice. Then, she said her name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I am a loyal servant of Demon Lord Rimuru-sama, and one of the Twelve Chaos Guardian Lords. &ldquo;Menace Lord&rdquo; Carrera. I will kill you upon my pride.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I am Tatsuya Kondou, a former lieutenant in the Imperial Navy. I am now the Commander of the Imperial Guardians, and I accept your challenge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The two sides stared at each other, quietly building up their strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Now, the real battle would begin.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

And just like that, the pieces were back together as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unreasonable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say that. Rimuru-sama gave me this precious body, so I can&rsquo;t leave a single scar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">They were talking in a light tone, but both of them were looking for an opening. Kondou waited for Carrera&rsquo;s arm to heal because he had his own agenda.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Now that he had given up his pistol, Kondou would fight with only his sword. This was the true nature of the &ldquo;Oboro Shinmei-ryu&rdquo;, but it also meant that he had no other options left. Kondou was now serious. This meant that Kondou was betting everything he had. Now that he held the sword in both hands, he was confident that he could defeat any enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou used his Unique Skill &lsquo;Decipherer&rsquo; to read Carrera&rsquo;s movements. He could read not only the movement of her muscles, but also the flow of mana that filled her body, and even the signs of magic being activated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This ability was linked to the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo;, and its performance was far beyond the realm of the unique-level. For that reason, he didn&rsquo;t miss the fact that Carrera&rsquo;s power had begun to grow abnormally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A tremendous energy that seemed to symbolize Carrera&rsquo;s tyranny. And yet, as if unified by a great will, there was no stagnation in its flow. The energy that would normally have produced an explosive torrent was perfectly under Carrera&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">What a monster</span><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;Kondou thought. The arm that he had taken so much trouble to cut off&mdash;now there was not even a trace of it left. Even her clothes had been mended. What a joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The focus of her raging energy was the sword that Agera has transformed into. The circulation of power was complete, thanks to the fact that he and Carrera were one and the same. From Kondou&rsquo;s point of view, this was an abhorrent situation, and he found it even more troubling. Incredibly, at the center of Carrera&rsquo;s mana, a fearsome crystal of power was forming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou had an idea of what it was. He knew it because he had acquired it himself. It was something that could only be seen when the form of the heart materialized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">This person&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure of it. Is she trying to acquire an Ultimate Skill?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As soon as he confirmed this, Kondou moved. No matter how powerful the enemy was, they needed to be eliminated quickly. That was the reason why he put on the ceremonial robe, a sign of his seriousness. In other words, defeat was not allowed. No matter what means were used, he had to win. It was the side of the victor that was justice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">While examining Carrera, Kondou finished his preparations. All that remained was his sword. With all his might, he slashed at Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Good, good! You&rsquo;re giving me such a thrill with those unhesitating eyes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou swung his sword, paying no heed to Carrera&rsquo;s gleeful cries. Although it was caught by Carrera&rsquo;s demon sword, Kondou&rsquo;s sword was very powerful. If it had not been for Agera&rsquo;s will, it might have been broken by the blow. Kondou added another series of blows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera groaned as she was struck by the sharp and heavy slash. The secret of the power lay in the intent behind the sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou&rsquo;s Ultimate Skill, &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo;, was not just a power that could be put into a bullet. It was only when Kondou&rsquo;s will was embedded in his sword, which could be called his soul, that it showed its true essence. That was Kondou&rsquo;s inner workings and his true form.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou&rsquo;s onslaught began, and Carrera was on the defensive. Kondou was determined to end the battle before Carrera awakened to her ultimate power. Using every technique at his disposal, he hunted Carrera down. Even though Carrera controlled her violence and showed great power, Kondou parried everything without changing his expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou&rsquo;s fighting skills were superior to Carrera&rsquo;s. The reason why the battle was barely viable was that Carrera had a huge amount of magicules and Agera&rsquo;s skill-level was added onto it. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, Carrera would have been destroyed long ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even now, the slash that contained the power of &ldquo;Eraser&rdquo; was cutting through Carrera&rsquo;s left side. Carrera&rsquo;s mana circuits had been disrupted by the effects of &ldquo;Necrosis&rdquo; in several slashes to her limbs. As a result, even the assimilation of Carrera and Agera had begun to be affected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Carrera groaned, glaring at Kondou with bared teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It had been a miscalculation. She knew Kondou was strong, but she had thought she could handle him as long as she put her mind to it. However, Kondou was not that easy of an opponent. Even with the help of Agera, Kondou was still a superhuman who could surpass Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">A human&hellip; A human being!! Even if he was awakened to a Saint, I never thought that a mere human would be able to push me this far&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera contemplated her own ineptitude and put her right hand on her left side where mana was leaking out from the slash. She tried to promote recovery, but it was ineffective because her mana circuits had been messed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Normally, a wound of that magnitude could be repaired without a conscious thought. And yet, it was like this even when she was aware of it. No matter how bold and rough Carrera was, she knew that her current condition was the worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The strength of one&rsquo;s will determined one&rsquo;s strength. What&rsquo;s more, Kondou was a man who had acquired the ultimate power on his own. Compared to Carrera, who had an infinite lifespan and spent her days at will, Kondou was simply incomparable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Only now, along with the pain that tormented her, did Carrera finally understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A Skill was meaningless if it was merely given. It was only through the desire to acquire it that its essence could truly be utilized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In terms of race, physical prowess, and vitality, Carrera had the upper hand. Thanks to Agera&rsquo;s Skill, they were even on par. And yet, she was unable to win. On the contrary, they were on the verge of defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">At this rate, I&rsquo;ll lose? In other words&mdash;death? Me, the most powerful&mdash;a pillar of the primordial demons?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That was absolutely unacceptable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera&rsquo;s pride would not allow it. Above all, it would be going against the orders of Carrera&rsquo;s beloved lord, Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1 c5">If it turned out that way, it would be a big mistake that could not be redeemed even by killing herself a million times. Carrera felt fear. The inability to comply with Rimuru&rsquo;s orders had terrified Carrera, who had never before known what fear was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I absolutely will not accept that!&rdquo; Carrera shouted, glaring at Kondou with bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Forcing the wound to regenerate, she prepared herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera prayed even more deeply and intensely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A desire for victory against the man in front of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Up until now, Carrera had fought only with her own pure demonic power. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough. Those who had awakened to the ultimate level could never be reached. Just like Diablo, and just like Kondou before her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She now understood that she would never be able to defeat those who had awakened to the ultimate power. Even more so, she could never be a match for Guy Crimson, the one at the top. It was not enough just to think about increasing power. If that was the case, no matter how hard she tried, she would only end up as food for the strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera finally understood after she had been driven to this point. If one truly wanted to fight the strong, one needed to understand themselves more deeply. To do this, what she needed above all, was a strong will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was the moment when Carrera, a spiritual organism, sought the power of will, which was her essence.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;If so, let me help a little.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She felt as if she heard such a voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In that next moment, the &ldquo;something&rdquo; that had been moving deep inside of Carrera took a clearer shape. Carrera turned her attention to it. Her determination, her desire, had taken shape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Until now, it was just a force raging inside her. She had always used her power to suppress it, to control it, to use it, but now she recognized that it was also herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And she would release it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This ultimate power needed a name.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;My &ldquo;power&rdquo;, I give you a name. In order to fulfill the order Rimuru-sama has given, become my strength and release further power. Your name is the Ultimate Skill, &ldquo;Annihilation King Abaddon&rdquo;!!&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Abaddon had the meaning of destroyer. It was also the king of the abyss. A fitting title for Carrera, the &ldquo;Menace Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera had finally obtained it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The absolute &ldquo;power&rdquo; that could destroy everything.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;Ultimate Skill &ldquo;Annihilation King Abaddon&rdquo;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was the embodiment of Carrera&rsquo;s desire. A fearsome power that, once unleashed, could bring certain destruction to her adversaries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera&rsquo;s first desire for power came when she met a powerful enemy. And now that it had come to fruition, the battle between Carrera and Kondou was about to come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

From Kondou&rsquo;s point of view, this situation was nothing short of ridiculous. Kondou thought he had struck Carrera with a fatal blow on numerous occasions. And yet, no matter how many times Carrera fell, she kept getting back up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He had sliced through the barrier with his &ldquo;Remove&rdquo; power, and disrupted Carrera&rsquo;s mana circuits with a slash filled with &ldquo;Necrosis&rdquo;. After steadily accumulating damage in this way, it was the power of &ldquo;Eraser&rdquo; that was the final blow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It should have been over by now. However, even Kondou, who was in full strength, had been unable to defeat Carrera, and now she awakened her power. Kondou was keenly aware of his mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">That&rsquo;s right. If only I had a &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; bullet left&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This thought may have been due to Kondou&rsquo;s slight weakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; was a trump card. The most powerful blow that could only be created once a day. However, he had recently used it to weaken Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was uncharacteristic of Kondou to beg for something in a life-and-death battle. An enemy so powerful had gained an unknown power. Understanding this, he had fallen to a dark mood. Kondou, however, still tried to muster up the energy. Now that he was clothed in his garments, he would have to fight with an unwavering resolve. Kondou couldn&rsquo;t help but reveal his true feelings to Carrera for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You guys are unreasonable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Humans were ridiculed for being vulnerable, but that was not surprising. The species hierarchy gap between them was so wide that it was too great to be filled. Even Kondou could not help but grumble about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Upon hearing this, Carrera nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ahhh, of course. We&rsquo;re the strongest species, after all. However, I think you&rsquo;re being unreasonable too, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was Carrera&rsquo;s greatest compliment. Carrera had already recognized Kondou as her equal. That was why she respected him to the fullest and challenged him with all her might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Pointing her sword at Kondou, Carrera prepared herself with no hesitation. She activated her &ldquo;Annihilation King Abaddon&rdquo; in her right and left hands, circulating a huge force of power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The space between Kondou and Carrera overflowed with a stream of black and white light. An enormous amount of magicules was converted into energy, and the aftermath alone was enough to almost blow one away. Carrera controls all of that energy by concentrating her consciousness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you everything I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Fufu, don&rsquo;t be such a wet blanket. Now that I&rsquo;ve accepted you as an equal, I will show you my best magic!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou got a bad feeling upon hearing that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">One who did not care about the circumstances of others&mdash;that was the demon named Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Demon Lord Leon had also suffered for it, but at that time, Carrera had not been serious&mdash;she was just amusing herself. Kondou, who had to deal with a serious Carrera, would probably say that Leon had it better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Of the four &ldquo;devil lords&rdquo; including Diablo, Carrera currently had the largest amount of magicules. She had never been able to control them completely, but now that she possessed the &ldquo;Annihilation King Abaddon&rdquo;, that drawback was gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The current Carrera was able to control magic on a level comparable to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you destruction. Now be gone! &ldquo;Abyss Annihilation&rdquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was the ultimate magic that surpassed even &ldquo;Gravity Collapse.&rdquo; It was also Carrera&rsquo;s ideal, the most powerful offensive magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was a spell that generated an unimaginable torrent of extreme energy by throwing a substance called up from the abyss into a gravitational collapse force field. It went without saying that it was extremely difficult to control the energy, let alone make it directional.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was not a spell that should be used on a planet, but Carrera had no hesitation in unleashing it. It was a spell that, if mis-controlled, could wipe out even the planet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The spell had never been used successfully in the underworld, and this was the first time it had been used in the material world. With no hesitation at all, Carrera used a spell that had never succeeded before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If Testarossa and the others had been here, they would have stopped Carrera at all costs. But there was no one here who could stop Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Agera was there, but it would be unreasonable to ask him to stop Carrera. In fact, it might be better to say that it was not Kondou who was the most frightened, but rather Agera, who knew how dangerous the magic was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And what about Kondou?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He had sensed the danger just by seeing Carrera&rsquo;s preparatory movements and deployed &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo; even before he heard her announcement. This quick assessment of the situation was what made Kondou, Kondou. However, this time, his opponent was just too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsquo;Abyss Annihilation&rsquo; was an extreme magic that was presupposed upon Carrera&rsquo;s absurd mana to the point of being ridiculous. Its range was vast, and because this wasn&rsquo;t the otherworld, there was no telling how much damage it could do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou guessed that if they were not careful, it could destroy even the otherworld. If that were to happen, all of the matter in the line of fire of this spell targeting Kondou would disappear. He was aware of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If the otherworld was destroyed, Emperor Rudra was likely to be affected as well. Rudra&rsquo;s defenses were sound, but even so, there was still a chance. He had to prevent that from happening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But that wasn&rsquo;t all. Kondou was aware of a more troubling fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Judging from Carrera&rsquo;s stance, even that vicious magic was a decoy. Even if he survived the blow, it would be followed by the main attack of the sword. There was nothing he could do in that case. The only way to survive was to make every sacrifice possible and defeat her here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou made up his mind. He sheathed his sword and waited for the right moment. Then he moved just as Carrera activated the spell. With all of his might, he drew his sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yaezakura&mdash;Hakkasen&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He recreated the technique that Hakurou had shown him. The power it contained was the &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; that could only be used once a day. If he was unable to exceed his limits here, Kondou would be doomed. That was why, believing that he could do it, Kondou bet on his own potential. The power of his soul grew brighter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Would it be Kondou&rsquo;s, or Carrera&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At the very least, there was no doubt that both of them were giving it their all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou&rsquo;s blade sliced through the torrent of maniacal energy generated by the Abyss Annihilation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera&rsquo;s eyes widened, but there was a smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Pain shot through Kondou&rsquo;s entire body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even the best protection, the mythical-grade ceremonial garments, were unable to prevent the power of destruction. Yet Kondou was not daunted. With conviction, he aimed for Carrera&rsquo;s neck and made the eight flowers bloom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera, however, was a step above Kondou.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s naive. Now then, I will show you my best technique, using Agera&rsquo;s experience as my own!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Those were her words, but they were more than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In a moment of time, Carrera&rsquo;s intention was transmitted to Kondou. A hundred sword flashes that transcended Kondou&rsquo;s sword drew speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The name of the technique was the &ldquo;Oboro: Hyakka Ryouran</span><sup class="c1 c18 c5"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou&rsquo;s sword broke and shattered under the unbearable violence. Immediately afterwards, Carrera&rsquo;s final blow knocked Kondou down to his knees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou felt his strength drain from his entire body. He had passed his limit long ago. He closed his eyes and fell on his back. The end of Kondou&rsquo;s life was near.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I&rsquo;m halfway there, </span><span class="c1 c5">he laughed at himself. After all, he had been unable to do anything. Neither able to defend his country, nor keep his promise to Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;Be my friend, Tatsuya&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Ahhh, I&hellip; I was unable to keep my promise to you. </span><span class="c1 c5">Kondou&rsquo;s heart was filled with regret. The thought of his unfulfilled promise almost tore at his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;Tatsuya, I have a favor to ask you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;Anything. As your friend, I will do whatever I can to help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That&rsquo;s right, he had wanted to return the favor. He wanted to say thank you to Rudra for calling him a friend, for giving him meaning in this world. Even so, that request was too cruel, wasn&rsquo;t it&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;A long time ago, I asked Damrada for a favor. If I lose sight of my ideals, I want you, my friend, to stop me. But I have lived too long. Damrada is too kind to kill me with his own hands. I regret this terrible request I made of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;So, Tatsuya. If it came down to it, would you be able to kill me with your calm judgment? Go and get in Damrada&rsquo;s way, and stop me with your own hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">No, he hadn&rsquo;t liked it at all. Because he wanted Rudra to live, too. Rudra was calm, intelligent, and courageous. He was Kondou&rsquo;s dream, and a hard master to have. He was the man who stopped Kondou from killing himself in this world when he couldn&rsquo;t defend his country. He became his friend. The great champion, Emperor Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even so, he had still nodded because he knew Rudra&rsquo;s pain. Rudra&rsquo;s body&mdash;his shining &lsquo;soul&rsquo;, had long since reached its limit. It was probably the result of repeated reincarnations to control the special power of the Justice King Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou, with his Unique Skill &lsquo;Decipherer&rsquo;, understood this fact more deeply than anyone else. Perhaps even more than Velgrynd. She was blinded by her love for Rudra. If she knew what Rudra had asked of Damrada and Kondou, she would have been furious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In a sense, Rudra&rsquo;s request to Kondou was a natural occurrence. Now that he had acquiesced, he had to keep his promise. Because that was what a promise was. But that time was still far to come. Rudra was still alive and in control of his power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;But was that really the case?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Looking back, he had felt a small sense of unease. The occasional cold look in Rudra&rsquo;s eyes and his overly cold judgment. Kondou only knew Rudra as such, but he saw that Damrada was in distress. If Rudra was indeed alive and well, why did Damrada need to agonize over it? It was really suspicious when he thought about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Since when? </span><span class="c1 c5">Since when had Damrada really started to take action?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Did I perhaps overlook something important? </span><span class="c1 c5">He had been interfering with Damrada as ordered, but that might have been a big mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rudra was certainly a shining light when they first met. And yet, Kondou had failed to notice Rudra&rsquo;s deterioration. The moment Kondou realized this fact, he felt his mind begin to clear. It was as if the shackles of his mind had been loosened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&mdash;I see, so I was long already&hellip;at the mercy of Justice King Michael&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was shameful, he couldn&rsquo;t help but lament.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That&rsquo;s right. When Damrada was preparing to kill Rudra, he should have taken the lead instead of interfering. Then they could have stopped Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">What a blunder&hellip; </span><span class="c1 c5">Now, the situation was irreparable. It was unclear as to why Kondou had been freed from the Justice King&rsquo;s control, but he couldn&rsquo;t even move a finger anymore. All he could do now was wait quietly for death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I&rsquo;m so useless. Whether it was sharing your pain or easing your suffering, I have failed to do so. And&hellip;even the promise to free you was a failure&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The task of stopping Rudra did not seem possible by any means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As it was, he could only reach the end of his life with regret&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t go sleeping on me. Let&rsquo;s continue the fight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As if to disturb his sleep, he heard a voice speaking to him. When he opened his eyes, the enemy he had been fighting to the death with just now was peering at him sullenly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A demon with shining blond hair and a bewitching smile. Surely a beautiful sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&mdash;Don&rsquo;t be absurd. I&rsquo;m already dying. There&rsquo;s no way I can fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huh? But the victor has not been decided. That&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Heheh. It&rsquo;s not decided, huh? Yeah, sure. After all&hellip;you&rsquo;re just so, so unreasonable&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou chuckled lightly as he heard Carrera&rsquo;s words, though he didn&rsquo;t think she understood him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera herself was probably already running out of energy and on the verge of death&mdash;laughter welled up at just the thought of it. He tried to sit up, and failed. He was a mess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">After all, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do anything more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The demon in front of him, on the other hand, was free and pure&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I envy you, I really do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That&rsquo;s what he thought, from the bottom of his heart.</span><span class="c1 c2 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c5">It was also why Kondou began to say and do things that didn&rsquo;t even make full sense to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I have a request. His Majesty, with my gun &hellip;please kill&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He was going to entrust his role to Carrera, his enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">What am I doing? Making such a foolish wish to the enemy I&rsquo;ve been fighting&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A defeated man&rsquo;s wish was bound to be ridiculed. And yet, for some reason, he said it out loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera picked up the Nambu pistol that was lying on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;This? It&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">So it is</span><span class="c1 c5">, Kondou thought as his consciousness faded. He had been a little naive to think that maybe the demon would listen to his wish. Demons were not that kind. Reality was cruel, and Kondou understood that very well. His consciousness slowly became more and more distant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even though he had become a Saint, a spiritual life form, Kondou was still a human being. If his soul was destroyed, it was impossible to be revived. Carrera&rsquo;s blow had dealt a fatal blow to Kondou. He could actually feel that he was collapsing from the end. It was impossible for him to recover from this stage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmph. You&rsquo;re just going to give up now that this toy&rsquo;s broken? It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re the one who tormented me. It was such a good fight, but I happened to awaken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou hadn&rsquo;t expected such encouragement from his former enemy, Carrera. And so, Kondou squeezed the last of his energy and smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Kukuku, you&rsquo;re right&hellip; Hilarious. It&rsquo;s hilarious how pathetic I am&hellip; I know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">After these words, he began to let go of his consciousness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t die yet. I can kill the emperor if you want or whatever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so slow! What&rsquo;s the reward? It&rsquo;s common knowledge that if you want to work with a demon, you need a contract!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera was originally a demon that could never be negotiated with. And yet, somehow, she felt as if she could listen to Kondou&rsquo;s request. However, she was not willing to work for free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at Carrera&rsquo;s flustered expression. He was getting more and more amused. The demon who had been his enemy. Her embarrassed and flustered appearance soothed him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I&rsquo;ll give you everything I have&mdash;I&rsquo;ll even give you my &lsquo;soul&rsquo;, so please.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">His words could no longer be voiced out. Kondou opened his eyes with the last of his strength and looked at Carrera with a strong will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was a mockery to believe in a demon. However, with the beauty of Carrera burned into his mind, he made his wish. It may have been Kondou&rsquo;s selfish illusion to think that his message had been conveyed. Nevertheless&mdash;he bet on his last hope to save himself from his unworthiness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The voiceless voice reached Carrera.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I have heard your wish. In the name of Carrera, the Menace Lord, we have a deal! Your wish shall be granted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou smiled as he heard those words solemnly proclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He moved his weak hand with nothing but his will power and pointed it at Carrera. His fingertips touched the gun that Carrera had declared to be broken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At the touch of Kondou&rsquo;s finger, the Nambu shined golden. It was bathed in Kondou&rsquo;s power, its material changed, and it was reborn as mythical-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Kondou&rsquo;s soul was also passed on to Carrera through the pistol. However, it did not contain his heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The soul of an enlightened and sinless man could not be set free, even if his soul was bound. He would be released from the wheel of reincarnation without any restrictions and travel to the promised place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That is, liberation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera thought it was lonely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s no fun. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve had such a resolute opponent&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She muttered this to herself, and at the same time&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;In that case&mdash;Let&rsquo;s combine the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Annihilation King Abaddon&rsquo; with &lsquo;Conviction King Sandalphon&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera felt as if she heard such a voice. She hurriedly turned her attention to the pistol in her hand.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7 c19"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1 c5">The pistol glowed with an even greater dazzling golden light, as if it were silently saying, &lsquo;Now you won&rsquo;t be lonely anymore.&rsquo; It was unmistakably a memento of Kondou, and now it was Carrera&rsquo;s new partner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well then&hellip; It seems you&rsquo;re with me now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As she spoke, the pistol seemed to flicker. At the same time, she could feel power flowing into her body.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;You&rsquo;re using your mana too roughly. I&rsquo;ll help you, so you should use me more skillfully.&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She felt as if she heard Kondou&rsquo;s voice. In that next moment, she understood everything. In an instant, she had taken possession of Kondou&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Nosy guy. Can you stop treating me like a child?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The man was such a cocky bastard to the end&mdash;Carrera thought so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She didn&rsquo;t feel lonely anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Carrera stood up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Congratulations on your great victory. I, Agera, was impressed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Same to you. I&rsquo;m proud of you for surviving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Fufu, it is a pleasure to be praised by Carrera-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Although he was smiling, Agera was wounded. Carrera&rsquo;s mana had poured into his body, and he had been subjected to Kondou&rsquo;s swordplay. Now that he was no longer a sword, he was so badly injured that it was a wonder he had not been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even so, Agera was still smiling with satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;This Kondou guy, he was a descendant of your disciple, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Apparently so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Humans are not so foolish as to be underestimated. They can inherit skills and build upon them to continuously improve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Agera nodded happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;He was stronger than you, though. It&rsquo;s quite something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Agera frowned in disgust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;The only reason he was stronger than me was because he was an exception. If we had fought with swords alone, I&rsquo;m sure I would have won.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I guess you can say that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And they both laughed out loud. They were very similar in that they both hated to lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As Carrera laughed, she saw a rift in the other world that was collapsing. Through it, she could see Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s seated figure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Come now, the battle is not over yet.&rdquo; Carrera walked out with a fearless smile on her face, as she always did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Of course, I will accompany you. We will strike fear into the hearts of those who stand in our way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Agera followed behind Carrera. He was mortally wounded, but he didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The enemy was still out there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Most importantly, the promise must be fulfilled.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

He was a key player who had laid the foundations of the Empire and helped bring about a thousand years of peace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He was once praised as the &ldquo;God of War&rdquo; by the subjects of the Empire, and was a great man as recorded in the history books. Although he had now disappeared from the center stage, he was the chief of the four knights as a confidant of Emperor Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He was a warrior who had mastered all kinds of weapons and martial arts, and his physique was magnificent. Although he was over 2,000 years old, his black hair which was stroked all the way back and his short black beard gave him a youthful impression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Confronting Granit was Benimaru, the &ldquo;Flare Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The two men faced each other in the center of the circular colosseum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I am Granit. Protector of the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I am Benimaru. You can think of me as the second-in-command of Demon Lord Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">After a brief exchange of names, it was time to fight. With that in mind, Granit smiled and spoke to Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ah, wait a moment. Don&rsquo;t you wish to hear what I have to say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;It depends on the content.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s simple. I have investigated about you, and it&rsquo;s been reported that you are a very powerful man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Fufufu, I&rsquo;m not trying to flatter you. I&rsquo;ve slaughtered many powerful men and I pride myself on my discernment. Even in my eyes, you have passed the test. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re no match for any ordinary demon lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What are you trying to say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At this point, Benimaru was starting to get annoyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t like to negotiate, but now that the battle had heated up to this point, there was no time for a leisurely discussion. If the other side wanted to surrender, that would be a different story, but judging from Granit&rsquo;s behavior, that was not the case. Rather, he seemed to be suggesting that Benimaru surrender.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">His prediction was correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be so strong. I&rsquo;m surprised. Kondou was also unhelpful, as the Intelligence Bureau&rsquo;s negligence put our empire at risk. If there are more losses than expected, we won&rsquo;t be able to fight a decisive battle. So, I think we should end this now. Why don&rsquo;t you take an oath to be my subordinate? If you surrender, I will take full responsibility for you and your men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was a very self-serving proposal. Since he was about to lose, he was proposing a ceasefire without admitting defeat. From a third party&rsquo;s perspective, it would only have seemed that way. In reality, however, that was not the case. Granit did not believe that he would lose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Because they had lost a lot of battle power, he was trying to recruit Benimaru and the others in order to replenish his forces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru intuitively saw through this and felt even more annoyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">This guy&hellip;is he trying to use us as pawns? But he seems to have the ability to back up his confidence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru calmly evaluated Granit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The fact that he made that suggestion in this other world meant that he was aware of the situation inside the other gates. He should have been regarded as a warrior with a tactical perspective, not merely a guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit&rsquo;s proposal was not even worth considering from Benimaru&rsquo;s point of view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;So, my subordinates will be fine, but what about Rimuru-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, but that demon lord is dangerous. We&rsquo;ll need your help to defeat him in order to confirm your loyalty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Sure enough, Benimaru thought. He wanted them to work together to take down Rimuru, but in reality, he probably just wanted them to kill each other. Of course, if they survived that, they might be willing to let them join, but Benimaru was not stupid enough to trust such an uncertain story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Most importantly, it was absolutely outrageous to expect that he would betray Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not even worth talking about. We would never betray Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The only reason why he was still listening to the other party was because Benimaru wanted to buy some time. In fact, he had been hearing someone&rsquo;s voice since a while ago now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The voice, which sounded both nostalgic and pleasant, came to Benimaru with a proposal.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Benimaru, may I make some changes to the form of power you desire?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Normally, he would never have nodded to such a dubious proposal, but for some reason, Benimaru had agreed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Although his race had evolved into a &ldquo;flame spirit oni&rdquo;, Benimaru had not been satisfied with that. Referring to the experience of Rimuru&rsquo;s lending him the Ultimate Skill, he aimed to acquire one on his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That goal was half-accomplished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Upon seeing the battle between Rimuru and Velgrynd, and the struggles of the others, Benimaru had become enlightened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He integrated the power of fire, his forte, into his Unique Skill &lsquo;Generalissimo&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Although he was unable to recreate Rimuru&rsquo;s power of Absolute Severance, his beloved sword the Red Lotus had been reforged by Kurobee to the level of a mythical-grade sword. If he put black flames on it, he would not be defeated because of the difference in weapon performance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Generalissimo&rsquo; was on the verge of reaching the ultimate level, combining the techniques he had developed and the racial characteristics of the &lsquo;flame spirit oni&rsquo; race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And then he heard that mysterious voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru wanted to see what kind of change would come from his acceptance. That was why he agreed to talk with Granit, but later regretted it when he was told to betray Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The mere mention of such a suggestion was offensive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Having had enough, he drew his sword and held it out towards Granit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hey, come on, it&rsquo;s no good having such a short temper. A monster lives by survival of the fittest. They follow the strong and abandon the weak, right? Isn&rsquo;t it commonplace for monsters to change masters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Upon hearing Granit&rsquo;s words, Benimaru became angry enough to feel his head boil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As a general, he was confident and proud of his calm thinking, but now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Heh, I have no right to laugh at Shion like this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He mocked himself, but he had no intention of holding back his anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Enough. I have nothing more to say to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At those words, Granit shook his head and muttered, &lsquo;Good grief.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. This is a mercy and my greatest concession. I respect your position and am saying that I will hire you as a subordinate without hurting you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit spoke, seeming genuinely mystified. He had no doubt about his strength. This was because he believed himself to be overwhelmingly stronger than Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Understanding this, Benimaru became even more furious. There was only one reason why he had not yet gone off and cut him down. He wanted to make Granit regret what he had said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Are you going to continue this conversation lazily just so you can have an excuse for losing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hahaha, what a joke. I appreciate your spirit, but you should learn to have some self-awareness. Perhaps my men were too proud&hellip;and all three of them were defeated. I feel too ashamed to face His Majesty, but as long as you agree, we will have more strength than before. I&rsquo;ll be happy, and you won&rsquo;t have to die. Wouldn&rsquo;t that make for a good relationship? You should understand after hearing that. I have no intention of using you as abandoned pawns.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Obviously aware of Benimaru&rsquo;s annoyance, Granit spoke without shame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What was even more infuriating was that his words were unmistakably serious. He meant what he was saying. Granit exuded the aura of a champion, and his demeanor eloquently evoked that there was no need for gimmicks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;If you truly are a general, then think carefully. Your subordinates can be saved with just your heart. Besides, I will tell you the brutal truth. Kondou and Damrada are really strong. Damrada and I go way back, and I am familiar with his character. Well, I&rsquo;m stronger, but he is also a powerful opponent who will not be defeated even in the face of a primordial. And then there&rsquo;s Kondou. He&rsquo;s a newcomer, but he&rsquo;s just as good as us. It was only because he was too dangerous that he was put under His Majesty&rsquo;s control, but even a primordial cannot defeat him. In other words, in order to challenge His Majesty Rudra, you will have to defeat the four strongest masters, including Velgrynd-sama and myself. You understand that this is impossible, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">This guy is surprisingly loose-lipped</span><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;thought Benimaru. Now that his anger had been quenched a little, he would try to gather some information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Some of the words were irritating, but if he could find out the inner workings of the empire just by putting up with them, Benimaru had no complaints.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What bothered him was the fact that the emperor had Kondou under his control. There was no doubt that Emperor Rudra possessed some kind of domination Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that you&rsquo;ve been so vocal and unilaterally determined that we are the losers. Besides, even if we did follow you, it wouldn&rsquo;t be good to be put under control, would it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Kakaka, are you finally interested? I&rsquo;m sure you are. Well, I had heard that the ogre clan was an excellent mercenary group, so I thought that you would join us depending on the conditions. And rest assured, just as you feared, His Majesty does indeed have the power to control minds. But there&rsquo;s no point in worrying about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmm, so you&rsquo;re not convinced. Well, I guess it would be difficult. Consider it an honor to be dominated. If one is not competent, you&rsquo;ll just be ignored. Besides, Kondou was also dominated, and he was not aware of it. I am the only one who knows, so I do feel a little sorry for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;As I thought, you&rsquo;re out of your depth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was truly out of the question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit&rsquo;s point as well, was not incomprehensible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">No one would be unhappy because the controlled person would be unaware of it. That was the logic behind it, but no one would nod their head if asked to accept it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Is that so? It&rsquo;s true when I say that you don&rsquo;t need to worry. You may not believe much of what I say, but to put it another way, I can assure that you and your subordinates will never be dominated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Because you are weak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What a joke&hellip;&rdquo; Benimaru&rsquo;s anger flared up again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit&rsquo;s tone was so natural that it was completely clear that he was not bluffing or anything, and that he wasn&rsquo;t even trying to insult Benimaru. Benimaru was aware that he had evolved to become stronger, so he did not expect to be looked down upon so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well, just listen. When it comes to being an enemy, you are one of the strongest, but when it comes to being allies, you do not reach the value of being dominated. Not only have we taken control of young Yuuki as well as Kondou, but now we&rsquo;ve taken control of Veldora-sama too. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s enough room to add you to those numbers, so if you swear loyalty to me, you will be allowed to move freely. After all, even if you were to challenge me with all of your subordinates, you would be no match for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of confidence. But then again, I am confident in my own strength as well. I don&rsquo;t want to listen to any more arguments, so let&rsquo;s decide who&rsquo;s right and who&rsquo;s wrong with action.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru readied his sword, which he had slung over his shoulder. He had thought he might be able to get some useful information, but he decided that anything more would only make him more disgusted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit let out a big sigh, not amused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Monsters are incorrigible. It&rsquo;s a pity that you are still unable to see the reality of things. It&rsquo;s no use. I guess I have no choice but to give up on trying to win you over and negotiate with the one who defeated Minaza instead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru snorted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. Shion is more stubborn than I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Upon hearing this, Granit&rsquo;s face turned serious for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well&hellip;? I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve been introduced, but do you know who Minaza is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it natural to gather information on the battlefield? Rimuru-sama has also educated us to do so thoroughly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s interesting. I wonder how you got the information from the otherworld that Velgrynd-sama created. As I thought, it would be a shame to kill a man of your stature.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With that said, Granit finally drew his sword. He could handle any weapon with skill, but a familiar sword would be more comfortable in his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The moment he held his sword up to Benimaru, Granit&rsquo;s mood changed completely. His previous calm demeanor disappeared entirely, and he radiated a supreme energy that was not unlike a divine oni. His short hair was standing on end, as if he was the embodiment of a man in a furious rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;There is a saying in the otherworld, </span><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;</span><sup class="c1 c18 c5"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;The meaning is that a small boy cannot understand the thoughts of a grown man, which is exactly what you are. You should have obeyed me while I was gently guiding you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Are you still lecturing me at this point? I&rsquo;m tired of this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmph! Then die!! Hagun Gekishin Resshou</span><sup class="c1 c18 c5"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">From the first blow, Granit unleashed his most powerful special move. He was confident that this would be the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit&rsquo;s forte was analyzing the enemy. With the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; lent to him by Rudra, Granit was able to determine the combat capabilities of his opponents. By doing so, Granit was able to correctly grasp Benimaru&rsquo;s strength. That is why he was convinced that there was no way they could be defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Of course, &ldquo;enemy detection&rdquo; was not omnipotent. If the adversary had awakened to an Ultimate Skill, it was impossible to know its power. However, it was easy to guess the level of competence just by looking at the amount of magicules the adversary possessed. In this respect, Benimaru and the others were not a threat. Benimaru, Souei, Shion, and the demons. In Granit&rsquo;s eyes, it was obvious that none of them had acquired an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The &ldquo;primordials&rdquo; were a nuisance, and it was obvious that negotiations would not be possible with them. That&rsquo;s why he had planned to deal with the demons once they arrived, but it was Benimaru who appeared before Granit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In Granit&rsquo;s opinion, Benimaru was a promising young man with the potential to awaken an Ultimate Skill, however, he was not a match for Granit. The amount of magicules he possessed was huge, but it was still less than half of Granit&rsquo;s. In that sense, it was natural for him to judge that Benimaru was not a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Besides, Granit was not conceited nor careless. If the enemy was an Ultimate Skill holder, he might have had a hard time depending on the compatibility. As the battle time extended, there was the possibility of the enemy awakening the ultimate power due to perceived danger. That said, it was impossible for the power to suddenly increase just by talking with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That is why Granit intended to finish his opponent off with overwhelming power, so that the enemy would not be allowed to fight back at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Since Granit knew that Benimaru did not have a &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; like the beastmen, there was no chance for Benimaru to win. Therefore, Granit&rsquo;s victory was certain&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;How lax. You&rsquo;re not doing much for all your boastful talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Wh-What the&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Something unexpected had happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The &lsquo;Hagun Gekishin Ressho, which contained enough energy to tear Benimaru to pieces, had been deflected by Benimaru&rsquo;s sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was an unbelievable sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit&rsquo;s entire body was of mythical-grade equipment. Benimaru&rsquo;s sword was also quite good, but it should not have been able to match the strength of the true mythical-grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">No, even before that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;N-No way, no, it can&rsquo;t be!! Why&hellip;why have you acquired an Ultimate Skill&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was no wonder Granit was screaming. There was no way the enemy could have suddenly acquired an Ultimate Skill, which had never existed until now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At Granit&rsquo;s panic, Benimaru&rsquo;s attitude was calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What are you wondering about? A man is one who is constantly growing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Although Benimaru seemed fine on the surface, he was covered in cold sweat on the inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The moment that Benimaru had received Granit&rsquo;s brutal sword was the moment that he gained power. In that moment, he was able to correctly grasp Granit&rsquo;s power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If the timing had been even slightly off, Benimaru would have suffered terrible damage. While he might not have died, he was in no condition to laugh about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">That was close. I didn&rsquo;t think he was hiding his abilities to this extent&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t intend to let my guard down, but I would have lost if I hadn&rsquo;t acquired this power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It had been a good thing that he took part in Granit&rsquo;s long conversation&mdash;Benimaru thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s my turn now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru switched his mindset and concentrated on the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As far as results were concerned, it was a good thing that he had survived, but he would reflect on the rest later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The power he had just acquired was exactly the ideal he had envisioned. That was why Benimaru had performed it with the ease of breathing, and without reserve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Heat King Amaterasu&rsquo;&mdash;reflecting the information Ciel had obtained by analyzing Velgrynd&rsquo;s powers, Benimaru displayed this fearsome ultimate power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru&rsquo;s sword, the Red Lotus, adorned a black glow. It was a symbol of Benimaru&rsquo;s power&mdash;&lsquo;Amaterasu&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The word &lsquo;Amaterasu&rsquo; had two meanings in this context.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The first read as &lsquo;heat haze&rsquo; and was understood as a meteorological phenomenon. Extending from there, it became the essence of &lsquo;Formhide,&rsquo; which had no substance, could not be burned, could not be frozen, and could not be cut. The second meaning went without saying. It was the light of the sun, a super-heated flame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With his swordsmanship added to the characteristics of Amaterasu, even Benimaru could not imagine how much his power would increase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit, being Granit, responded in a manner worthy of the moniker &ldquo;God of War&rdquo;. After a moment of astonishment, he immediately calmed down and began to search for Benimaru&rsquo;s weakness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Perhaps it was because he had acquired an Ultimate Skill, but his magicule count was greatly reduced. The amount of magicules had been reduced to a third of Granit&rsquo;s, though it was still enough to make an ordinary demon lord look like a fool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The unknown power was a threat, but he judged that he could defeat it with a single blow of all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Then he shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me, you monster! This time I won&rsquo;t hold back. I&rsquo;ll use all of my strength to defeat you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In the past, Granit&rsquo;s strength had been second only to Velgrynd&rsquo;s in the Imperial Army. In fact, he was stronger than Damrada, and would have been an even match for Kondou. This was still the case today. It was simply that he had not had a chance to be serious. He was not just a guard for Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit then moved to crush Benimaru with all his might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Die, Yabugun Gekishin Ressho</span><sup class="c1 c18 c5"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was the same technique as before, but the difference in power was enormous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A fierce shockwave burst out and lightning flashed in the atmosphere. However, these attacks only passed through Benimaru. No matter the attack, it was not able to touch Amaterasu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At that moment, a roar sounded in the air. Something had happened, not in this space, but in the otherworld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Carrera makes an awful role model.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In Benimaru&rsquo;s mind, there was a clear picture of what Carrera had done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t through Moss. When he acquired the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Heat King Amaterasu&rsquo;, he was able to see visions of Rimuru and his subordinates connected by the Soul Corridor. As a result, Benimaru had also grasped Carrera&rsquo;s technique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you something special. I&rsquo;ve only just seen it myself, but I&rsquo;ll give it a go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Wha&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit was unable to react.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was because Benimaru&rsquo;s attack had already cut him into tiny pieces and burned him to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even so, the scariest thing here was Benimaru himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">His movements were just like a shimmering heat haze. The &lsquo;Heat King Amaterasu&rsquo;, which had analyzed Velgrynd&rsquo;s power, also possessed the power of &lsquo;Light and Heat Domination&rsquo; which gave him the ability to accelerate himself. By using this, Benimaru was able to unleash a sword lash of divine speed, though it was not as fast as the Scorch Dragon Cardinal Acceleration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This invincible technique, which possessed both power and speed, was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Oboro-Kokuen Hyakka Ryouran</span><sup class="c1 c18 c5"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class="c1 c5">&rsquo;. Well, I guess you can&rsquo;t hear me though.&rdquo; Benimaru said as he turned away with a refreshed look on his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Granit was actually quite strong. Moreover, he had been calculating, well prepared, and in perfect condition. Even so, the fact that he had been defeated could be summed up in one phrase&mdash;&ldquo;bad luck.&rdquo; If there was one thing to be reflected upon, it was that he had ignored the strategy of defeating the enemy when you could. Granit had died from talking too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru thought as such and made a mental note to not repeat that mistake himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

This was because Rimuru had eaten her &lsquo;Split Body.&rsquo; That Demon Lord Rimuru was one to be feared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She was unable to communicate with the eaten &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo;. Her thoughts were swallowed up in the abyss, and no response had come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even if she poured her energy into it, it would only be like throwing herself into a bottomless pit. Judging that there was no point to this, Velgrynd bit her lip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Roughly half of her total energy had been lost with no sign of recovery. It was difficult to maintain her composure, as her belief in the invincibility of &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; had now been broken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The current Velgrynd had only about 20 percent of the magicule amount compared to her perfect state. She was finding it impossible to defeat Rimuru and had to make the decision to flee this place immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Rudra&hellip; I can&rsquo;t put him in danger&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With this in mind, Velgrynd decided to abandon the protection of the gate. Fortunately, no one had attacked yet, so she left without hesitation. If someone interfered with her there, she would just take care of it while there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Sure enough, she saw a few figures at the location surrounded by the eight gates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Oh, what are you in such a hurry for? Have you forgotten something, Velgrynd-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Testarossa, who appeared to be the leader in the group, asked as she sipped her tea in a relaxed manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;White Primordial Blanc&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd glared at Testarossa whose smile only deepened. As she was in a hurry, Velgrynd was annoyed at the appearance of such a troublesome opponent. In contrast to Velgrynd, Testarossa was smiling gracefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I ask you to stop calling me that? Or&hellip;are you perhaps trying to pick a fight with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Her smile was still there, but her eyes were not happy. In the face of the overwhelmingly dominant Velgrynd, Testarossa remained unrelenting in her stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You still want to fight me even after I hurt you so badly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yes, it would be a pleasure. I don&rsquo;t need to win. I just need to buy myself some time against you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd&rsquo;s fist came at Testarossa as she stood up. Tables and chairs shattered in the shockwave. Esprit and Zonda had already evacuated to avoid being caught. Testarossa danced around lightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The heat was so intense that it could turn one into charcoal just by a mere touch, and the speed was so fast that it was impossible to see. There was no need to dare face the onslaught of Velgrynd with force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Regardless of skill-level, there was a difference of nearly ten times the amount of magicules between the two. Even though Velgrynd had only about 20 percent of her magicules left, there was still that much of a gap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And yet, Testarossa maintained a relaxed attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It would be difficult to win. That was because there was simply no way to defeat Velgrynd. But if all she wanted to do was buy time without defeating her, Testarossa&rsquo;s ability would be no problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;This is why I hate you guys!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Oh, what a shame. I have the utmost respect for you, sister of Veldora-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;So pretentious. In that case, stop making a scene and get out of my way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must decline your request. I am a competitive person and I still hate to lose. That&rsquo;s why, I&rsquo;ll get even with you right here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was Testarossa&rsquo;s true intention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She couldn&rsquo;t defeat Velgrynd in a straight fight, but she could still disrupt her. Even if she couldn&rsquo;t hold out until the other leaders arrived, Rimuru would be arriving soon. At that point, Testarossa&rsquo;s victory would be confirmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Ahhh, Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s victory was truly wonderful&mdash;playing the overwhelming Velgrynd-sama as if twisting a baby&rsquo;s hand. I, too, will not be defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rimuru had already revealed the details of Velgrynd&rsquo;s techniques, so Testarossa had no intention of letting this opportunity slip away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Red and white clashed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">One was fierce, the other was graceful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">While weaving a red and white pattern at a frightening speed, they faced each other again without making a single contact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;How stupid&hellip; You&rsquo;re not the same person you were before&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m surprised, but I&rsquo;ve also acquired an Ultimate Skill. I think it is because of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Testarossa answered casually, as if it was nothing. In fact, Testarossa had used the waiting time to hope to gain new powers. As a result, she succeeded in materializing the shape of her own heart. At that moment, she thought she heard a strange voice, but she chalked it up to her imagination. Testarossa was a demon that could choose the right answer by instinct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As for the power she desired, it was the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Death King Belial,&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Just like the Lustful King Asmodeus of Luminas, it controlled life and death. However, the fact that it weighed more on the side of death must have been reflective of Testarossa&rsquo;s true nature. For her, defeat was a humiliation she could never accept, much less death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">One of the conditions for a demon to evolve was to accumulate power to the limit and then age for more than 2,000 years. It also meant that they could not be defeated even once&mdash;in this case, defeat meant annihilation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The phenomenon of losing one&rsquo;s body and being returned to hell was what was called defeat. So, strictly speaking, a &lsquo;draw&rsquo; did not count as a defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Escape, however, was another matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A mental organism was influenced by their own mind. The moment one admitted that they could not beat their opponent and stopped challenging them, they were defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There were some crazy demons in the world, like Diablo, who were truly undefeated, but those were few and far between. Testarossa was aware of only a handful of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As long as your heart does not give in, it&rsquo;s okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That is why Testarossa did not stop challenging Zegion. As long as she did not stop until she won, it was not a defeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The same was true in this case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Testarossa believed that as long as she didn&rsquo;t run away from Velgrynd, she would eventually win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve acquired an Ultimate Skill, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yes. Diablo&rsquo;s bragging was annoying after all, but it was also because the previous battle made me deeply aware of what I lack. As long as a Skill is a reflection of the heart, they are not necessary&mdash;that is what I once thought, but I guess it was a shallow belief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been able to confront my own desires, but I feel as if I&rsquo;ve sharpened my use of power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd also possessed the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo;, so she understood the meaning of Testarossa&rsquo;s words. It was also why she realized that it would be even more difficult for her to withdraw from this place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Truly, so abominable&hellip;&rdquo; Testarossa laughed at her unintentional complaint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That is the best kind of compliment, is it not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And just as Velgrynd&rsquo;s anger was about to reach its peak, there was a massive explosion that distorted space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd, who had regained her senses, looked back in surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">One of the gates had been blown apart in a spectacular fashion. The blond-haired demon, Carrera, appeared there. Incidentally, some of Leon&rsquo;s infamy was due to Carrera&rsquo;s actions, but that was not the point right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hey, it looks like you made it. I don&rsquo;t like losing all the time either, so I&rsquo;d like to join you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ufufufufu, no, Carrera. I don&rsquo;t mean to be mean, but you&rsquo;re covered in scars.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That Kondou guy was tough. Well, I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied, so I think I&rsquo;ll let it go for today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Laughing, Carrera wobbled, and Esprit rushed over to support her to a chair which Zonda had maneuvered. Agera was also there, but he was left alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;If Carrera will put up with it, I&rsquo;ll stop being so selfish. I&rsquo;m a little tired, so I&rsquo;ll just watch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Before she knew it, Ultima was sitting next to Carrera. She noticed that Veyron had prepared a chair for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">One after another, the demons gathered. Of course, it didn&rsquo;t stop there. Shion, Souei, and Benimaru also emerged from their respective gates. Upon seeing this, Velgrynd could only cringe. She realized that the strongest men on her side had all been defeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was a tactical victory for Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rudra and Velgrynd&rsquo;s hopes were about to be crushed.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

In the midst of all this, Laplace was running towards Kagali, accompanied by Vega.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It appeared that the forbidden spell, &lsquo;Birthday&rsquo;, was long over. To be more precise, Kagali must have lost control due to the loss of Velgrynd&rsquo;s assistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It wasn&rsquo;t clear how many undead elves had been created, but there should still be some time before they started to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Depending on the will of the undead elf, they could become a powerful warrior from birth. That&rsquo;s why it was necessary to take them into custody before anyone else did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Since Laplace had thought as much, others would naturally come to a similar conclusion. Lieutenant Kondou, who had led the ritual, could not have been unaware of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Damn, I thought I had a head start.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Once Laplace arrived at the site, the Imperial soldiers were in the midst of loading Kagali and the others into military vehicles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re Laplace then. I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re quite strong, so is a fight inevitable?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The man who called out to Laplace was a gentleman wearing a different colored military uniform. Lieutenant Kondou&rsquo;s white uniform was conspicuous, but this man&rsquo;s bright red uniform gave off a strange air. And yet, he did not look very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He had a doll-like face and was a mysterious man whose gender-neutral looks could be of a man or a woman. He seemed ordinary, and if he wasn&rsquo;t wearing such a flashy military uniform, he wouldn&rsquo;t even have left an impression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;No, perhaps it was because of the military uniform that the man did not leave an impression. Observing this, Laplace responded cautiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Laplace, and if yer willing to let &lsquo;em go, there&rsquo;s no need to fight, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huhuhu, that&rsquo;s an impossible proposition. You see, the war is still going on over there. I can&rsquo;t just run away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The man was determined. In that case, Laplace had no choice but to prepare for battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Then so be it. So who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It would be a profitable question if answered properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Me? Well, it&rsquo;s only natural that you don&rsquo;t know. I am the tenth in the ranks. I, Feldway, am the one who holds up the history of the empire!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The man Feldway. He was a permanent fixture in the Empire and was expected to serve as a spare in the unlikely event that there was a vacancy in the Single Digits. He had heard rumors about Laplace as well, but this was the first time he had seen him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s you. Then yer the man they call the spare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a man. But I&rsquo;m not a woman either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s complicated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Laplace looked at Feldway as they spoke. He looked natural, and not self-conscious. He didn&rsquo;t take a stance, and he didn&rsquo;t appear to be running away. He was an elusive figure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was Vega who was impatient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Leave it to me. I&rsquo;ll crush that bastard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Laplace hurriedly stopped him as he tried to move forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Wait a minute, I told you never to run ahead! The Chairman and the others are basically being held hostage, so we can&rsquo;t mess with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Footman and Teare were still alive and well, struggling against the masses. If they were called upon, it would be impossible to tell how the battle would turn out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Laplace cautiously tried to find out what his opponent would do. However, this was interrupted by the appearance of an unexpected person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Vega, come help me. Laplace is a traitor. I&rsquo;ll deal with him here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;Wha-?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Feeling a strong killing intent, Laplace fled from the scene. The voice that reached his ears was that of his trusted boss, Yuuki Kagurazaka. However, what he heard was not what Laplace wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Boss, come to your senses! It&rsquo;s not like you to be manipulated by others!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Yuuki had defied Mariabell&rsquo;s control. With his mental strength, he should be able to resist any kind of mental control. However, Laplace&rsquo;s voice did not reach him. Yuuki attacked Laplace with unhindered movements. Seeing this, Vega, who had been confused, smiled a twisted grin of happiness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Oh, yeah, boss! When you&rsquo;re done with him, I can eat him, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yeah, sure. I welcome you to get stronger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boss, you know what you&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Following the strong. That&rsquo;s the kind of man Vega was. He lacked morals and ethics. He lived by instinct more than a wild animal. That is why he did not feel his betrayal was evil, and gleefully launched his attack on Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If it had only been one of Yuuki or Vega, he could have dealt with them. However, dealing with both of them at the same time was a tough task even for Laplace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Che, this isn&rsquo;t good. Let alone saving the Chairman, I might get killed. Nope, I&rsquo;ll just have to leave for now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">From a strategic point of view, Laplace made the correct choice. But that was not going to happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huhuhu, there&rsquo;s no point in trying to escape. You&rsquo;re Laplace, aren&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re cunning and cautious. It would be troublesome to let you go, so I&rsquo;ll have you die here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">True to those words, Laplace&rsquo;s transition failed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was the result of Feldway&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; of the entire battle area, which he had been observing from up high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Vega shot a turbulent volley of energy bombs in time with a violent kick from Yuuki. Vega may be a muscle head, but he had a good sense of combat. The escape route was blocked, and Laplace&rsquo;s chances of winning were slim. No, rather, as long as Yuuki was there, there was no chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Geez, is this the end for me&mdash;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even so, Laplace had no intention of giving up so easily. Betting on the slight possibility that Yuuki&rsquo;s mental domination would be broken, he decided to show the true power he had been hiding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You fool! Yer the one who&rsquo;s gonna die!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In between Yuuki&rsquo;s attacks, he kicked Vega, who had carelessly approached him. This made Vega unable to even stand up for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s pretty good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m not as good as the boss, but I&rsquo;m pretty strong too, y&rsquo;know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I know. So, at the least, I&rsquo;ll kill you with my own hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;Wha?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With a small sense of discomfort. Laplace noticed something and hurriedly stared at Yuuki&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Sure enough, it was a familiar face&hellip; He was caught off guard. Lost in thought, Laplace was too late to react to Yuuki&rsquo;s fist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Oh no</span><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;he was screaming in his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And yet&hellip;the pain never came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;Because right before Laplace&rsquo;s eyes, Yuuki&rsquo;s fist had been blocked by someone&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Oh dear, Rimuru-sama has scolded me. That is your fault, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">What do you mean by that?&mdash;</span><span class="c1 c5">Laplace couldn&rsquo;t help but want to retort, but he restrained himself from doing so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;D-Diablo-san. Did you come to save me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huh? Why would I&mdash;uh, that&rsquo;s right. It was Laplace, right? I am here to help you, so make sure you tell Rimuru-sama emphatically that I saved you.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Diablo&rsquo;s expression changed from disgusted to smiling brightly as he said so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I&rsquo;ve never seen such a suspicious smile before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was quite impressive that Diablo could be seen this way by the admittedly suspicious Laplace, who had a reputation for such smiles. Needless to say, it was not a compliment at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Okay, I get it. I&rsquo;ll tell Rimuru-sama that Diablo-san has been a great help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Good! Then I will help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In fact, Diablo had just been told by Rimuru, </span><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;What are you still doing here?&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;With everyone else working hard, it was only natural that he would be reprimanded as the only one watching Rimuru&rsquo;s battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Although Diablo had a good reason for being there to protect Rimuru, he could not say such words to him, who seemed to have completely forgotten his orders. Rimuru was the only one in the world who could swing around the selfish Diablo. This was the moment that proved it once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That is why Diablo was ordered to get to work and ran away. After he heard the report from Moss, he rushed to this location. He did not come to help Laplace, but rather to get rid of all the suspicious people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Kufufufufu. It was fortunate that I was able to sell a favor to this man here. Now, Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s opinion of me will be restored.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Diablo felt as if he had already won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ll leave Yuuki over there alone because of the alliance&hellip;huh? Isn&rsquo;t this the Phantom King? I know you&rsquo;ve been coveting this world for a while, but is this the case? You&rsquo;ve teamed up with Rudra, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Diablo&rsquo;s gaze rested on Feldway, who had been smiling faintly. The smile faded and he looked at Diablo with a blank expression as he took in his appearance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;So then you must be the Black King Noir? Kondou&rsquo;s investigation mentioned that the primordial black had become a servant of the Demon Lord Rimuru, so I see that it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I now go by the name Diablo. I don&rsquo;t care about what you plan to do, but if you try to interfere with Rimuru-sama, I will not tolerate it. If you are planning to antagonize me, be prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;How kind of you! You are always getting in the way, you damned demon!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Feldway glared at Diablo with an intense hatred. His murderous intent alone would have been enough to kill a normal person instantly. However, Diablo was unfazed, and he sneered at Feldway as if to provoke him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Never mind then. Even if I were to fight you here, I have no chance of winning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Rest assured. It will be impossible to win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">After a brief exchange of glares, Feldway spoke first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I think I will retire for the day. If you ever try to interfere with me again, be prepared for that, Diablo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmm. Well, I&rsquo;ll let you off the hook for remembering my name. But keep in mind, I will prepare the means to kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">After those words, they glared at each other again. Then, as if having nothing more to do, they moved on, ignoring one another&rsquo;s presence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Feldway gave orders to Kagali and Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about His Majesty Rudra. We&rsquo;re returning to the flagship, so get ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In response, Yuuki, who had been watching over the situation, disengaged from his battle stance. Vega stood up unsteadily and followed Yuuki towards Kagali and the others. Footman and Teare were also called back, and with Feldway&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo;, everyone, including the newly born undead elves, were transferred out of the location. Diablo remained there, communicating with Moss. Now that he knew that the enemy was the Phantom King Feldway, he decided that he was the only one who could fight him. He moved to clean up the mess, albeit reluctantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With Footman and Teare retreating, the fight on the battlefield came to an end. After confirming that everyone was safe, he gave appropriate instructions on how to treat the wounded. Moss was not only competent but also in contact with Benimaru. Diablo decided that his work here was done. After Feldway and the others had disappeared, he flew to the flagship by transport.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Laplace was the only one left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What, so yer leaving me alone again&hellip;?&rdquo; He muttered to himself and slumped his shoulders.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><h2 class="c30"><span class="c14 c22 c17 c32">Epilogue</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c13">Brother and Sister</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1 c5">After &ldquo;eating&rdquo; Velgrynd, I calmed down. Now that I had some time to look around, I took a look around the battleground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The Jura forest was badly damaged, but the capital city of Rimuru had escaped destruction. The area around the city had been cleared and some damage had been done, but Geld and his men seemed to have kept it safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I was relieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;So, what are you still doing here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it fine, Rimuru-sama? In fact, I am here to make sure no one gets in Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I had noticed that he had been watching ME the entire time I was Velgrynd. To be honest, it was annoying, but I didn&rsquo;t have time to pay attention at the time. And now, here we are at the present. It was only natural that I would complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Come on, everyone else is working hard. So you go do your job.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;?! Ah, I-I understand&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">After looking at me with sad eyes, Diablo left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This guy, I really can&rsquo;t figure out how he thinks.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;He must have been watching the battle under the guise of guarding the Rimuru-sama and to prevent any external interventions&mdash;frankly, it was unnecessary.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It seems that even Ciel-san was tired of Diablo. Her words were more scathing than ever. In any case, now I could get back to dealing with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I decided to leave all the explaining and convincing to Veldora, however&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;As I listened, I found out that Veldora was putting all of the blame onto me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Oi oi, how come it&rsquo;s always me who has to deal with all these problem children?!</span><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;I was annoyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This guy seems to be trying to portray me as the bad guy so that he could deflect Velgrynd&rsquo;s anger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;Anyway, that&rsquo;s why I wanted to tell my sister that I was safe, but Rimuru wouldn&rsquo;t let me. Now that you are in the same position, you will understand what I am saying, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;And just like that he was selling me out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He&rsquo;s like that spoiled child who blames his friends when he doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to get angry at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was a mistake to let Veldora do the persuasion. But he had a point. I could understand that it would be embarrassing for him to show up out of nowhere in front of his sister, who was furious thinking he was dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I could understand that feeling, but what&rsquo;s all this about blaming me? Isn&rsquo;t that just forcing more trouble on me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He was supposed to help mediate, not make the situation worse for me. A-Ah, this is no good! I can&rsquo;t leave Veldora in charge any longer. I needed to explain that Velgrynd&rsquo;s current position was the same as Veldora&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Before that, I have something to report.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What is it?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Upon analyzing Velgrynd, I have discovered that she was under the control of someone, possibly Rudra. I can remove that effect if you want. How do you want to proceed?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">H-hey, that&rsquo;s a bombshell of a statement!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I&rsquo;m not sure how to respond to that report. I had thought Ciel-san would have done the &lsquo;Analyze and Assess&rsquo; on Velgrynd, so I was not too surprised about that, but I just couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet after hearing that Velgrynd had been controlled. By the way, was Rudra really the culprit?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Almost confirmed. In addition, I have observed the battle between Carrera and Tatsuya Kondou through the Soul Corridor and it seems that Kondou was also controlled by Rudra. I would guess that this is a similar situation.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">When I asked for the details, I was told that Granit, the guy Benimaru was fighting, even gave him those answers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That guy was an idiot. I think it was necessary to make it a good example for everyone to learn. That said, it was a problem to be solved after I returned home. The current problem at hand was what to do with Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It has been proven that Veldora is unreliable. That&rsquo;s why I was going to explain it to her, but if Rudra&rsquo;s Mental Control is affecting her, there is a big possibility that she won&rsquo;t listen to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Now then, what to do&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Since we&rsquo;ve taken the trouble, how about we put Velgrynd in the same position as Veldora?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Huh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Does that mean you can connect me to Velgrynd with Soul Corridor like Veldora, and turn her into an Ultimate Skill?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Is that even possible?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;No problem. The current Rimuru-sama is equal to or greater than the True Dragon race and has plenty of magicules. It is possible to take in Velgrynd.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But if I do that, I might be taking away Velgrynd&rsquo;s free will&hellip;or would I?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I was unable to actually force Veldora to do anything. When I asked him for a favor, he had to agree to work with me. Rather, Veldora just does whatever he wants. When he wants to protect himself, he is willing to sell me out, as he is doing right now. Although I would have sentenced him to confiscation of snacks at such a time, when I think about it, he really does give me a hard time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even if he did something detrimental to me, it was impossible to undo his released state. I suppose I could stop the energy supply, but I couldn&rsquo;t make Veldora disappear. Moreover, the amount of magicules that a True Dragon had was so large that it could not be lost by mere chance. As long as Veldora did not return of his own accord, he was free to do whatever he liked. In other words, there was no coercive force. Basically, when Veldora was free, I couldn&rsquo;t force him to do anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Thinking about it this way, I realized that Velgrynd would be in the same situation. If I put her in the same position as Veldora, and then &lsquo;free&rsquo; Velgrynd, it would be a quick way to prove my innocence. I wouldn&rsquo;t be misunderstood any more, and I wouldn&rsquo;t get caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Sibling quarrels? I don&rsquo;t know anything. That kind of thing is not my area of expertise. In that case, let&rsquo;s put her in the same state as Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;If you&rsquo;re not sure, do you want to put some restrictions on Velgrynd?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Hmmm? Restrictions, is that even possible&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Putting restrictions on Velgrynd so that she can&rsquo;t resist may be necessary for the future. But&hellip;that went against my principles. Worst of all, if Velgrynd was not convinced, it would have been better to leave her in Isolation in Imaginary Space. If I put a mandatory condition on her, I would become the same as Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even if she doesn&rsquo;t want to help me, that&rsquo;s fine. As long as she promises to stay out of my way, she can go live her life.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Understood. I think that&rsquo;s only fitting for Rimuru-sama.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The plan was set. And it was time to get to work. First, I would start with a greeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ah, Velgrynd-san. How are you&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You, Rimuru?! Quit messing around! Let me out of here now!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I turned my attention into my &lsquo;Imaginary Space&rsquo;, and Velgrynd began to rampage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If you pictured the scene, it would be like a suspicious slime approaching a beautiful woman. Indeed, quite the criminal. That slime was me&mdash;er, now in human form. No, this was&hellip; It was now a beautiful girl of about 16 years old who was approaching a beautiful woman. The atmosphere was rather bewitching, but it couldn&rsquo;t be helped. This was also to prove my innocence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In the image, I held out my hand to Velgrynd. Then I ate Rudra&rsquo;s influence, released it, and established the &lsquo;Soul Corridor.&rsquo; There were doors on both sides, so unless Velgrynd opened her heart, she could not communicate with me. I could talk to her, so I didn&rsquo;t think it was a waste of time. These tasks were completed without any problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd, who had been rampaging, had quieted down, and I was surprised by the sudden change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ri-Rimuru? You didn&rsquo;t do something unscrupulous to my sister, did you&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You idiot! Of course not! In fact, if you had persuaded her properly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to go through all this trouble!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">We were about to start a fight, but then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There was a sudden loud cry and Veldora and I lowered our heads at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">To be honest, I was scared. No wonder Veldora found her so difficult to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What the hell is the meaning of this, Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Even if you ask, I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I had no idea what she was talking about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I can hear my Split Body&rsquo;s voice over there, but these sounds don&rsquo;t seem to reach there. What the hell did you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">A very pretty woman looked into my face, and I got nervous. I could feel her breath on my face and I began to feel faint. She smelled really good. Velgrynd&rsquo;s breath was so sweetly fragrant, perhaps because she didn&rsquo;t normally need to breathe.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Now is not the time. Velgrynd&rsquo;s doubts were probably due to the fact that she has been freed from Rudra&rsquo;s control.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Are you a little angry?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;It&rsquo;s just your imagination.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Is that so?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But, well, I decided not to pursue it too deeply, and got an explanation from Ciel-san. According to it, the story was simple. The Velgrynd in front of me was not under Rudra&rsquo;s control while the &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; over there was. That&rsquo;s why I was using the Infinite Prison to block the flow of information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">When blocking out information, one can only get information from the other side. As a result, the Velgrynd on the other side was in a trapped state. Under Rudra&rsquo;s control, she still couldn&rsquo;t understand what I was thinking. It was a one-way street.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I understood that Ciel-san was doing amazing things, but I was no longer surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;In other words, if we analyze the difference in consciousness, we can prove that you were being controlled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;As expected of Rimuru. Sister, let&rsquo;s trust Rimuru here&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yes!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1 c5">Veldora, who had interjected, was being disciplined again and secretly, I did feel a little happy to see that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">After shouting at Veldora, Velgrynd seemed to be thinking about something. She was probably trying to figure out the difference between what I said and the &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; over there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I, too, looked through the eyes of my companions and grasped the situation on the flagship. The battle was in its final stages. And something had just happened that would confirm Velgrynd&rsquo;s suspicions.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

This may have seemed a bit cowardly, but that was only for those who were not familiar with the situation. In reality, even if Velgrynd was in a weakened state, it would be difficult to win even if they all challenged her at once. Be that as it may, the foreign space created by Velgrynd was torn apart and about to collapse. Just when I thought it was about to collapse, Diablo came and destroyed it with ease.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;The Black Primordial&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Diablo. He&rsquo;d be pretty capable if I wasn&rsquo;t watching.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! That guy gives me his snacks. I like him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This guy has been bought off. So I can&rsquo;t believe every compliment that Veldora showers on Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With that in mind, as I watched the situation, I saw Velgrynd take a step back to protect Rudra. Rudra remained in his chair with a relaxed attitude despite the situation. That was some nerve. Or was it confidence? Seeing Rudra like this, there was one person who moved first. Carrera. With the golden pistol in her hand, she shot Rudra without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Moreover, that bullet&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the move that weakened me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&lsquo;Judgment&rsquo;. If Kondou can only shoot the strongest bullet once a day, how can the Yellow Primordial&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I knew the details because Ciel-san had told me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Not the Yellow Primordial, but Carrera. Apparently, she won the battle against Kondou and was entrusted with defeating Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect even Kondou&hellip;&rdquo; muttered Velgrynd after I explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Leaving the confused Velgrynd behind, the situation moved on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsaquo;Rudra!&rsaquo; shouted the other Velgrynd, she stood in front of Rudra with her arms outstretched as if to protect him. The fact that she was able to reach Rudra in time with a bullet of divine speed showed that her physical abilities were monstrous. However, the &lsquo;Judgment&rsquo; was not half as powerful. Upon hitting, it blew off Velgrynd&rsquo;s right arm from the shoulder and hit Rudra without diminishing its power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Surprisingly, Rudra was unharmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">His expression was relaxed, as if he had known that Carrera&rsquo;s attack would be in vain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What was that? How was he able to neutralize that attack?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I saw a glimpse of the &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo;, but I don&rsquo;t believe it was capable of completely nullifying it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Veldora and I were surprised by the sight. Velgrynd couldn&rsquo;t believe it either, muttering, </span><span class="c1 c2 c5">&ldquo;Why&hellip;?&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;as she collapsed to the ground supported herself with both hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Sister?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd replied in a small voice to the panicked Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Your friend was right. I really was under Rudra&rsquo;s control&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Realizing this, Velgrynd told me about Rudra. She said that Rudra was safe because of his ironclad defense. That defense was absolute and could not be destroyed by anybody no matter what. However, there was a condition. The loyalty of the subjects and subordinates to the emperor was the source of energy, and there had to be people who were loyal to the Emperor. And then there was a drawback. Although this defense was perfect and always active, it restricted all other actions while it was active while it was active. This ability was the pride of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As we could see from the fact that it had deflected Carrera&rsquo;s Judgment, it was almost invincible. The Skill&rsquo;s user could not attack while it was in use, but those matters could be left to his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;If he had that kind of power, he wouldn&rsquo;t have needed my sister to protect him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Yes, I thought so too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Velgrynd answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the right thing for me to do would have been to pretend to protect him and then go on the offensive. But the fact that I acted like that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd finally understood that she was being &lsquo;thought guided&rsquo; when she saw herself pushing to defend Rudra. And Rudra, on the other hand, maintained the absolute &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; and did not make a move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That&rsquo;s how it was supposed to&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Velgrynd shouted in surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And we were all in shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was because Rudra had instantly released the &lsquo;Castle Guard&rsquo; and pierced through Velgrynd&rsquo;s chest even as she rushed towards him upon losing her right arm. It was as if Rudra had deliberately attacked Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I see, so that&rsquo;s how it is&hellip;that person, my beloved Rudra, is gone&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Tears spilled from Velgrynd&rsquo;s eyes. As if to prove Velgrynd&rsquo;s sorrowful words, Rudra laughed loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hahahahaha! Velgrynd, you should be honored to be of service to me. I&rsquo;ll put your power to good use.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As soon as Rudra said that, Velgrynd on the other side crouched down in pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Yuuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Steal Life&rsquo;, isn&rsquo;t it? Rudra&mdash;no, the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; also has the ability to freely use the Skills of the targets under his control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What? That should be illegal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Upon hearing Velgrynd&rsquo;s explanation, Veldora and I looked at each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to deal with Rudra!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid! I have no need to argue that I am the best, but I don&rsquo;t want any trouble, so forgive me for refusing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you a parfait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tempting, but&hellip;Hnnng.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd looked at us in disgust as we squabbled. Perhaps that was why her tears seemed to have receded. Needless to say, I thought it was a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Well, that and&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">About the Rudra who had taken Velgrynd&rsquo;s power&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;Rudra is Justice King Michael&rsquo;?&rdquo; I had an idea, but I asked that question since I wanted to hear it from Velgrynd herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Rudra was already at his limit. He had been reincarnated so many times that his soul was worn out. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s Rudra yet not Rudra. He was replaced by the &lsquo;Justice King&rsquo; long ago.&rdquo; Velgrynd replied sadly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;No, no, no, a Skill born of the master&rsquo;s desire cannot harm the master himself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. Rudra&rsquo;s &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; was a power given to him by Veldanava. The Skill actually earned by Rudra by his own will was &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;. Now that Veldanava, our brother, has still not returned, it is lost and unaccounted for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I have it though?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It wasn&rsquo;t the right atmosphere to say that, so I decided to just keep quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd continued with her explanation. To sum it up, she said that Rudra&rsquo;s repeated reincarnations had weakened his soul&rsquo;s power, and that he had become unable to control the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">When I heard about this, it came to my mind that rather than a Skill betraying its host, this could be seen in a different way.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Indeed. If I were in the same position as the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;, I would aim for the revival of my true Master, even if I had to take control of the temporary host.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That&rsquo;s what I thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I felt that Ciel, as a Manas, would never give up, no matter how impossible the challenge might be. That is why I couldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; help but understand the thoughts of &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">However, that didn&rsquo;t mean&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be left unattended. The &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; has probably evolved into a free-willed Manas. If that&rsquo;s the case, then its purpose of action must be completely different from what Rudra was aiming for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Manas? What the hell is&hellip; I mean, wait, wait! Rimuru, do you think that the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; is after something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Since I was asked, I would answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the resurrection of Veldanava? I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s willing to make all kinds of sacrifices to achieve that goal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&lsquo;So, we can&rsquo;t just leave it alone there&rsquo;, I explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd&rsquo;s face paled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At that moment, a new figure appeared and launched an attack on Velgrynd, who was currently facing Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;That is Phantom King Feldway, isn&rsquo;t it? He was overlooked because it was decided that Diablo could not defeat him, but it seems that he left his friends behind and came back.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c1 c5">If Diablo couldn&rsquo;t defeat him, he must be a very strong man. Still, it always felt like Diablo just wanted to slack off, or was it just my imagination?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Never mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Feldway, just like a powerful foe, was attacking Velgrynd with &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; which was difficult for even an awakened demon lord to resist. The wounded and weakened Velgrynd did not seem to have the strength left to resist it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Fuhahahaha! That Velgrynd has disappeared from this world through Space-Time Transfer!! Now, there are only two True Dragons left. It&rsquo;s a good start, Rudra&mdash;No, Michael-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Feldway called Rudra &ldquo;Michael&rdquo; again. It seemed that Velgrynd&rsquo;s guess had been proven true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Despite the suddenness of the event, Benimaru and Diablo tried to react quickly. However, I hurriedly performed a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; and stopped them. It was partly because Phantom King Feldway was unfathomable, but also because I wanted to see how Rudra would react to being called Michael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What&rsquo;s more&mdash;I could see it. I could see a strange substance slipping out of Rudra&rsquo;s body. It was clinging to Velgrynd as if it was trying to protect itself. And now, it seemed that all of that strange substance had disappeared from Rudra&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Really, this reaction is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmm, not bad. Velgrynd&rsquo;s power became an afterthought, and Rudra disappeared. Now all we have to do is harness the power of Veldora and Velzard and his resurrection will be complete.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rudra, who was now called Michael, accepted this as a matter of course. Now it was confirmed. My enemy was not Rudra, but Michael. And his goal was the complete revival of Veldanava, the Star King Dragon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;This is a good thing, Michael-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmm. Velzard can be dealt with, but it&rsquo;s Veldora that&rsquo;s troublesome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And so their conversation continued. It was as if they didn&rsquo;t care about Benimaru and the others. But that was to be expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Shion and Testarossa, who were not stopped, attacked simultaneously, but all of their attacks were blocked by the Castle Guard. Naturally, Feldway was also unharmed since he was protected as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">How very troublesome. But that wasn&rsquo;t the point right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Rudra, th-that&rsquo;s Rudra, right? The fragments&mdash;the pieces of his soul are still there!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I thought I was the only one who could see it, but Velgrynd seems to have sensed it too. I had wondered if she could see them, but it appeared that Velgrynd was planning to track down what was left of Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Calm down&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Shut up! If we don&rsquo;t get over there soon, the pieces are going to disappear!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was like she had become a spoiled child, crying and screaming despite her angry expression. I prolonged the time by using &lsquo;Thought Acceleration&rsquo;. Then, Velgrynd and I created our own world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Calm down, please. If you go out now, you&rsquo;ll just end up under Rudra&rsquo;s control again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;But!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I&rsquo;m sure you know what you&rsquo;re doing. But beyond that, you&rsquo;ll be stuck there. With no guarantee of returning to this world, saving Rudra is a pipe dream. Perhaps it&rsquo;s even impossible.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;If you continue to act like this, you&rsquo;ll have no future.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Shut up! So&hellip;what do you want me to do? I can&rsquo;t give up on Rudra like this, I can&rsquo;t!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Those were Velgrynd&rsquo;s true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was Ciel&rsquo;s voice, not mine, but she hadn&rsquo;t noticed it and had exploded with a passion.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;The possibility is still there.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;Wha?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;If you accept my &lsquo;Skill Alteration&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was a sweet temptation. It was no longer even necessary to wait for the answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I accept. As long as it makes my wish come true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It seemed only natural to me that Velgrynd should answer that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The moment Velgrynd agreed, a voice echoed out.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Velgrynd&rsquo;s will has been confirmed. The first thing to do is cut off the interference with &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">As she listened, Velgrynd calmed down. She examined her own body deeply, guided by the voice, and found that she had indeed found it. There were traces of some kind of interference with the &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo; engraved deep in her heart. It was blocked now, but it was definitely dangerous to leave it there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">So this was the cause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd also understood. At the same time, she remembered. The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; had a counterpart to the Regalia Dominion. It was a memory she remembered hearing a long time ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Among the powers created by Veldanava, the ones more pure were called the angelic system, and all of them were subject to the absolute control of the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo;. This was the &lsquo;Ultimate Dominion&rsquo;. Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo; was no exception. A very narrow corridor had been constructed to connect it to Justice King Michael, and there was no escaping its influence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">That&rsquo;s right, how could I have forgotten? The Ultimate Skill holders of the angelic lineage could not go against my brother. He hated it more than anyone else, and that&rsquo;s why he traded Rudra&rsquo;s &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It also made sense why she had been dominated. If her brother Veldanava had built the system, it would be nearly impossible for her to resist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Indeed, I have no future&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rimuru was right, Velgrynd felt like crying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But then&hellip; Just as Velgrynd was about to give up, she heard a strange voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;The preparations for the &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo; have been completed. It will be integrated with the no-longer-needed &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Huh?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd almost screamed. It was only natural that she would act this way. The &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; that she and Rudra had been looking for was found in such a place. Or rather, Velgrynd had just now noticed. The voice she had been hearing was not Rimuru&rsquo;s. It was not a simple auditory hallucination, but a clear and powerful voice of will. It was very similar to the &lsquo;Voice of the World&rsquo;, but softer and more refined, with a feeling of tenderness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There were many things she wanted to ask, but what she needed to ask now was the meaning of its words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait! You&rsquo;re giving me the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;? Or rather, what do you mean by &lsquo;integrated&rsquo;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;If you have no choice but to follow the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; as it is, then you can stop the alteration. I found a control circuit in the Covenant King Uriel, so I decided to use it as an inspiration to create a new Skill just for you while discarding it.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That was absurd. It was seriously an answer that anyone would spit-take on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But all Velgrynd cared about was one question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;If you do that, then I can go find Rudra, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Yes, that is possible.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">If it was possible, then there was no need to hesitate. Velgrynd agreed with hope in her heart. No, it had already been promised.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Velgrynd, your intentions have been confirmed, so there is no need for a second acceptance. I will now activate &lsquo;Skill Alteration&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That voice&mdash;Ciel had no intention of stopping. The moment Ciel activated &lsquo;Skill Alteration&rsquo;, an unbelievable surge of power rushed through Velgrynd&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Then, it gently enveloped her entire body.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;Scorch Dragon Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo; and &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; will be integrated and evolved into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Divine Flame King Cthugha&rsquo;&hellip; Successful.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">In a fantastical and solemn voice, Ciel announced in high spirits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And in that moment, Velgrynd was freed from all bondage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Just as I was nodding my head to Ciel&rsquo;s words, my &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; was transferred out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was my fault for giving permission, but needless to say, I was stunned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; had been the culmination of the bonds I had with my comrades&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&laquo;No problem. What was integrated into &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo; was merely the residue of &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;. Its essence has been inherited by the new power of &lsquo;Harvest King Shub-Niggurath&rsquo;.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&mdash;Eh?!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I have so many questions. I have a feeling that Ciel-sensei is up to a lot of great things without my knowledge. I was too afraid to ask, but the thing I needed to focus on now was Velgrynd. I was glad to hear she made it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Congratulations, Velgrynd-san. Now it&rsquo;s safe to let you out.&rdquo; When I said this with a smile, she glared at me with a fierce expression. It wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t have an idea why, so I gently looked away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;There are many, many things I really want to ask you, but not now. So, are you going to let me go now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I nodded because there no longer seemed to be a problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Ciel said that giving Velgrynd the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; had made her responsive to Rudra&rsquo;s soul, so finding and retrieving the soul fragments would no longer be impossible. When I heard that, I thought to myself. Perhaps the residue that Ciel was referring to was the core of Rudra&rsquo;s heart, the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo;. If so, then Velgrynd had always been with Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I wasn&rsquo;t sure if one could find Rudra&rsquo;s soul, which was scattered all over the world, but I had a feeling that Velgrynd would be able to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s &lsquo;release&rsquo; you for now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And just like that, the three of us came back from the spiritual world to the present world. We said our goodbyes, still feeling the lingering of time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Thank you, Rimuru. I&rsquo;m sorry for all the trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It really was. There was so much I wanted to complain about too! However, I was afraid of upsetting her, so I kept quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;re connected by the Parallel Existence, I don&rsquo;t think you have to worry about getting lost. I know it&rsquo;s going to be difficult after that, but good luck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I kept my support to a safe level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Sister, even if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, I&rsquo;m here! So, don&rsquo;t be sad and just do your best!&rdquo; Veldora said with a big smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">His ability to say anything no matter the atmosphere was very impressive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It seems that Velgrynd was not sure how to react to this. And her answer was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You really are an idiot. Stupid, stupid, cute little brother. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With that said, Velgrynd smiled shyly. Then, for some reason, she stared at me again. Being seen super close by beautiful women made me too nervous to move a muscle. Seeing my deer-in-headlights expression, she shook her head in exasperation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And with that, Velgrynd departed with a valiant &lsquo;Transport.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.67px; height: 22.67px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, light

The attack on Michael was still going on. It was not good enough to get through the Castle Guard, but it was still the right thing to do. This was because the moment you stop attacking, the enemy would start their own. It was also why Benimaru and Diablo were watching from the sidelines instead of stopping Shion and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There were only two enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I was tempted to take them down here, but unfortunately that was not possible because as long as the Castle Guard was in place, an attack on Michael would not work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But then again, the conditions are the same for everyone&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Fuhahahaha! How weak. Your attacks won&rsquo;t work against Michael-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Feldway, smiling broadly, was trying to activate his powers in between the attacks. It seems that the Phantom King was not exaggerating, and he intended to throw all of my companions out into the void at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Goodbye, everyone. I doubt we&rsquo;ll be seeing each other again, but&mdash;what?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I was also aiming for the moment the attack went off. In order to interrupt Feldway, I appeared on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Demon Lord Rimuru&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Nice to meet you.

I don&rsquo;t want to hear that from Aggressor-san, who&rsquo;s always longed to be in the city.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">When I provoked him further, his expression became a blank mask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I guess he was the type who didn&rsquo;t get riled up and accumulated his anger calmly. They were the most troublesome type of opponent to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At that moment, Michael, who had been silently listening to our conversation, intervened in a relaxed manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Huhuhu, weren&rsquo;t you hiding and observing me? I thought you were looking for a way to sacrifice your friends and escape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He was more than half correct, but I wasn&rsquo;t about to sacrifice my friends. Well, whatever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you think. Let&rsquo;s just get this over with, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Hmph, you&rsquo;re a bold man, but do you really think you can beat me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Who knows? But I&rsquo;ll give you some advice. I understand that your authority is absolute control over the Angelic Skills, and that one cannot break through the Castle Guard as long as there are people who believe in you. There&rsquo;s no more to say. Don&rsquo;t you think that if we turn the empire into a scorched earth and kill every last living thing, you would lose your advantage?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">This was complete bluffing. I had no intention of going that far. However, if I had to weigh the sacrifices of my comrades to this, I would do it without hesitation. I was already prepared for it a long time ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;It seems I have underestimated you too. Should we not be enemies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Noble ideals and noble missions have nothing to do with me. I can actually sympathize with some of your goals. That&rsquo;s why, as long as you don&rsquo;t interfere with me, you can do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Although it was too late now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Now that Michael had gone out of control, he would no doubt bring us calamity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">It was still okay for now, but Ciel predicted that there would inevitably be conflicts of interest in the future. In that case, all I had to do was believe it and act accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Michael was silent, perhaps pondering. In that case, I decided to tell him my intentions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;If you try to hurt me or my people, I will crush you so badly that you&rsquo;ll never be able to do anything foolish again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I would strike fear into their hearts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Indeed, I certainly had no way to break the Castle Guard currently. However, I did have my trusty sidekick Ciel. I knew it would find a way to defeat it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">What&rsquo;s more&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I would show no mercy to those who laid a hand on my precious friends. I would defeat Michael no matter what it took&mdash;I swore to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;I see. Then let&rsquo;s leave for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;&mdash;Nn?! Is that all right with you, Michael-sama?&rdquo; Feldway asked in surprise, but Michael nodded humbly, indicating his intention to withdraw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to tell, and we are the same. If we fight here, it&rsquo;s going to end badly for both of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With the means I just mentioned, it was indeed possible to win. But that also went against my principles. I could not deny that I was postponing the problem, but for now, I really just wanted to buy time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well then, I guess we&rsquo;re done for today. Shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;All right. Having said that&hellip;on a day that we should have been celebrating our complete resurrection, we&rsquo;ve been given an unexpected challenge. I had thought that Guy Crimson would be the biggest obstacle, but it turns out that this slime, whom I thought was insignificant, is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With that said, Michael and Feldway left. They probably weren&rsquo;t going to the Empire. There was no response to my surveillance spell, Argus. And Moss reported nothing unusual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;How awful, really. I don&rsquo;t even know where they went.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Benimaru laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;But Rimuru-sama, as you ordered, everyone is safe. Now let&rsquo;s celebrate that and go home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I suppose that&rsquo;s correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s go home! I&rsquo;m already tired today and quite hungry. Why don&rsquo;t we ask Shuna to prepare some delicious meals for us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;A banquet, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That also sounded good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">I nodded back at Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home and have a banquet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">My words put the smiles back on everyone&rsquo;s faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Even though we still had much work to do, we were grateful that we could celebrate our success together.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11 c7"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 30.27px; height: 30.27px;"><img alt="A picture containing drawing, knot

Yesterday, today, and tomorrow. She tirelessly moved forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">At that time, she had left Rimuru and flew to a different world that transcended time. It was in an unknown crevice of another world where she safely reunited with her &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo;, which had managed to escape Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That place had no atmosphere or even earth, Velgrynd was forced to drift around without any sense of time. Had Velgrynd not been a True Dragon, she might have died in that place. But she had &lsquo;Spatial Domination&rsquo; and an infinite lifespan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She had plenty of time to think before she reached the place where she could stop. Velgrynd had almost stopped thinking because of the unbelievable events that had happened to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">The amount of information exceeded her processing capacity. The emergency of being adrift in a different space, on the other hand, allowed her to regain her composure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd thought to herself. The sheer volume of information and its anomalies had made her give up thinking, but she thought for as long as she could. Then, more than anything else, she thought of one thing. The fundamental question was how Velgrynd had been able to regain her freedom, going against the system constructed by her own brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">There was only one person she could think of who could have made this possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That aberration of a slime, an ally of her foolish brother&mdash;Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">N-No way, it can&rsquo;t be?! That slime&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">He had freely altered an Ultimate Skill, giving Velgrynd her freedom and greatly improving her abilities to an even higher level. This was not something that could be done by someone normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Only my brother Veldanava could do such a thing. If there was another being capable of such an act, I can&rsquo;t imagine it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd shuddered at the thought of the impossible. Turning her attention to it, the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Divine Flame King Cthugha&rsquo; reacted. It was far more powerful than the &lsquo;Charity King Raguel&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And above all, as if linked to Rudra&rsquo;s heartbeat, the fragments she had taken in were reacting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Heh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who that slime is. He is Rimuru, a friend and ally of Veldora, and my benefactor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">That was the conclusion she came to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Finally, Velgrynd broke out of her circling thoughts and turned her attention to reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Traveling across the worlds, and through the ages, Velgrynd continued to collect pieces of Ruda&rsquo;s &lsquo;soul&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">I love you. I love you, Rudra!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">With the single-minded desire to see Rudra again, Velgrynd overcame countless obstacles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And then, finally&hellip; She spotted the boy in a big city full of skyscrapers.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1128.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Rejoice and resolve. The boy was in possession of everything that was missing. If she gave him that, adding in the rest of what Velgrynd had&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">However, Velgrynd struggled with the question of whether she could do such a thing. To do so would be to dramatically change the boy&rsquo;s fate. Velgrynd, who had an infinite lifespan, was perfectly capable of staying here and watching over the boy until his lifespan came to an end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2 c5">Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to panic about. I want to see you as soon as possible, but I mustn&rsquo;t be in a rush.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">Velgrynd thought as such and was about to turn her back on the boy and walk away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">But then, a shining soul fragment flew to the boy of its own accord. Unseen by anyone, the soul fragment merged with the boy as if it had been sucked in. And with that impact, the boy vanished from this world. All that remained in Velgrynd&rsquo;s hand was the fragment of the beginning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Perhaps, you too? Have you been wanting to see me?&rdquo; Velgrynd asked the fragment as if speaking to it and hoped that it was so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5">She activated her &lsquo;Divine Flame King Cthugha&rsquo; to follow the boy&rsquo;s lead.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><h2 class="c30" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c32 c14 c22 c17">Afterword</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m happy to announce the release of volume 15.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last time, I overshot the deadline, and I may or may not remember saying that I would be careful, but unfortunately, I overshot the deadline by about ten days this time, too.

I was rushing inwardly at the time. This volume has the largest number of characters in the series, and some of them are new to the series. I know that I&rsquo;m ignoring the theory, but I&rsquo;ve decided that it can&rsquo;t be helped.
