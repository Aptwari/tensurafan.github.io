It hasn’t even been a year since he first appeared in this world, just out of the blue, yet the name <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was now renowned throughout the Western Nations. He’s become a celebrity known to all.</p>
<p id="line_31"><em>How did this happen?</em></p>
<p id="line_32">He felt puzzled from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p id="line_33"><em>How did things end up like this?</em></p>
<p id="line_34">In order to explain, we must go back one year in time.</p>
<p id="line_35">………</p>
<p id="line_36">……</p>
<p id="line_37">…</p>
<p id="line_38"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was on his way home from school with several friends, when suddenly, he laid eyes on an unbelievable sight, a nordic maiden with lustrous blue hair and skin fairer than that of any model or celebrity. Even from afar, the vibrant hues of her hair still managed to catch his eye. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had never once laid his eyes on such a beauty, one who could make everyone she passed by do a double-take.</p>
<p id="line_39">“Hey, check out that babe—”</p>
<p id="line_40"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> called out to his friends with the frankness of any male high schooler. But—there was no response. <em>Hmm, </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought to himself as he turned around—only to find himself in front of the scenery of an unfamiliar street.</p>
<p id="line_41">“—W-wha?”</p>
<p id="line_42">His mind couldn’t help but go blank as he froze at the spot.</p>
<p id="line_43"><em>S-sensei! I don’t know what’s going on!</em></p>
<p id="line_44">Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t care too much about the civic tutor that was his sensei, but in this situation, it was all his heart could ask for. But his prayers proved to be futile… <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was at an impasse.</p>
<p id="line_45"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sat by the water fountain at the town square, at a complete loss for what to do. As time trickled by, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> finally began to regain some of his composure. After all, worrying about it wouldn’t fix the problem. He resolved to give his current situation some thought, retracing his steps to figure out where it all went wrong.</p>
<p id="line_46">Now that he thought about it, that woman was quite suspicious too. For all her dazzle, strangely enough no one else noticed her. Although he had no rational basis for that conclusion, he had a gut feeling that that was the case. But now she was gone. No matter where <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked, he couldn’t spot her again. She was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p id="line_47"><em>In times like these, isn’t the beautiful girl who started the whole thing supposed to tag along? Speaking of which, ehh? Is this really not some kind of a prank? Have I really just been transported to something like an isekai?</em></p>
<p id="line_48">In a normal Isekai plot he’d at least have someone who had some inkling of what was going on come with him as well. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to be quite that fortunate.</p>
<p id="line_49">The sun was about to set, and minus the school lunch that he had earlier, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was running on an empty stomach. It didn’t take a genius to figure out that he was starving.</p>
<p id="line_50"><em>Wait a minute</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought to himself seriously. <em>At least this is a town</em>. He was lucky enough to have not spawned in some forest or in front of a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But given how things had developed, it was still too much for him to take in.</p>
<p id="line_51"><em>Normally under this type of circumstance, shouldn’t there be a king or someone like that waiting for me in order to explain the whole ordeal, or at least help me start off?</em></p>
<p id="line_52">But alas, those were simply web novel fantasies found in the stories that he and his friends used to passionately discuss, he complained to himself. Reality was cruel, and sitting there sighing wasn’t going to offer him any solutions, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was once again forced to reevaluate his situation.</p>
<p id="line_53">His name was Honjou <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Age 16. First year student at a renowned high school.</p>
<p id="line_54">Although unrelated to the current topic, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had plans to make changes to his appearance after high school. In addition to tailoring his uniform, he had also dyed his hair.</p>
<p id="line_55">He was quite the handsome lad, likely due to his Russian heritage. His mother was also a beauty, to which he guessed was the source of his good looks.</p>
<p id="line_56">While it was nothing significant, dying his hair blonde had made him stand out. As a result, he was quite popular in school. While in truth he wasn’t remarkable in any way, people nonetheless treated him differently.</p>
<p id="line_57">In addition, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had some secret hobbies—watching anime and reading manga. He never really showed it at school, but in reality, he was actually a closet otaku. And so he wasn’t really fazed in spite of the bizarre predicament he had found himself in… As <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pondered, he checked the pockets of his uniform and rummaged through the contents in his backpack.</p>
<p id="line_58">There was a wallet in his pocket. In it were one Yukichi-sama (A ten-thousand yen note), three Noguchi-san (Three one thousand yen notes), and some change.</p>
<p id="line_59">As for his textbooks—he stowed them all away in the desk and locker at school. Given this to be the case, all he had in his backpack right now were the magazine he had just bought, a smart phone, and gum. In other words, his act of clearing items from his backpack for the convenience of transportation had inadvertently caused him more trouble.</p>
<p id="line_60"><em>Sigh. Had I known things would’ve turned out this way, I woulda prepared a bit more… </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lamented.</p>
<p id="line_61">He had an apocalypse-kit for emergency situations. If he had brought it with him, he could have lasted for at least three days.</p>
<p id="line_62"><em>At the very least, I shoulda brought a swiss army knife</em>. Perhaps that thought could have reassured him a little. Although he had no clue what to do with a single knife anyway.</p>
<p id="line_63">All in all, he had nothing useful at hand.</p>
<p id="line_64">If anything, perhaps the gum counted as something. He picked up the gum and put it in his mouth. At the very least it could help ease the gnawing hunger in his stomach.</p>
<p id="line_65">And now, the only useful item he had was gone. A truly sad predicament.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_66">Although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was able to get by for a couple hours, one thing became very apparent: he couldn’t understand what anyone was saying, meaning that the language of this world was nothing like that of his original world. Even begging for food would be a difficult task in and of itself.</p>
<p id="line_67"><em>This is just way too much… I can’t continue like this. Worst-case scenario, I can use my phone and backpack as bargaining chips for food—</em></p>
<p id="line_68">Steeling himself, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stood up from the fountain.</p>
<p id="line_69">Although he did not quite understand the laws and customs of this world, he came to the conclusion that the best course of action would be to find a public institution to seek asylum.</p>
<p id="line_70">Before that however, he had to figure out a way to sustain a living—in other words, to somehow obtain food.</p>
<p id="line_71"><em>Not being able to communicate with people sucks.</em></p>
<p id="line_72">And at this rate, he was definitely going to starve to death.</p>
<p id="line_73">He might still be able to get water, but getting food, on the other hand, would prove no easy feat. Although he didn’t wish to resort to such desperate measures, he had to see if there were any leftovers for him to salvage.</p>
<p id="line_74">The best places to search, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> deduced, would be areas with high food traffic, such as grocery stores and restaurants.</p>
<p id="line_75">He had cast away any semblance of dignity that he once had over the course of just a mere couple of hours. That’s the type of flexibility <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has as a man.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_76">After walking for a few minutes, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> successfully made his way to the town’s banquet hall. He had no other reason to come here other than the enticement of food.</p>
<p id="line_77"><em>Now I just gotta negotiate with them. Ask them if they’d let me work here… Ah crap… That’s not gonna happen. I don’t even know their language…</em></p>
<p id="line_78">The language barrier was insurmountable.</p>
<p id="line_79">As someone who has read plenty of Isekai fiction, for god knows what reason, the protagonists always seemed capable of communicating with the Otherworlders. Looking back on it now, he realized just how lucky having that ability would be.</p>
<p id="line_80"><em>I don’t expect to become some OP powerhouse, but ahhh, at least spare me on the language—</em></p>
<p id="line_81">But regardless of how much he complained internally, no one would answer him.</p>
<p id="line_82">Mustering his resolve, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made to push open the door.</p>
<p id="line_83">Before he could do that, however, the door was suddenly pushed open from the inside. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ears were assaulted by the din of numerous chattering voices from the inside of the store.</p>
<p id="line_84">“?!”</p>
<p id="line_85">Startled, he took a step back. He felt a soft sensation in his chest. The person coming out was a cute, petite lady, but her expression was a bit timid.</p>
<p id="line_86"><em>Eh? Don’t tell me I’ve got caught up in some trouble…?</em></p>
<p id="line_87"><em>No way</em>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought. But his prediction unfortunately came true.</p>
<p id="line_88">“OxA…!”</p>
<p id="line_89">The woman in front of him blurted out a bunch of words that sounded like complete gibberish to him. However, despite his complete ignorance, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> flashed a warm, caring smile and nodded in response. Upon seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s expression, the woman quickly regained her composure. Her cheeks were flushed bright red as she drunkenly stared at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_90">It would’ve been wonderful if things had just ended there, but of course, once again <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> got handed the short end of the stick.</p>
<p id="line_91">A fierce-looking man barreled his way out. His target: the woman asking for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s help.</p>
<p id="line_92"><em>Agh, if I slip up, I might just be a goner…</em></p>
<p id="line_93"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had a very good reason to believe so.</p>
<p id="line_94">Although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> himself stood over 170cm tall, the huge man in front towered over him by at least one whole head. The man’s face was dyed a crimson red as if he were drunk. He was also armed, a longsword strapped about his waist.</p>

<p id="line_102">«Confirmed. Under the effects of ‘Chosen One,’ language mastery…successful. Subsequently, ‘Heroic Spirit’ and ‘Heroic Coercion’ have been activated.»</p>

<p id="line_104"><em>—What? What happened…</em></p>
<p id="line_105">While his head was swimming with doubts, given his current situation, he had no time to worry about any of that.</p>
<p id="line_106">“Oi oi, what’cha doin’ buddy??? Yer’ ain’t tryin’ to get in my way, are ya?”</p>
<p id="line_107">He could suddenly understand what the large man was saying thanks to the effects of the Unique Skill ‘Chosen One’ that had just awakened within him. However, that was no cause for celebration.</p>
<p id="line_108">What was more important was figuring out a way to get out of the pickle he found himself in. One wrong move and it might be game over.</p>
<p id="line_109"><em>No, Little ol’ me doesn’t plan on that AT ALL</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had planned to drop on his knees and apologize.

<p id="line_110">“That’s right! This person here promised he’d save me!”</p>
<p id="line_111">“—Ho ho?”</p>
<p id="line_112">Veins popped on the large man’s temple. He bulged out his muscles, exuding an aura of pure strength.</p>
<p id="line_113"><em>Oh, he doesn’t even need to use his sword. I’ll be done for if he just smacks me down…</em></p>
<p id="line_114">Despite being overwhelmed with sheer terror, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was able to think calmly.

<p id="line_116">The commotion attracted a crowd as passersby, along with the people from the surrounding shops, came to check out the ruckus.</p>

<p id="line_119">“That bastard Jinrai… After failing the B-rank exam, his temper’s been flaring up. Even Katya refused to serve him, knowing that.”</p>

<p id="line_121">“Ah, there’s no time for chit chat now. If an adventurer ends up killing civilians in town, it’s gonna be a huge problem. Quick, someone contact the guild!”</p>
<p id="line_122">“Someone’s done that already. Moreover, rather than just talking, why don’t you go stop him?”</p>
<p id="line_123">“What nonsense are you on about? Jinrai might only be ranked C-plus on paper, but his strength surpasses even B Rank! The only reason why he didn’t make it was due to inappropriate conduct during the test, but his strength is the real deal. That’s not someone I can take on—!”</p>
<p id="line_124">The people bantering were likely colleagues of Jinrai.</p>
<p id="line_125">Overhearing their conversation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s heart filled with a mixture of both hope and despair.</p>
<p id="line_126">They seemed to have sent someone to inform some guild. Cavalry was on the way as long as he could stall for some time. However, without knowing when the rescue would arrive, and with the surrounding people not willing to help, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was left to fend for himself. That was the equivalent of a death sentence.</p>

Considering the outcome, he had only himself to blame.</p>
<p id="line_129">“You made up your mind yet?”</p>
<p id="line_130"><em>Definitely not.</em></p>

<p id="line_132">At the very least, he was going to go out in style.</p>
<p id="line_133">He didn’t mean to become an edgy delinquent when he changed his hairstyle during high school. He merely dyed his hair for the sake of it and had absolutely zero combat experience.

<p id="line_134">With that being said, talk-no-jutsu was his best bet as of now.</p>
<p id="line_135">“The weakest dog barks the loudest. Have YOU made up your mind? How dare you come bothering me?!”</p>

He threw out bluffs left and right in a desperate attempt to save his hide. Best case scenario, he got to stall for some time. Even if he couldn’t, he might still get lucky and escape with only getting beaten to a pulp. If he weren’t quite so fortunate, he’d be dead meat.</p>
<p id="line_137">He was frozen with fear just a moment ago. Now, however, his feet had stopped shaking…</p>
<p id="line_138">“…We got a badass here. Sure, then I won’t hold back.”</p>
<p id="line_139">Jinrai glared at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with a devious smile. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> immediately regretted his decision upon seeing the bloodthirsty look on Jinrai’s face.</p>
<p id="line_140"><em>I can try to slip away now—oh yeah, there’s a girl called Katya behind me…</em></p>
<p id="line_141">“Can I ask you to leave for a moment?”</p>
<p id="line_142">“Alright!” Katya responded with enthusiasm. “That guy has been ogling at me like a pervert for quite some time. Please teach him a lesson, big bro!”</p>
<p id="line_143"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> only told Katya to stand aside so he could plan an escape. Katya probably thought that she would get in the way of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s fight. She left him to his own devices just as she was told, slipping back into the crowd.</p>
<p id="line_144"><em>…Ugh. No matter what I do, I’m already surrounded by people.

<p id="line_145">“Hehe!”</p>
<p id="line_146">Jinrai’s smile deepened.</p>
<p id="line_147">With how things had developed, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had to utilize his last resort.

As a matter of fact, his escape plan was quite despicable. He intended to spit out his gum to startle his opponent, which quite frankly didn’t sound anything close to being heroic at all.</p>
<p id="line_154">Yet all those concerns were of the past. There had been a new development.</p>
<p id="line_155">“—Woah, su-such an oppressive aura…who are you really…?!”</p>
<p id="line_156">Jinrai, who was brimming with confidence just moments ago, was now covered in cold sweat.</p>

He thought chewing gum would calm himself down, but all it did was further intimidate Jinrai.</p>
<p id="line_158">“Ugh, what type of weird sorcery is this?! It doesn’t matter who you are! Just watch as I slaughter you!”</p>
<p id="line_159">After his declaration, Jinrai immediately set himself upon <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_160">As for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he was caught completely off guard.</p>
<p id="line_161">“?”</p>
<p id="line_162">Confused, Jinrai froze on the spot. He then took a step forward with the intent of striking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> down. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gawked dumbly at Jinrai’s giant fist slowly approaching him right in front of his eyes.</p>

<p id="line_164">Yet the worst-case scenario that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> imagined did not happen. Pain began to set in, but it was only limited to a small part of his forehead. He opened his eyes, full of surprise and fear.

<p id="line_165">“Eh?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> mumbled in confusion.</p>

<p id="line_169">“Unbelievable! Did you catch his movement just now?”</p>

<p id="line_171">“Just who the hell is this kid—?” the bystanders murmured amongst themselves.</p>
<p id="line_172">In reality, this was the result of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Unique Skill ‘Chosen One’ being activated.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_178">As a matter of fact, this was an especially rare Skill even among the Unique Skills.

<p id="line_222"><em>He’s been through a lot more than me…</em></p>
<p id="line_223">Realizing this, he felt that he shouldn’t be the one tearing up right now. It gave him a sense of encouragement and inspired him to keep on fighting.</p>

<p id="line_228">“Oh yeah, Bonnie here also used magic to learn the language.”</p>
<p id="line_229">It seemed that the young man named Bonnie also relied on magic to talk to people. He was a graduate of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Academy and an “Otherworlder” under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s protection.

That’s when magic came in handy, and ever since then, Bonnie became obsessed with magic, hoping to study at the academy. He became an adventurer rather recently, and he was looking for companions. It just so happened that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party came along at that time.</p>

<p id="line_232">Although Jinrai was ranked C-plus, his strength was comparable to that of a Rank B. With the additional aid of Bonnie’s magic, they were able to safely handle any quest they attempted.</p>

Under the effects of this Skill, his companions were able to perform beyond their actual capabilities. Jinrai could display strength beyond even Rank A. With the additional buff that increased their dodge chance, they were practically invincible.</p>
<p id="line_234">And so, the “Chosen one” was utilized to its fullest.</p>
<p id="line_235">It was such an amazing Skill to him.</p>

<p id="line_260">They had uncovered evidence of a massive slave trade market operating in Balakia, one of the small nations surrounding the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom. There was a lucky slave who managed to escape and subsequently called for help, which made it necessary to dispatch an investigation.</p>
<p id="line_261">There was a chance that the whole nation might be involved, however small the possibility. The estimated threat level was above rank B-plus, which would prove no easy feat even for the most seasoned of adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_262">“Personally, I wanted to refuse, but I couldn’t defy the sponsor’s request.

Even if this leads to war, our strength alone would be enough to topple such a small nation!” Jinrai proclaimed with a strong sense of justice. Ever since his defeat against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, his personality had changed, becoming so heroic that he only vaguely resembled his past self.</p>
<p id="line_268">“He’s right. Slaves in this day and age, that is unforgivable.

<p id="line_269">Bonnie was neither famous nor well known, despite being an “Otherworlder” and possessing a Unique Skill.

<p id="line_271">So naturally, his words became the deciding factor this time as well.</p>

<p id="line_288">The person who was speaking with Count Braver grabbed a sword that was placed on the wall and suddenly stabbed the count.

<p id="line_290">Jinrai, who stood at his side, stared at the soldiers who came swarming together.</p>

If you were to compare the credibility of Marquis Gossel, who was a prominent figure of the country, to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, then the former would be higher.</p>
<p id="line_302">That explained Marquis Gossel’s lax attitude, and why Jinrai was anxious.</p>
<p id="line_303">However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t too worried. Although he had a ton of complaints about this whole ordeal, he realized that this flow of events was something he had become accustomed to.</p>
<p id="line_304">Unique Skill, ‘Chosen One’ was a terrifying Skill that always guided the situation towards <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> coming out as a hero.</p>
<p id="line_305">This time proved to be no different.</p>
<p id="line_306">Observers who came to see the commotion could see the faces of the Balakia Kingdom’s nobles and guests from other nations.</p>
<p id="line_307">At first Marquis Gossel glanced at them, brimming with confidence, but his face quickly distorted with dismay.</p>

We’ll treat him since he’s still alive.”</p>
<p id="line_310">Jiu had suddenly come running and had cast a healing spell on Count Braver, and then turned to look at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, fishing for some praise.</p>

If we were to make an honest testimony it’ll end with you getting punished for the slave trade. However, if you decide to keep hiding it—you’ll probably just end up getting eliminated by that guy there. So, how do you wanna do this?”</p>
<p id="line_312">The reality of the situation struck Marquis Gossel as he heard those words come out of Jinrai’s mouth, who had a cunning smile on his face.</p>
<p id="line_313">Apparently taking in the whole situation and realizing that there was no escape, he decided to give up. Count Braver confessed everything right on the spot with his head hung low.</p>
<p id="line_314">“What happened? What is all this for?”</p>
<p id="line_315">And as if right on cue, the King of Balakia appeared.</p>
<p id="line_316">Even the clamoring of the nobles was silenced in the presence of the king, and the situation settled. It was as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had expected. After that, the situation rapidly developed.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_317">The dispatched military police secured evidence of the slave trade by searching Count Braver and Marquis Gossel’s residences. With that evidence, they were able to uncover the surprising fact that Marquis Gossel was one of the chiefs of an illegal organization. But it didn’t end there, it was also discovered that the main base of the illegal organization was within Balakia.</p>
<p id="line_318">The nation took this situation seriously. The illegal organization ‘Orthrus (Slave Trade Union),’ that had been a thorn in the side of the Western Nations, had its headquarters in Balakia. This was a problem that the kingdom just couldn’t sweep aside.</p>
<p id="line_319">Slaves weren’t the only product that Orthrus had either. Their offerings of weapons, shields, suspicious potions, drugs, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and trinkets from magic items to artifacts were widely spread.</p>
<p id="line_320">It was something to be expected from this kind of organization, but it wasn’t something a small country could handle.

<p id="line_321">Needless to say, that was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party.</p>
<p id="line_322">Being used to something happening was a scary mindset to have, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still expected things to play out like this.</p>
<p id="line_323"><em>Ah, so it really did end up like this again…</em> Yet he had still accepted Balakia Kingdom’s request.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_324">Following that—</p>

<p id="line_326">Combined with Balakia’s royal army, it was over 2,000 men, and with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> heading the group, everyone in it went under the effects of ‘Heroic Act’ and were able to obtain skills beyond their previous abilities.</p>
<p id="line_327">Orthrus’s headquarters had hundreds of members as well, among them were bruisers who could be considered equal to A rank, and the captured <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were no less dangerous.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_366">Even after the Reception Ceremony, my schedule was fully booked.</p>
<p id="line_367">This time we had to greet these distinguished guests. The representatives of each country were currently arriving one after another.</p>
<p id="line_368">I heard that the early arrivals had already stayed here all week. Not only the people who received my invitations were showing up, but also merchants who merely heard rumors of the festival, making the town quite lively.

The prominent figures and royalty of other nations seemed intrigued by the unfamiliar novelties and sights on display in our country.</p>
<p id="line_369">Seeing all that, our plan of making this land into a tourist destination appeared to be going well.</p>
<p id="line_370">That being said, the maximum number of nobles we could accommodate in this city was around 3,000. In regard to the common folk, we had enough facilities to take in up to 10,000, but we only had a few for the upper class.</p>
<p id="line_371">The cost of providing meals, lodging and entertainment for the nobility was significantly different than the cost of providing for the common people. Considering the fact that these facilities were used by aristocrats, there had been a thorough investment in security as well. Therefore, an ample amount of living space was reserved.</p>
<p id="line_372">We were exclusively accepting royalty and nobility this time, meaning we declined normal customers even when they offered a large sum of money. It seemed that there were also several business tycoons visiting, so I was worried that there would be complaints concerning that policy when receiving them.</p>

<p id="line_389">And as such, I was able to greet the royals and nobles from the Western Nations without a hitch.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_390">While this was going on, the King of Blumund had come looking for me. As always, he looked like a pleasant man, like someone straight from a fairytale. A young-looking queen stood at his side. Although I didn’t know her actual age, it was said that it had been 20 years since their marriage. They might not have looked like a good match at first glance, but in truth, it was said that they were adored by the people of Blumund for being love birds.</p>
<p id="line_391">“I apologize for taking so long to show my gratitude. Appeasing the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nobles Marquis Müller and Earl Hermann, as well as prompting the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the Western Saints Church to make a move, was highly beneficial to our country.”</p>
<p id="line_392">It was thanks to this man’s consent that Fuze was able to act freely. My plans were able to succeed because he followed the contract. Their efforts in spreading beneficial news about us is the cause of my current reputation not being a poor one. Seeing the steady increase in the number of merchants coming to our country, it outlined to me just how significant Blumund Kingdom’s influence really was.</p>
<p id="line_393">As I was showing my gratitude, the King of Blumund shook my hand with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_394">“You’re welcome, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono,” he said with a hint of reluctance, “this isn’t something to be thanked for. All I did was abide by an agreement with another nation. And you also heard from Fuze, right? I put all my bets on you. Our luck, I placed it in this country. And of course, there are also reasons for profit in those bets, so you don’t have to thank me.”</p>
<p id="line_395">Although he had the smile of a good man, he was someone not to be careless against—that was the King of Blumund.</p>
<p id="line_396">He had straight up claimed that the reasons for helping our country were because of profit and that we didn’t need to thank him, with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_397">“But still, I’m happy that you trusted us.”</p>
<p id="line_398">It is important to express gratitude.</p>
<p id="line_399">I didn’t plan to continue pestering him, but I expressed my gratitude, nonetheless.</p>
<p id="line_400">After hearing that, the King let out a bitter smile while saying: “I can’t help but wonder whether you really are a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_401">After that, his expression changed, looking me straight in the eyes, and he told me: “I heard this time that Kazak from our county has caused you trouble. It’s a relief that your people were rescued.”</p>
<p id="line_402">He was talking about the case of Viscount Kazak. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bore the brunt of that incident, and about the nasty things they did in the Great Forest of Jura, that happened before I rose to power as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_403">However, a sliver of responsibility could possibly still be pinned on the kingdom of Blumund. Even when all the fault squarely fell on Viscount Kazak.</p>
<p id="line_404">Ultimately, he was just playing a small role in the whole debacle; even if his personality was the worst, he never <em>personally</em> did anything.</p>
<p id="line_405">Be that as it may, a crime was a crime. Moreover, Kazak allegedly said something along the lines of ‘Do whatever you want with those lowly <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but there is no reason for me to be punished!!’</p>
<p id="line_406">Innocence would be an absurdity.</p>
<p id="line_407">“As long as the problem has been taken care of safely, we have no plans to make it an issue.”</p>
<p id="line_408">“That, I’m thankful for.”</p>
<p id="line_409">“By the way, what will happen to Viscount Kazak?”</p>
<p id="line_410">As long as he remained a noble of Blumund Kingdom, we couldn’t punish him under the rules of our country. Even then, not being punished at all would be unacceptable. I didn’t want to cause further problems, but this depended on how the King of Blumund would handle it. And the King, who seemed to have understood that well enough, replied in a voice that abandoned all mercy.</p>
<p id="line_411">“Kazak is a Viscount. That man has done things tantamount to abandonment of his duties as a nobleman, such as helping local criminal organizations, to say the least. We cannot allow such a person to be a noble of Blumund. We deprived him of his title and wealth and exiled him from the country. In truth, we concluded this case with the ruination of his entire family.”</p>
<p id="line_412">If that was the case, then we had no problems with it.</p>
<p id="line_413">This might seem like a draconian punishment, but slave trade is an international criminal act. It would be deeply disparaging to Blumund if they were to give any lighter punishment.</p>
<p id="line_414">Thinking of it that way, the Viscount’s punishment wouldn’t seem like a harsh one anymore. As someone who had lived their whole life as a nobleman, it would be hard for Kazak to adapt his lifestyle. After losing his title and wealth, and being exiled from the country he lived in, it would probably be difficult enough for him to barely live through it.</p>
<p id="line_415">However, as long as he was alive, he could turn over a new leaf.</p>
<p id="line_416">I had no further opinion on the matter because I deemed it a punishment befitting of his crimes.</p>
<p id="line_417">“I understand, I shall see it as a punishment fit for him.”</p>
<p id="line_418">“It’s a relief to hear those words. Then, can I take this as us maintaining the agreement between our countries?”</p>
<p id="line_419">“That is something I would want as well. Then I’ll be in your care from now on.”</p>
<p id="line_420">The King of Blumund and I held our hands tightly and shook.</p>
<p id="line_421">And with this, the case came to a close.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_422">After that, we went on to the main topic.</p>
<p id="line_423">The King of Blumund put on a pleasant smile and asked, cutting to the chase, “By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, I heard back from Fuze. I believe he had told me that you had a grand plan in play?”</p>
<p id="line_424">He seemed to have heard about it in detail from Fuze.</p>
<p id="line_425">“This isn’t something that would end with just my country and your country. I think we should gather representatives for all countries involved and hold a meeting. I have considered stepping forward and explaining it to other nations, but…”</p>
<p id="line_426">“Hohoho, you’re quite reserved about it. I have heard a brief explanation from Fuze, but this could put our country in an awkward position. We cannot just leave this to the civil servants.”</p>
<p id="line_427">“Then, maybe a little bit—”</p>
<p id="line_428">I planned to open a formal meeting later on. Therefore, I ended my explanation stating that my plan was to make Blumund Kingdom the logistics hub.</p>
<p id="line_429">That’s what I did, but…</p>
<p id="line_430">“—Indeed. So that’s it.”</p>
<p id="line_431">“Sire, I believe we must carry out this plan regardless of its difficulties.”</p>
<p id="line_432">I only explained things loosely but the look in the King’s eyes had changed; they revealed his true nature full of burning ambitions. And even the Queen, who had been holding back from saying anything, couldn’t hide her excitement. It seemed like the Queen could keep up quite well too. It looked like they were able to calculate just how much profit they stood to gain from merely hearing my story.</p>
<p id="line_433"><em>Maybe there are more people to watch out for than just the King of Blumund.</em></p>
<p id="line_434">The King of Blumund with a gambler’s instinct, able to make rational snap decisions, and the composed and calculative queen. It’s because these two combined their strength that Blumund was able to maintain its influence despite being a small country.</p>
<p id="line_435">“We would have to discuss that after we conclude the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, without issues, in three days.”</p>
<p id="line_436">“If that’s so then I don’t think we need to worry. It’s already this prosperous when we haven’t even started. Without a doubt, this plan will require us to reach a consensus with the other countries involved. In preparation for that, we’ll be sure to solidify the public opinion in our country.”</p>
<p id="line_437">“Hmm, my Queen is right. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-dono, I’m glad to hear such good news. Then, we’ll excuse ourselves.”</p>
<p id="line_438">“We wish you the best for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,” the two of them said in unison, standing up.</p>
<p id="line_439">The nobles were just going around talking with each other, not wanting to waste our time. After hearing everything they needed from me, it probably meant that they had nothing else to see me for.</p>
<p id="line_440">In fact, they were easy to understand, and so I felt like they were good people.</p>
<p id="line_441">“Please do enjoy your stay in our kingdom.”</p>
<p id="line_442">“I will do so.”</p>
<p id="line_443">“Yes, I have great expectations.”</p>
<p id="line_444">The two left, leaving those words.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_445">It was the next day after meeting the royal couple of Blumund.</p>
<p id="line_446">The person who came looking for me was the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="dwarf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_447">“I have come, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Having not ridden the carriage in a long time seems to have tired me out.”</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/illustrations/image1.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_448"></p>
<p id="line_449">He sat down opposite to me, acting as dignified and confident as always, and reached out for the snacks placed on the table like it was normal.</p>
<p id="line_450">“Wait, leave some for me too.”</p>
<p id="line_451">Turns out that I was too late in stopping him. Every last donut I had saved for later had disappeared into <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mouth in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p id="line_452"><em>So he indulges in alcohol but curiously enough has a sweet tooth as well… It seems I can’t underestimate this man known as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, either.</em></p>
<p id="line_453">“What a small-minded guy. Seeing how you sweat the small details; you still have a lot to learn.”</p>
<p id="line_454"><em>What do you mean “I have a lot to learn.” You’re the one who inhaled someone else’s entire plate of donuts.</em></p>
<p id="line_455">I narrowed my eyes and stared at him. However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t flinch in the slightest and accepted the stare.</p>
<p id="line_456">“The elders spontaneously requested to come along, increasing the number of carriages dramatically. This is all your fault, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said.</p>
<p id="line_457">If they were to use the pegasi they could arrive within a day from Dwargon. But since this was a formal visit, they couldn’t use the pegasus knights.</p>
<p id="line_458">This wasn’t just for the escorts. There was a need for a large and powerful country like Dwargon to show its majesty to the nobles of other countries that would be visiting the festival. And for that reason, not only did they prepare multiple outfits to change into, but they also had to bring aides to manage all the clothes and servants to help change into them. Because there was a need to bring them all they had to plan a large-scale visit.</p>
<p id="line_459">“To act like a king, there needs to be a preparation to its scale. It was a relief that at least the roads were properly maintained but the last few days still made for a very tiring trip.”</p>
<p id="line_460">So that’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> often snuck away to visit here with a small number of people.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_461">Speaking of which, I received a report from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that the road to Blumund had been jam-packed. It was so crowded that they needed traffic enforcement and all the inns were full.</p>
<p id="line_462">This was a report gleefully calling for a larger scale of transportation.</p>
<p id="line_463">Modern Japan didn’t have problems with cars breaking down often. And even when it happened, there would be insurance agencies that would respond. However, it was always a big problem when carriages broke down in this world. Just clearing the carriage off of the road to not obstruct traffic took a lot of effort.</p>
<p id="line_464">You also had to take care of the horse’s condition, meaning you couldn’t use it however you wish.</p>
<p id="line_465">We had constructed the roads with extra width in preparation, but as expected, problems still arose. Though I did instruct them to collect information on how we could handle these problems in the future.</p>
<p id="line_466">Just now, after hearing what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, it dawned on me how big of a deal it was for nobles to travel.</p>
<p id="line_467">The current problem with congestion seemed to come down to there being a higher number of aristocrats participating than expected. So, next time it would be better to take more things into consideration.</p>
<p id="line_468">Though it would be better if we could invent the train and transport them using that… Well, putting that aside.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_469">“I didn’t know you would come in person. I had thought that you would send an emissary instead.”</p>
<p id="line_470">It was true that I didn’t expect <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to come. In hopes that he wouldn’t get angry, I responded honestly. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not convinced.</p>
<p id="line_471">“Hmph! How could I <em>not</em> come! You seemed to be plotting something again, so I couldn’t have peace of mind until I saw it with my own eyes to judge it myself! And… I have something to ask.”</p>
<p id="line_472">“What is it?”</p>
<p id="line_473">“You seem to have fought with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Sakaguchi…the rumor that you ended in a draw is a lie, right?”</p>
<p id="line_474">I did expect to be exposed but, as expected, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to know everything about my fight with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> already. Not only that, but he seemed to be completely convinced that the official statement was false.</p>
<p id="line_475">“Well, that is true. Although I did win the match, I feel like I lost the game, I guess a win is a win.”</p>
<p id="line_476">After firmly stating that this was a secret, I told <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the full story of the fight between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and me.</p>
<p id="line_477">“Unbelievable. That woman…in honesty is stronger than me. It would be another story if we were to talk just about swordsmanship, but in overall strength, I’d be pushed back. Yet you really still won?”</p>
<p id="line_478">Taking my lead, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> spoke honestly as well. There was no way the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would actually fight with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Therefore, he probably had a covert agent gather information and analyze her strength and concluded that he would be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p id="line_479">He must have been genuinely shocked that I had beaten someone of that caliber.</p>
<p id="line_480">“Luck also played a role in it.

<p id="line_486">Of course, I would never actually tell this to anyone.</p>

<p id="line_551">It seemed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> forced the position onto <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grucius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Looking at his skills alone, he didn’t lack the talent to fit in this position, so the others didn’t complain. They couldn’t let a talent like that go to waste by just letting him play around, so they requested him to be the chief of knights of the newly founded Famenas Kingdom.</p>
<p id="line_552">However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grucius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had a bitter expression.

<p id="line_559">Seeing this scene made me feel nostalgic. Until now it was a pattern that I had experienced over and over, but this time we had an unexpected intruder.</p>
<p id="line_560">“Really!

<p id="line_561">“Edgar! You’re so stiff.”</p>
<p id="line_562">“Haha, what of it. If the people see how quick-witted I am, everyone will realize that I’m most qualified to be the next successor to the throne.”</p>

Things will get complicated if you make such jokes. Since I’m working hard as an attendant for his Majesty to be a great king!”</p>
<p id="line_564">Edgar spoke with his face flushing red with anger. Surprisingly, I was told that he was the son of the former king, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Edmalis" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Although Edgar was only ten, he seemed very trustworthy. Seeing him already accustomed to pointing things out like that, he was probably going through a lot, despite being a wee lad. Dealing with a sloppy adult must be a strenuous job.</p>
<p id="line_565"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grucius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> may complain a lot, but they seemed to actually adore Edgar all the while.</p>
<p id="line_566">Although I would have liked to continue this heartwarming conversation, we had to move on. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party must’ve been exhausted from the long travels and other high-status people were coming here for the eve of the festival.</p>
<p id="line_567">After agreeing to have a drink with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> at our leisure later, I ended our conversation.</p>
<p id="line_568">“Putting that aside, I have a gift for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun for keeping your promise. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—”</p>

He brought up a certificate that he had prepared in advance.

<p id="line_573">The look in his eyes changed after examining it.</p>
<p id="line_574">“I-I shall void the remaining balance for the reparations. Is that what you’re saying?!”</p>
<p id="line_575">“That’s right, now with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as king, they serve no further need.”</p>
<p id="line_576">Actually, we already got 1,500 star gold coins. 10,000 star gold coins was an excessive amount, and since I had already achieved my goal, I did not need it anymore.</p>
<p id="line_577">“Haha, I don’t quite get it but that’s what he says, Edgar,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> beamed at the wide-eyed Edgar.</p>
<p id="line_578">Although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to understand, it looks like Edgar grasped the ramifications.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_583">As the afternoon rolled around, my busy schedule became a bit more relaxed.</p>
<p id="line_584">The stream of visitors kept pouring in, but in order to prepare for the evening’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, we didn’t have time for talks. There were a lot of people requesting an audience, but I decided to schedule them for a meeting after the festival.</p>
<p id="line_585">And so, after barely getting any time off, I went to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom to meet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as promised. On the way there I was going to visit the academy and bring the kids too. Since it was a festival, I thought that it would be nice for them to have some fun as well.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_586">The nostalgic scenery of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s streets.</p>
<p id="line_587">It had only been a few months, but a smile crept across my face as I remembered my time living here.</p>
<p id="line_588">I headed for the headquarters of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> without running into any trouble. Through modern-looking automatic glass doors, I stepped into a temperature-controlled room. At that moment, several sharp looks focused on me.</p>
<p id="line_589">This was a place that only people who were rank B or above could enter, so naturally, only skilled people were around. Satisfied with the place not looking any different from before, I slowly strolled around.</p>
<p id="line_590">I noticed that some people were trying to size me up. Seeing that they were gathered at the headquarters this early in the morning, there might’ve been a big job they were preparing for.</p>
<p id="line_591">“—Who is that?”</p>
<p id="line_592">“It’s not a face I know. A newcomer? Do you know?”</p>
<p id="line_593">“No, I don’t know anyone that beautiful.”</p>
<p id="line_594">Hearing whispers like that made me feel a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="line_595">To forget me in less than a year—at first, I was a little peeved, but then it hit me. I had forgotten that I wasn’t wearing a mask. Now being able to completely control my aura, I confidently went in with a bare face thinking that I didn’t need to wear it anymore.</p>
<p id="line_596">I had considered disguising myself, but it was already too late. Luckily, my clothes were those that I often wore as an adventurer, so if I acted confidently, no one would realize that I was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_597">After all, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> attire for the audience was masterfully handcrafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It was impossibly luxurious. The decorations were fancy, and it was a beautiful product of the highest quality. The headdress was also exquisitely decorated, making me look like a completely different person.</p>
<p id="line_598">In this world, the ability to take pictures has yet to become commonplace, so my face shouldn’t be widely known yet… It’ll probably be okay not to worry about it. I decided to just roll with this look.</p>
<p id="line_599">Someone blocked my way as I was confidently striding towards the reception desk.</p>
<p id="line_600">I felt like something like this had happened before.</p>
<p id="line_601">“Wait, I don’t know from which countryside you earned that B rank, but walking by without greeting your seniors is something unacceptable—hey, you. Don’t you know it’s the etiquette for a junior to reveal his name first?”</p>
<p id="line_602">Déjà vu—that was it, I remembered now.</p>
<p id="line_603">This guy was an acquaintance of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kabal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Seeing as how they complained about greeting seniors last time as well, he looked like the type who put great emphasis on and valued the relationship between juniors and seniors in a sportsman kind of way.</p>
<p id="line_604">“You, if I remember correctly, your name is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grasse" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? You seem to always be in the headquarters, do you have a lot of free time?”</p>
<p id="line_605">“Huh? You know my name? That means—”</p>
<p id="line_606">“I’m <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I was with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kabal" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party, remember?” I cut <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grasse" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> off and introduced myself.</p>
<p id="line_607">Putting that aside, what was up with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grasse" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? I <em>did</em> take off my mask, but my voice stayed the same, didn’t it? <em>Why don’t you recognize me…</em></p>
<p id="line_608">“What?! Ri-<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san?”</p>
<p id="line_609">“Yes. You, although it’s my first time showing you my face, you should be able to recognize me from my voice.”</p>
<p id="line_610">“Uh, um, I mean…huh? I think I remember you being a bit shorter back then?”</p>
<p id="line_611">As I revealed that my name was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grasse" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> quickly became confused. My rank was way higher than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grasse" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s, so if we were to base it on his standard, I was <em>his</em> superior.</p>
<p id="line_612">Fundamentally, adventurers are all about strength, making the relationships between seniors and juniors not nearly as important to most. When I first started out, I did occasionally show my respect to those I owed a favor, but I didn’t even owe any favors to this guy, so no reason to act as such. It would be another story if we took a job together, but among adventurers your rank was everything.</p>
<p id="line_613">“I grew.”</p>
<p id="line_614">Actually, I evolved, not grew, but I didn’t really have to be honest about that. I laced my tone with a hint of irritation, thankfully <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grasse" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the hint.</p>

Although he was weaselly, he was someone you just couldn’t hate.</p>
<p id="line_617">“Alright, alright. More importantly, you seem to always be here, is it okay for you to slack off?”</p>
<p id="line_618">“Hehe, please don’t say that. Actually, this is one of the jobs I took; I train newcomers here. As you might know, there are different levels of strength within the B rank, so it’s my job to teach those newcomers that act up.

<p id="line_620">“I don’t believe I changed much…”</p>
<p id="line_621">“No, No, No, No, please don’t say that, the only thing that we could recognize are your clothes.”</p>
<p id="line_622">“Yes, he’s right. That face is almost like a cheat. It goes well beyond merely catching someone’s eye…”</p>
<p id="line_623"><em>Hmm, is that so?</em></p>
<p id="line_624">“Alright, will wearing the mask suffice?”</p>
<p id="line_625">It was a hassle to go over this every time, so even if it was a bit of a bother, I didn’t think I had a choice. After I secretly made a mask within my ‘Stomach,’ I put it on my face. The adventurers’ moods deflated, their eyes filled with disappointment.</p>
<p id="line_626">I don’t know if that’s really something to make a fuss about, but it was over.</p>
<p id="line_627">“Then I’ll excuse myself. Don’t be too hard on the newcomers.”</p>
<p id="line_628">After leaving those words, I headed for the reception desk.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_629">I gave my name at the reception desk and requested to meet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Word apparently got through and the man at the reception desk directed me to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> immediately.</p>
<p id="line_630">“Oh, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. Long time no see! You seem to have gone through a lot of difficult experiences since the last time?”</p>
<p id="line_631">“It’s not something you can just sum up as being difficult. Getting a surprise attack from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s army marching down on us, I even got summoned by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s… It’s been a never-ending barrage of torment for me. Just saying ‘that it was difficult’ doesn’t even begin to describe the misery, wouldn’t you agree?”</p>
<p id="line_632">“Haha, even after all that, coming out unscathed feels just like you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> responded playfully, but it was true that those things were actually awfully grueling to deal with. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> probably understood this too. Although he was smiling cheerfully his voice did contain a touch of compassion.</p>
<p id="line_633">“In short, since I have made up with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I can say that it all turned out well in the end.”</p>
<p id="line_634">“That seems to be the case.

Regrettably, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> does seem like the type who is loyal to a fault.”</p>
<p id="line_635">“Ah, I know what you mean. She doesn’t listen at all to what others say.”</p>
<p id="line_636">“You’re right. She’s the type that only believes what she has seen and heard with her own eyes and ears. That personality of hers has put me through quite a lot over the years…”</p>
<p id="line_637">That we could agree on, launching into a delightful conversation.</p>
<p id="line_638">Yeah. There were moments when I had no clue what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was thinking.

<p id="line_639">“Well, but you’re the only one I can talk about this with, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.”</p>

In the first place, disparaging people wasn’t something you should often do. Therefore, I thought that I should be careful as well.</p>
<p id="line_641">“Well that’s that, so what do you think? You don’t have to push it if you’re busy, but if two or three days is okay, wouldn’t you like to participate in the festival?”</p>
<p id="line_642">“Heh, I should go, of course. I’ve been desperately finishing my work just to attend, you know? And, not to worry, I have a trustworthy subordinate to take care of my work while I’m absent. Wait a moment.”</p>
<p id="line_643">After I brought up the real purpose of my visit today, asking if he’s attending the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> left those words and stood up, then seemingly calling someone, he left the room.</p>
<p id="line_644">I took a sip of the tea he had left me, and not much time had passed before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> returned with a woman in tow.</p>
<p id="line_645">“I’ll introduce her to you.

Her appearance was one of beauty and elegance, clothed in what resembled a suit with ornate designs unique to this world. It suited her perfectly. She had navy-blue eyes and blonde hair tied in a bun, but most remarkable were her long, pointed ears. Her species was undoubtedly elven in nature.</p>
<p id="line_646">“Nice to meet you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Tempest.

<p id="line_647">“Happy to meet you. This is my second time here, but it seems we weren’t able to meet the last time?”</p>
<p id="line_648">I had seen the woman who served the tea, but it was my first time seeing someone called <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <em>If it’s someone great enough to be the deputy, I wish he would have introduced me to her earlier</em>—but there was a reason for that.</p>

<p id="line_650">“Haha, there wasn’t much I could do about that; I just recently returned. My lifelong passion has been the exploration of ruins, and a few days ago we discovered the world’s largest ancient ruins, ‘Soma.”’</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_651"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was at the top of her field in the exploration sector. Before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> established the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she was said to have been captivated by ruins, exploring them day and night. Yet because she didn’t participate in an adventurer’s group, which was the core feature of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, her name was not well known. Regardless, her skills were undoubtedly exceptional, catching <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s attention, who then recruited her.</p>
<p id="line_652">Fighting wasn’t the only purpose of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—a sentiment <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> believed in as well, hence the appointment of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, an expert archeologist, to the honorable position of deputy. And with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s support, it was said that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san had made a breakthrough achievement this time. That was the surprising discovery of the ancient ruins called “Soma.”</p>
<p id="line_653">With this outstanding feat under her belt, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s reputation was revised in the public eye. Even those who were convinced that she had been afforded a high position solely through her personal connections with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> now acknowledged and revered her as the deputy grandmaster.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_654">“We discovered the ruins, but we still have a lot left to explore. We were only able to make a full map of the top floor; many of its riddles remain yet to be solved.”</p>
<p id="line_655">“But that’s the job of the exploration adventurers. If they have <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s map, even they could explore without problems.”</p>
<p id="line_656">Instead of leaving it all to one accomplished exploration adventurer, it seemed like they were mobilizing people to start excavating. Since it would also help nurture young rookies, I think it would be killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p id="line_657">And so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san took up the job of training exploration adventurers of at least rank B at the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> headquarters.</p>
<p id="line_658">The pay was quite high, and apparently, some of the income earned from selling the things found in the ancient ruins went straight into her pockets. Considering that the transactions were all made through the guild, the profits they reaped couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p id="line_659">“I see. Ruins seem to be quite profitable.”</p>
<p id="line_660">“That’s right. Although in my case I’m not in it for the money, it’s more of a hobby. Although, occasionally, I put the things I found up for auction to top off the activity funds.”</p>
<p id="line_661">As expected, exploring ruins was expensive, she seemed to have had a hard time.</p>
<p id="line_662"><em>Yes, yes, talking about ruins…</em></p>
<p id="line_663">“I have something I want to ask, who owns the ruins? Does the country they are in manage it?”</p>
<p id="line_664">“Uh-um, that’s a bit complicated. Take, for instance, the topic of our conversation, the ancient ruins of ‘Soma’; they are under the administration of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That’s because its location is a bit of a gray area, found in the region far west of the Western Nations in the desert known as ‘Barren Lands.”’</p>
<p id="line_665">“Strictly speaking, the ‘Barren Lands’ is close to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Dagruel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s territory, causing everyone to fear it and dissuading any attempts to rule it. So, no one currently claims ownership of the ruins found there.”</p>
<p id="line_666">“Is that so… Then, as expected, it is necessary to carefully consider how to manage such a place…”</p>
<p id="line_667">“Huh? Is there something that’s bothering you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, seemingly bothered by my reaction.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_668">The thing on my mind was, of course, the ruins under Clayman’s castle. Likely magical items and other things were sleeping in that place, so exploring it would, by my estimation, earn us some hefty profits.</p>
<p id="line_669">But there was something that bothered me. It was the question of rightful ownership surrounding the findings from the ruins. Another thing that bothered me was the potential of attracting unsavory adventurers in it only for the money or even distasteful outlaws.</p>
<p id="line_670">Although the proposal of digging up treasure in ancient ruins was enticing, we ought to consider their historical value as well. Investigating them can tell us a lot about how the ancient people lived back then. The world of ancient civilizations captures a certain sense of fascination. If we act too hastily, we will run the risk of destroying valuable information. That was my biggest concern.</p>
<p id="line_671">The ruins weren’t something I intended to hide from them, so I decided to discuss the matter with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. It seems like I came at just the right time to meet an exploration specialist.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_672">“The truth is, I found ruins in Clayman’s base.”</p>
<p id="line_673">“What? Is that true?!”</p>
<p id="line_674">The moment I said that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san shot a sharp stare at me, radiating an incredibly intense force that made my skin crawl. I was somewhat taken aback but decided to continue my explanation.</p>
<p id="line_675">“Clayman had accumulated an immense fortune, and he also handed weapons and shields with magic effects to his subordinates. So I was wondering if he was making use of the things he found in those ruins, but—”</p>
<p id="line_676">“—But?”</p>
<p id="line_677">After hesitating a bit, I let out my thoughts.</p>
<p id="line_678">“It may be rude to say this to people who make a living with ruin exploration, but I refuse to tear apart the ruins merely for a chance of treasure. What kind of life and culture did the residents have and what ultimately lead to their downfall—these are the things I want to find out. Even if it’s just to make meaningful use of the past, I think we should show our respect to the ancient people.”</p>
<p id="line_679">Well, those were probably just my overly emotional thoughts. It’s not that I didn’t have an interest in treasures, but I believed there to be something more important. And that’s why I ordered for the ruins to be sealed for now.</p>
<p id="line_680">“Hmm, surprisingly, you’re quite the romanticist,<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="In this context it means fanciful, unrealistic, and passionate." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san…”</p>
<p id="line_681">“’Surprisingly,’ what do you mean? I’m a romanticist through and through.”</p>
<p id="line_682">“Haha. Hearing that, I guess you’re right.

<p id="line_683">As for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she was nodding while deep in thought. The murderous look in her eyes had long subsided, now shining with the light of reason.</p>
<p id="line_684">“I wonder… It’s something I haven’t thought of, but I can understand. I would also like to prevent wanton destruction of the ruins. Therefore, I’m planning to properly educate the research group before dispatching them to Soma.”</p>
<p id="line_685">My sentiment—romanticism for the ancient times—didn’t get across, but I think she at least understood that the ruins needed to be protected.</p>
<p id="line_686"><em>She’s a well-qualified person, so maybe I should ask her to explore the ruins.</em></p>
<p id="line_687"><em>Then that still leaves me with the question…</em></p>
<p id="line_688">“In regard to Clayman’s territory, it is currently under my sole authority. Later on, it will be merged with Milim’s territory, but right now we’re the ones who are managing it, after all, we’re the ones who defeated Clayman. I think even that guy took good care of the ruins, we wouldn’t want to be the ones to ruin it, right? That’s why I thought we should get Milim on board with this and have her take good care of the ruins.”</p>
<p id="line_689">“Huh-hmm, so <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san won’t be the one to continue managing it?”</p>
<p id="line_690">“I think that would be difficult. It’s adjacent to the Eastern Empire, making considerations for the perimeter defense a hassle—something needlessly tedious. We can’t spare the military forces to fortify that area in the first place.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_691">Clayman’s territory was the buffer zone with the Eastern Empire. There you could find a road known as the Valley of Death that wound its way through jagged mountains. It was a rough, unfastened road that, if you managed to pass, would allow you to travel between Clayman’s territory and the Empire. Despite this treacherous road being laden with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, traces of Clayman’s subordinates using the road had been found. Therefore, the Empire was possibly in collaboration with Clayman and might mobilize their forces. We would have to remain vigilant.</p>
<p id="line_692">Even if we wanted to dispatch an army there, we were too short on numbers. Managing the Jura Great Forest on its own was already an arduous task, and so if I could leave Clayman’s territory in Milim’s hands, it would be up to her alone, if or when the Empire decided to make a move.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_693">“Then, does it mean that we need <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Milim’s permission to explore the ruins?”</p>
<p id="line_694">“That would be the case.”</p>
<p id="line_695">“Is that so… You’ve intrigued me with those ruins, can’t we somehow take a look?”</p>
<p id="line_696">“I doubt she would turn us down if we asked, but she would, in all likelihood, ask to come along.”</p>
<p id="line_697">“That would be…”</p>
<p id="line_698">She seemed hesitant to go exploring together with Milim, which came as no surprise, considering that that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was infamous for causing disasters. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> already looked dejected—<em>but it’s too early to give up.

<p id="line_699">“I intended to investigate them sooner or later anyway, and I’d feel reassured if a pro like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were to come along. This too might be fate, so I would like to formally request an investigation from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, with remuneration, what do you think?”</p>
<p id="line_700">“In other words, the rights to the things found in the ruins will belong to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san?”</p>
<p id="line_701">“No, that needs to be discussed. I have my own museum, leading me to be more interested in displaying things there than digging. First, it’s part of Milim’s territory, we have to discuss it with her. I think it would be difficult to decide now.”</p>
<p id="line_702">“I see. Regardless, you’ll still be doing your own investigations, correct?”</p>
<p id="line_703">“That’s it!”</p>
<p id="line_704">“So, I’d be happy to accept your offer if I didn’t have to worry about the funding.

If that was so, then there was no problem. I would take on the job of convincing Milim and leave the organization of the investigation team to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.</p>
<p id="line_706">“Can I entrust this to you?”</p>
<p id="line_707">“Yes! Please leave that request to our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>

<p id="line_709">That was the situation. The conversation had completely derailed at this point. The whole point of me being there in the first place was to invite <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_710">“Then I’ll let you handle everything, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kagali" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I’m sorry that you can’t enjoy the festival with us.”</p>
<p id="line_711">“Hahaha, it’s alright.

<p id="line_712">“Yup, I’ll leave the rest to you!”</p>
<p id="line_713">After our little greeting, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I left the Association headquarters.</p>
<p id="line_714">Things were on the up-and-up for the exploration of the ruins, as we received a helping hand from a place we never expected it. Previously, I was having a hard time deciding who to take along, but I felt reassured now that a pro was taking part. I was eagerly looking forward to checking out the ruins after we wrapped up the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and took a short break. <em>Who knows, maybe it could be reference material for the dungeon. There’ll be a lot for me to study</em>.</p>
<p id="line_715">I thought about these things while taking <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to our next destination.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_716">I removed my mask as I was leaving the Association’s headquarters. Since its ability to hide my <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had become meaningless now, I didn’t have to wear it unless I was in a place where someone was likely to bother me.</p>
<p id="line_717"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came over to speak to me, with a giant bag in tow. He must have prepared in advance, like I told him to in the letter I had sent. The ridiculous size of that bag suggested that he intended to stay for a couple of days.</p>
<p id="line_718">“You’re bringing those kids to the festival too, right?”</p>
<p id="line_719">“Yep. Since I reconciled with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there’s no one openly hostile to us. There might be some small incidents here and there, but when it comes to security, I’m well prepared.”</p>
<p id="line_720">Since we’re inviting prominent figures from each country, we’re especially focused on that part. Therefore, inviting those five kids to our country’s festival won’t be an issue.</p>
<p id="line_721">“Okay, then I will allow it,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded, then continued with a smile, “they’ve been studying and behaving well lately, so I think it’s okay to give them a breather.”</p>
<p id="line_722">We didn’t send a letter to let the kids know in advance, meaning this would be a total surprise to them. I kept quiet about it until I could be sure that it was okay. I hoped they would understand that part. Normally with things like this, you would need to get the person’s consent first, but, depending on the situation, inviting the kids could be postponed. I believed that it would be better than getting them all excited only to let them down.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_723">A short walk later, the familiar school building came into view. The imposing structure was the pride of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, a training institution for association members—the Freedom Academy.</p>
<p id="line_724">After a brief exchange with the guard, he immediately conveyed the message inside. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s presence expedited the process immensely, he was the chairman after all, and the person to guide us soon arrived.</p>
<p id="line_725">After greeting the principal, we headed for the classroom.</p>
<p id="line_726">“Hey. Have you kids been well—“ Before I could finish, Alice came charging like a bullet, ramming me squarely in the stomach.</p>
<p id="line_727">“You’re late, sensei!”</p>
<p id="line_728"><em>How could it be? It didn’t really feel like it had been that long, so maybe it’s because I’m an adult?</em> Kids have a different sense of time; they must’ve felt lonely.</p>
<p id="line_729">“Yeah! You promised to come to play often!”</p>
<p id="line_730">“Yes, Gale is right. I was worried that you had forgotten all about us.”</p>
<p id="line_731">“But now you’re here, we’re so happy, sensei!”</p>
<p id="line_732">Gale, Kenya, Ryota, these three gathered around me had big smiles on their faces, in spite of their complaints.</p>
<p id="line_733">And lastly, Chloe as well, “Welcome, sensei!”</p>
<p id="line_734">She came running and hugged me with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_735">“You’re still as popular as ever, I’m envious,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> observed while looking at the children.</p>
<p id="line_736">“Ah, big bro <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is here too!”</p>
<p id="line_737">“Big bro <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you’re going to battle me today too, right?”</p>
<p id="line_738">“Me too!”</p>
<p id="line_739">“That’s a good idea. I’ve been able to get a good grip of the spirit’s power recently.”</p>
<p id="line_740">As the kids recognized <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, their happiness shot through the roof. Kenya challenged him, while Gale and Ryota seemed to have the same in mind. Now that they could properly control their powers, they seemed to really want to try out their skills.</p>
<p id="line_741">However, that’s not what today was going to be about.</p>
<p id="line_742">“Ah-haha, it’ll take another hundred years before you get a shot at beating me!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> teased. “I can be your opponent, but not today.”</p>
<p id="line_743">“Awwww, why?” Kenya grumbled, at which point I decided to jump into the conversation, “It’s a shame, but we don’t have time today.”</p>
<p id="line_744">“What are you saying?” Chloe asked as her eyes widened in excitement.</p>
<p id="line_745">I looked her straight in the eyes and answered, “I’m inviting the five of you to my country. There is a festival tomorrow. But if you don’t really want to go—”</p>
<p id="line_746">“Hurry up, let’s get ready!”</p>
<p id="line_747">“Alright, Ken-chan!”</p>
<p id="line_748">“Wooow! Tell us important stuff like that sooner!!”</p>
<p id="line_749">“That’s right, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei! You’re telling us too suddenly!!”</p>
<p id="line_750">“Ah, but I’m still excited!!”</p>
<p id="line_751">The kids darted off without letting me finish. They had all agreed to go in a heartbeat.</p>
<p id="line_752">“Just pack up a change of clothes!” I shouted after them, but there was no response.</p>
<p id="line_753">They disappeared in a gust of excitement.</p>
<p id="line_754">The teacher left standing in the classroom had observed our interaction with a surprised expression. And once the kids disappeared, he let out a sigh of defeat.</p>
<p id="line_755">“Ah, how amazing. They never treated me with such affection…”</p>
<p id="line_756">“Ahaha, you’re doing well. It’s gotten a little bit better now, but there are no other teachers who can handle those kids.”</p>
<p id="line_757">“No, it’s nothing. If you don’t show your skill, they won’t take your lead. It’s, admittedly, a pretty reasonable demand. Embarrassingly enough to say, even I could lose if I were careless. The strength of those kids is the real deal. Anyway—“ told me a teacher I was unfamiliar with, someone they likely hired as my replacement back then.</p>
<p id="line_758">“Ah, I’ve yet to introduce myself. I am the kids’ former advisor, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I apologize for interrupting the class.”</p>
<p id="line_759">“Ah, you really are <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei. I heard a lot about you from the kids, so I guessed it was you. My name is Clouse. I was employed at this academy as your replacement. Don’t worry about the class; I was informed in advance by the chairman that the class could be on break for a while,” Clouse-sensei said with a defeated smile.</p>
<p id="line_760">According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Clouse-san was an A- rank adventurer of the subjugation division. At his ripe old age of 50 he was slowly preparing for retirement.</p>
<p id="line_761">“Wait a minute? If they’ve gotten so far as rivaling you, then just how much stronger have those little rascals gotten?”</p>
<p id="line_762">“What are you saying? They are going around, proudly proclaiming that they were taught by none other than you.”</p>
<p id="line_763">“Yeah, that’s right. Honestly, if I were ever to get foolishly careless, even I would lose to them,” came the admission from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_764"><em>If he said so too, it’s gotta be true.</em></p>
<p id="line_765"><em>No, no, it’s really amazing that they were able to grow this much in such a short amount of time,</em> I marveled, deeply impressed, when Clouse set his gaze on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and me with a determined look.</p>
<p id="line_766">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I have a request.”</p>
<p id="line_767">“Yes? What is it?”</p>
<p id="line_768">“I would like to ask <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama to listen as well, as this is about the kids—before long, they will surpass me in strength if this carries on. We’ve seen this happen time and again; If the kids become complacent, it’ll be to their detriment. We need an adult that can be a mountain for them to climb.”</p>
<p id="line_769">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p id="line_770">“Elementary, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Those kids have much room to improve. We need someone who would teach them how to fight, so that they won’t be satisfied with merely beating me.”</p>
<p id="line_771"><em>I wonder.</em></p>
<p id="line_772">Clouse-san was worrying for them like they were his own kids. Each of them housed a greater spirit of their own, allowing them to borrow that power to neutralize the energy they were imbued with on their travel through worlds as an “Otherworlder.” As they grow older, they would eventually gain the ability to control it on their own, opening the path for them to use the excess energy in fights, allowing even things like ‘Spirit Magic’ to be wielded with ease. That way, they could become powerful spirit-wielder<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Fuse’s note defines this role as “Elementalist,” but the kanji writes “Spirit-wielder.” Somehow I feel the latter makes more sense." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> like Shizu-san.</p>
<p id="line_773">Moreover, a Spirit of Light deemed Kenya to be in possession of the qualifications to become a ‘True <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ so under the guidance of a great teacher, acquiring tremendous strength could be within his grasp.</p>
<p id="line_774">Like Clouse-san said, we needed to find a great teacher. But that raised the question—</p>
<p id="line_775">“That’s it. We need to find someone to be a good teacher for those kids, right? But if it’s someone stronger than Clouse, he would need to be an active A rank. Having a first-class adventurer like that take on the role of a teacher is a bit of a stretch…”</p>
<p id="line_776"><em>That’s the problem.</em></p>
<p id="line_777">Once you retire from the adventurer lifestyle, then accepting a stable job in education makes sense. But if you’re an active adventurer, it would be in your best financial interests to prioritize doing more high ranked jobs, rather than looking after kids. And even from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s perspective, it would only be right for them to have the great and talented people prioritize protecting the public.</p>
<p id="line_778">“Precisely. Assuming at least Rank A, I can’t think of anyone who would accept the job of a teacher. If it’s academic studies or various adventuring skills I could teach them, but alas…” Clouse let out a sigh.</p>
<p id="line_779">In spite of him being the one who suggested it, he fully understood that it was a difficult task. That must be the case. Asking adventurers to be teachers would be difficult. Then… Thinking along those lines I gave a suggestion, “Then how about we do this? I am planning to build a school in our country. We have plenty of B ranks and our ‘Sword Master’ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is the instructor. Based purely on swordsmanship, he still outpaces me comfortably, he could teach them—”</p>
<p id="line_780">If we were to focus solely on swordsmanship, it’d be okay to leave it to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But I wanted to teach lots of other stuff besides that.</p>
<p id="line_781">“That’s amazing! Then can we entrust the kids to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s country?”</p>
<p id="line_782">“That’s one option. But if we were to do that, it would be hard for the kids to learn about human society.”</p>
<p id="line_783">Living among humans teaches one the common sense required to get along in their society. If we were to deprive them of this opportunity, I was afraid that they might grow up with a lack of communication skills.</p>
<p id="line_784">Over the course of time, the number of adventurers would increase, and their kids would probably go to schools. But that was still a future awaiting us several years from now. Until then, they would be learning in an environment without any other human children, and I thought that that could pose a bit of a problem.</p>
<p id="line_785">“Ahh, because there are only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and no human children.”</p>
<p id="line_786">“I see. That could be a problem…”</p>
<p id="line_787"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Clouse-san ostensibly shared my apprehension and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_788">I was glad to be on the same page with them.</p>
<p id="line_789">But it was too early to relax. There was one last thing weighing on me.</p>
<p id="line_790">“Well, there is the option of leaving only the skill training to us. We can utilize teleportation magic after all, conveniently making it possible to take care of them a few times a week. But more importantly, I think the kids need to deepen their understanding of the spirits.”</p>
<p id="line_791">At this point it wasn’t an issue yet, but this also wasn’t a matter we could just accept and forget. To protect the lives of the children, each of them had a spirit in their bodies. To use that power properly, I thought it necessary to know more about the spirits.</p>
<p id="line_792">And that was something I could not teach. Saying this might be too obvious, but my knowledge is something I learned through experiencing it myself. Like trying to explain how to breathe, my disposition would make it prohibitively difficult to explain. You could easily expound the nature of spirits, yet doing so will never capture the essence.</p>
<p id="line_793">That’s when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s combat tactics came to mind—one of them the technique of fusing spiritual magic with a sword. Reaching those depths requires a similarly deep understanding of spirits.</p>
<p id="line_794"><em>If we could teach that to the children…</em></p>
<p id="line_795">“If we’re talking about spirits, then the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s are unmatched.

<p class="space-break" id="line_800">I could see the kids running towards us with their luggage.</p>

<p id="line_802"><em>We’re really just sweeping our problems under the rug, but I’m sure it’ll probably work itself out somehow.</em></p>

Since this wasn’t magic, it could be cast without the use of a magic circle. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked at me surprised, but the kids were already used to it.</p>
<p id="line_805">“That’s so easy for you, sensei, you should come visit us more often!” was the complaint I ended up hearing from Kenya. He had a point, so I ended up apologizing. I struggled to find the time among the many things vying for my attention, I couldn’t guarantee their safety either, but that didn’t need to be mentioned. There’s no reason to bring up trivialities that just make the kids feel uncomfortable. So I just brushed it off and promised to visit more often.</p>
<p id="line_806">After that, I guided <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the children to the inn that I was very proud of.</p>
<p id="line_807">Separate from the section housing the kings and nobles of each country, this was a private sector for the executives to stay in.</p>
<p id="line_808">After seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> off to his room, I turned to look at the kids.</p>
<p id="line_809">“I’m sorry but I have things left to do. I think I can only meet you at night.”</p>
<p id="line_810">“ “ “Huuuh—?!” ” ” the kids cried out in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p id="line_811">“Hush!” I took out a pendant and showed it to the sulking kids to quiet them down.</p>
<p id="line_812">“I considered using this to play a game—?”</p>
<p id="line_813">Before the words could leave my lips, the kids’ eyes lit up, gone was their bellyaching as they were captivated with what I was about to say.</p>
<p id="line_814">Once I confirmed that I had captured their attention, I continued to explain.</p>
<p id="line_815">“Check it out, this is a free pass to all of the street stalls that will be installed for the festival starting tomorrow. With this, you can eat and drink at any store, all you want, and you can freely enter any event venues as well. However, the budget has an upper limit, it’s 100 silver coins—use them all up, and it’s game over. If that happens, you must go back to your room, where homework will be waiting for you as punishment. If you have kept up with your studies until now, you’ll be able to have a blast for all three days. So, do you want to play my game?”</p>
<p id="line_816">I knew from the start that I would be saddled with taking care of the kids, so I concocted a way to compensate in advance. To get the most out of a festival, having money to spend on snacks and trinkets is indispensable. Allowing them to roam freely was the main idea. I felt sorry that I couldn’t be with them, but I thought that the kids would be able to enjoy going around by themselves.</p>
<p id="line_817"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and his subordinates were on duty for surveillance inside the city. Even if they were to go their separate ways, I already had it set up for them to be monitored in secret.</p>
<p id="line_818">And so I had prepared for the kids to be able to enjoy themselves without worry. The amount of allowance was an unconventional 100 silver coins. Most of the things they’d sell at the street stalls wouldn’t even be worth 1 silver coin, so it would be hard for them to spend it all in three days. It was a game in name only, a simple excuse.</p>
<p id="line_819">“I wanna play!”</p>
<p id="line_820">“There seem to be a lot of weird things, you’re excited, right, Ken?”</p>
<p id="line_821">“Yup. It seems like fun!”</p>
<p id="line_822">“Thank you, sensei.”</p>
<p id="line_823">“Oh, we’ll also buy you a present, sensei!”</p>
<p id="line_824">The kids fell for my scheme, hook, line, and sinker. They were overcome with excitement in anticipation of the festival that started tomorrow.</p>
<p id="line_825">I gave out a pendant to each of the kids, then looked them up-and-down before nodding. I thought to myself, <em>it’s only natural for there to be a lot of excitement on the eve of a festiva</em>l.</p>
<p id="line_826">I had considered telling them that Ramiris was in town, but I decided against it. I had planned for them to meet at the end of the festival anyway, there was no need to rush. Additionally, the kids, with Kenya and Alice in the lead, seemed like they were busy making plans for the next three days starting tomorrow.</p>
<p id="line_827">For the remaining time, the hotel’s waitresses would be taking care of the kids.</p>
<p id="line_828">“Then, you guys, if something happens, tell it to the waitresses in the inns. I don’t imagine this would become necessary, but if you really want to contact me, hold the pendant and pray in your mind. It will activate magic that sends messages.”</p>
<p id="line_829">“ “ “Okay!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_830">It sparked joy in me, seeing the kids answer so energetically. I didn’t think the kids would be raising a ruckus anymore, so I slipped out of the room.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_831">And with this, I could mark the end of today’s checklist.</p>
<p id="line_832">There was still a little time before the eve of the festival and I thought of resting for a bit in preparation for tonight, but… It didn’t seem like it would go the way I wanted it to.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_913">Later that night, in the lobby of the extravagantly decorated parlor house, the important figures of each country were gathered in once place. There was a large number of nobles attending, each garbed in luxurious and flashy clothing.</p>
<p id="line_914">Looking at the ratio between men and women, I felt like there were a couple more men.

There were attendees of all different ages, it seemed.</p>
<p id="line_915">This time people could participate freely, leading me to put a lot of effort into this being a fun party. It was arranged so that the people can enjoy meals while standing, with various dishes placed on buffet tables for guests to enjoy as they strolled around.</p>
<p id="line_916">Additionally, we had set up curiosities that were unheard of in any other country. Among them was a “tatami room,” which covered half of the wide space, and where it was prohibited to wear your shoes.

But it wasn’t like it remained deserted, I could occasionally witness people sitting down and getting flustered by the unfamiliar sitting cushions—King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was one of them.

<p id="line_917">I was told that he inspected the city’s developmental situation this morning, and things like the sewage system, as well as the work-in-progress rails, caught his eye. Not only that, but I heard he was also staring at the facilities and recreational equipment that I came up with on a whim, like he would gobble them all up.</p>
<p id="line_918">“That thing called a ‘rail,’ with what purpose did you make it?”</p>
<p id="line_919">“I have something to consult you about, regarding it. I plan to develop a thing called a ‘train.’ I hope that I can count on your assistance.”</p>

Most deemed it favorable and had asked many questions to the one in charge of the bathhouse.

The ingredients providing the medicinal effects were a tightly guarded secret, severely hampering attempts to reproduce it.</p>
<p id="line_928">I had received copious requests, asking us to introduce them to their countries as well, but I decided to gather and file those guests’ requests for later review.</p>

I am <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I would prefer for this night to be free of serious topics, and instead would like to direct you towards our nation’s dishes that I hope you will enjoy. Long speeches are not my strength, so please excuse me for cutting it short. I wish you all a grand time; let the party begin!”</p>
<p id="line_934">The preparation was perfect. The way we served the dishes was the cherry on top. I hoped our sincerity could be conveyed fully.</p>
<p id="line_935">Each table had a waitress assigned and Vester strictly educated them to bring dishes with every request. Everything was laid out to serve the guests—the results of intense education and training were now on full display.</p>
<p id="line_936">I called for a toast after I finished my greeting.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_937">The eve of the festival had been set in motion.</p>
<p id="line_938">Gasps swept through the crowds as they all drank a glass of cold beer. Tempest’s beer must have been surprising to those who had only tried poorly carbonated drinks before. After all, they were kept freezing cold.</p>
<p id="line_939">The method of preparing a cold glass cup, was something taught by the meticulous style of Japanese service. Even for my own sake, it wasn’t something I could compromise on.</p>
<p id="line_940">Not only that, but elven ladies were pouring alcohol. It wasn’t forced, you know? I only accepted those who voluntarily offered to help.</p>
<p id="line_941">This was another huge success. Beautiful elven ladies were roaming around the banquet hall carrying various kinds of alcoholic beverages. Those who were accustomed to wearing formal dress seemed to be enraptured by the Yukata adorned elves’ voluptuous figures. In addition, the way the elves greeted the guests by putting three fingers on the floor, shook the hearts of men equally among all nations. I could see their faces turn red even when they weren’t drunk. The view of the elves’ chests, laid bare behind the Yukata, must’ve been an alluring sight.</p>
<p id="line_942"><em>Hehehe. Like I intended.</em></p>
<p id="line_943">I would say that this was the pinnacle of merging western and Japanese traditional culture. The heterogenous mixture of those clad in Yukatas among the nobles wearing formal attire made for quite the scene—it was something you could only see here.</p>
<p id="line_944">That was what we planned, but, nonetheless, it ended up being a wildly chaotic party. From a commonsense standpoint, this really looked like a mess. But if this bothered you, then you had already lost.</p>
<p id="line_945">I acted as if this was the norm and observed the condition of the guests.</p>
<p id="line_946">The extravagant dishes on the tables were made by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Yoshida, who went through a lot of effort to create delectable meals, and I could confidently say that the guests would all be satisfied with them. Smoked chicken-duck meat and sandwiches filled with vegetables, cow-deer steak, fried vegetables marinated in sauce, karaage fried chicken, roast beef salad.</p>
<p id="line_947">We also prepared a sherbet made with an assortment of fruits as refreshments, and going so far as to recreate dishes like the black tiger meat stew and grilled fairy-leather bird from the Walpurgis banquet. Although we had quite a hard time looking for the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> we could use as ingredients, we were somehow able to track them down within three days, using the information we had gathered before.</p>
<p id="line_948">We were able to satisfy the aristocrats, who were accustomed to luxury, with the dishes made from precious ingredients that were the pride of our country.</p>
<p id="line_949">That wasn’t all. In the banquet hall, at the dividing line between the Japanese traditional space and the western space, a large fish was being carted in. It was a fish with an extremely hard exoskeleton and a sharp, spear-like horn. This abominable ocean <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was called a “spear tuna,” and, excluding the horn, had grown to four meters in length of heinous-looking fish.</p>
<p id="line_950">Now, the reason why we brought this fish. It had, in fact, a delicious, savory taste to all of that blubber, which was unthinkable, based solely on its appearance. Under the armor-like exoskeleton, red meat that looked similar to tuna was hidden.</p>
<p id="line_951">I actually caught the fish by coincidence during the course of a competitive fishing match, which <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I had placed bets on, and, fortunately, I thought to use ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ before tossing it away. It was found to have non-toxic and highly nutritious meat. I dipped it in our commercially available soy sauce before giving it a try, and…it was exceptionally delicious.</p>
<p id="line_952">I remembered this savory treat and decided to unveil it before everyone at the banquet, so I went out by myself and caught one. I was used to traveling under water, so it was a great experience. But we’d have someone else catch it next time.</p>
<p id="line_953">So anyway, the fish was a recent catch and still fresh.</p>
<p id="line_954"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was responsible for cutting the fish, and using the long kitchen knife <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had forged, he made us sashimi previously. But this time, as a performance to entertain the guests, the process of preparing the dish was slowly shown in front of everyone.</p>
<p id="line_955"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s kitchen knife was flying to and fro, avoiding the hard exoskeleton armor. The spear tuna was dismembered in a beautiful display of artistic skill. It was something even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be astonished with. Holding that kitchen knife, he made the impression of a dignified master.</p>
<p id="line_956">Behind me, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was holding the kitchen knife I had gifted her, looking like she wanted to help out, but I calmed her down, telling her to bear it this time.</p>
<p id="line_957">We had invited numerous prominent figures from foreign countries, so naturally, we absolutely could not present a dish prepared by unskilled hands. This wasn’t something we could play off as a joke. I just hoped <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could properly fulfill her role as my secretary and guard.</p>
<p id="line_958">As for the reactions coming from the guests, at first, they were frightened and scared by the grotesque sight, but, as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s excellent performance of carving up the fish progressed, their faces started to shine with admiration.</p>
<p id="line_959">The head was discarded, and the body was divided into four pieces, then sliced up as the plates were loaded with sashimi. In the middle laid the marbled belly meat, enveloped by red meat. The mouthwatering sight alone had me drooling, but the majority of people present hadn’t tried it before and remained hesitant, waiting for someone to make the first move.</p>
<p id="line_960"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked at those crowds and made sushi as well.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/illustrations/image4.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_961"></p>
<p id="line_962">It was a specialty that I had not expected him to have.</p>
<p id="line_963">White rice, alcohol, vinegar, cooking wine, and soy sauce—these alone opened the door to a vast assortment of sophisticated dishes. That said, I had never seriously expected that I would be able to eat authentic sushi in this world. As it turned out, back when <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was young, he often heard his grandfather mention…he had fond memories of sushi, its taste forever eluding him since his arrival in this world. He must’ve been deeply embittered by that.</p>
<p id="line_964">Thinking of it this way, I sure was a lucky guy. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said this as well, claiming that reproducing Japanese dishes in this world would normally be a highly ambitious endeavor.</p>
<p id="line_965">Well, that’s that, but getting back to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s grandfather.</p>
<p id="line_966">I clearly heard that he was an “Otherworlder” named “Byakuya Araki”; <em>perhaps he could’ve been someone from the Edo era? I don’t think he was a chef; I wonder just what era he was from.</em></p>
<p id="line_967"><em>Well, alright. It doesn’t really matter. For now, let’s just enjoy the night.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_968">There were a lot of people gathered around the buffet tables of the standing party section. The dishes were well received, and people were singing their praises. After all, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Yoshida pulled out all of the stops, so I just nodded, thinking that kind of reception was to be expected. In stark contrast, no one seemed to want to even touch the fish sashimi and sushi <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had prepared. They might have been intimidated after laying eyes upon the horrid sight of the spear tuna. But It seems like anywhere you go, there will always be those who want to appear knowledgeable, despite not knowing anything. You could hear people saying “Ah, could that fish be the Rank A…”</p>
<p id="line_969"><em>There’s no way that raw fish being served right after getting sliced would taste any good—I would like it if they stopped saying things they didn’t know and tried a bite instead.</em></p>
<p id="line_970">It was possible to check for poison in this world, so it surely didn’t come down to a fear of getting poisoned. They had jumped to the conclusion that it would be a lousy dish, due to the appearance.</p>
<p id="line_971">No one was willing to take the first step, leading me to seize the initiative.</p>
<p id="line_972">“I shall try it.”</p>
<p id="line_973">“Ohh, then please try this.”</p>
<p id="line_974"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made the effort to make me a new piece of sushi with the belly meat. I dipped it in soy sauce and took a bite. The strong scent of the wasabi and the buttery belly meat that melts in your mouth complemented each other spectacularly, exploding in a heavenly taste.</p>
<p id="line_975">Delicious…!!</p>
<p id="line_976"><em>It’s so delicious. I doubt the places in Ginza</em><span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="One of Tokyo’s top shopping districts, Ginza is packed with upmarket boutiques and ritzy cocktail and sushi bars." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> <em>could even keep up with this?!</em></p>
<p id="line_977">“It’s the best, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!!”</p>
<p id="line_978">“Of course. The fish that came in was so delightful, it had me worried that we wouldn’t have any left, however, it’s a pity that it hasn’t been well received. But I’m looking forward to the post-dinner drinks.”</p>
<p id="line_979"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s colleagues would have their meal after the guests left, so it seemed like they planned on saving some sashimi to go along with sake. It was unfortunate that the guests didn’t take too well to it, but if they were going to be picky about their food, that would be fine as well. Rather, it might’ve actually been what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and co. wanted and couldn’t be thankful enough for.</p>
<p id="line_980">However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s plan went up in smoke.</p>
<p id="line_981">“Could you make sushi with that belly meat and without the wasabi?”</p>
<p id="line_982">Someone turned up, making a comment that left me dumbfounded. <em>Not only did she ask for the belly meat from the start, but she even asked to remove the wasabi?</em></p>
<p id="line_983">“What are you, a kid?”</p>
<p id="line_984">“Shut up, I don’t like the burning sensation in my nose,” Was the arrogant retort coming from none other than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_985"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, wearing a simple evening dress meant to be worn outside, ordered the sushi like it was natural.</p>
<p id="line_986">“I would also like it if there was a wider variety of fish.”</p>
<p id="line_987">As if that wasn’t enough, she stepped it up with such a cocky request. Not only did she want the wasabi to be removed, but also more kinds of fish? Surely, the wasabi part could be a difference in preference, granted, it could be hard to handle for people trying it for the first time. I, too, asked to remove the wasabi when ordering, that is, until I was in middle school. But now as an adult, I believed that you could only say that you were eating it properly, if you knew how to relish the taste of wasabi.</p>
<p id="line_988">“What nonsense. That’s neither here nor there, all that matters, is that it’s delicious,” she smirked at me.</p>
<p id="line_989"><em>…But she</em> did <em>have a point.</em> <em>That damn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she fired back a logical response without a flinch</em>.</p>
<p id="line_990">Although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was like that, she received the plate <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was handing her with a broad smile on her face. She closed her eyes as she slowly placed the sushi in her mouth.</p>
<p id="line_991">“It’s really great. The sashimi, and the sushi as well… I’m a tad angry, but I respect you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_992">She seemed satisfied, savoring the belly meat to her heart’s content.</p>
<p id="line_993">“Then I would like one as well. Ah, I’m not a child, so you can include the wasabi.”</p>
<p id="line_994"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came by, following <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Seeing how he was dropping light, sarcastic remarks, he had likely been watching us from the start. Despite already having loaded up in the buffet area, his appetite remained unwavering. As he was receiving the plate from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he immediately shoved the sushi into his mouth and started chewing, as if he had been waiting for it.</p>
<p id="line_995">“Wow, it melts on your tongue! To think that I would be able to have sushi this delicious in this world, I’m slightly moved,” he said as he moved his hand towards the sashimi as well, beaming with glee.</p>
<p id="line_996">Seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> like that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also shot a sarcastic remark, “It sure tastes differently from freshwater fish.

<p id="line_997"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had said that she wanted to eat seafood dishes and had previously requested <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to transport it. But it proved to be too difficult, and facing far too many problems, so in the end, the request went unfulfilled.</p>
<p id="line_998">To get him back for the wasabi incident, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> brought up that topic.</p>
<p id="line_999">“There was nothing I could do? The sea to the north is inhabited by large beasts, so it’s too dangerous, and the south is unviable because of the distance. And transporting the fish from the inland sea is prohibitively expensive,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bitterly replied, with a troubled face and a wry smile.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1000">Yes. The market of this world was still fragile. Sure enough, as I expected, people who lived inland usually didn’t get the chance to eat freshly caught fish. It was because of the innate hurdles that made the transportation of seafood a laborious task. You could only transport small amounts with carriages and keeping them frozen was tricky. The only options were hiring a mage exclusively for this task or preparing large quantities of ice in each city. Even with all of that, it remained uncertain whether or not the freshness of the fish could be preserved throughout the journey from the coast to the inland cities.</p>
<p id="line_1001">If you weren’t among the fairly rich, the luxury of eating fresh fish would remain beyond your grasp. It was something entirely unthinkable to most.</p>
<p id="line_1002">Taking into account that dishes with steamed fish could be had, you could say that the problem came down to distribution. That issue was being improved upon like I had hoped. Seizing this opportunity, we could make the existence of luxury dishes exclusive to our country’s public knowledge. When the time would come, we planned to organize a logistics network, but until then, our country would monopolize it.</p>
<p id="line_1003">Perhaps it was the appearance of the spear tuna that made the guests reluctant, or maybe they were hesitating because of the disparity in food culture, but either way, there was still no one daring to touch the sushi and fish sashimi.</p>
<p id="line_1004">However, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were doing their part in flipping the public sentiment by showering the sushi with praise.</p>

This person was the head of the Pegasus Knights Dolf.</p>
<p id="line_1006">“Yes, alright. I shall bring it to you.”</p>
<p id="line_1007">In reaction to my words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s hands sprang into rapid action. Freshly made sushi, sashimi, and soups were lined up and served by the elven ladies. The dishes were placed one by one in front of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party, who were sitting in the tatami room.</p>
<p id="line_1008"><em>Now, let’s see how they react?</em></p>
<p id="line_1009">“—Hmm, this definitely is outstanding.”</p>
<p id="line_1010">“Kua, this is delicious!!”</p>
<p id="line_1011"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> ate sashimi while enjoying the cold, Japanese alcohol. And the feelings they expressed were those of amazement.</p>
<p id="line_1012"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> does, dropping all semblance of royalty as he was enraptured by his first time eating sushi. And the reaction of everyone at the table was the same.</p>
<p id="line_1013">“To think that that infernal fish could be this delicious!”</p>
<p id="line_1014">“Speaking of fish, I thought that frying it was the way to go…”</p>
<p id="line_1015">“Well, what does it matter as long as it’s scrumptious.”</p>
<p id="line_1016">“Every dish <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama provides is spectacular, without fail!”</p>
<p id="line_1017"><em>That’s a relief.</em> I was elated to find that everyone seemed satisfied.</p>
<p id="line_1018">And then—a lot of heads had turned to watch <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s company and saw their reactions.</p>
<p id="line_1019">“I, I too want to try that!” one person shouted, followed by a stampede of others, scrambling to order from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in a frenzy.</p>
<p id="line_1020">It became all the rage. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made a very slight happy expression, at the same time it was tainted with wistfulness.</p>
<p id="line_1021">I got where he was coming from. In this situation, he wouldn’t have any left to eat with sake later. <em>Actually, I have another spear tuna that I caught, so I should hand it to him later in secret.</em></p>
<p id="line_1022">After <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had a light quarrel, they voiced their opinions on things and argued while having a drink.</p>
<p id="line_1023"><em>I’m not sure whether they get along or not.</em></p>
<p id="line_1024">But at the end of the day, you could thank their quarrel for acting as a successful promotion. I didn’t want to bother them now and decided it would be better to thank them later.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1025">The banquet proceeded with minor incidents here and there. So far, it was a great success. Western and Japanese dishes, both were very popular.</p>
<p id="line_1026">Attendance of tonight’s party was voluntary, but, despite this, many people had participated.</p>
<p id="line_1027">I didn’t forget to imply that the food’s ingredients were in store for those willing to trade with us in the future.</p>
<p id="line_1028">In short, that was also part of the plan. My job was to subtly promote things this way. The purpose wasn’t merely to wallow in luxury. I wasn’t burning money to satiate my greed; it was just a thorough preparation for times like this!</p>
<p id="line_1029">—That was my excuse at least.</p>
<p id="line_1030">Anyway, that’s that. Even if I were to think of it that way, the banquet was proceeding as smoothly as planned, except…</p>
<p id="line_1031">“Bi-big trouble!!” a soldier rushed into the parlor house, shouting.</p>
<p id="line_1032">It seemed like a problem was afoot.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1033">Naturally, we had soldiers stationed around the parlor house. There were even the escorts of the prominent figures that came, all together it was very crowded outside the building.</p>
<p id="line_1034">Under those circumstances, the likelihood of the problem being a massive headache to solve was high.</p>
<p id="line_1035">“Why, what’s wrong?” I slowly asked to calm the soldier down.</p>
<p id="line_1036">I wanted to run out and check the situation, but I couldn’t show myself panicking as well—I spoke with that thought in mind. But before the soldier could even reply, the escorts from each of the countries came running in a panic.</p>
<p id="line_1037"><em>What is happening here?!</em> The security should have been airtight; if something were to happen, it would be very disgraceful.</p>
<p id="line_1038">I didn’t feel a big aura approaching us, and it wasn’t like a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had appeared either. If something like that had happened, we would’ve noticed it sooner. Milim and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s group seemed to be a bit late, but even if they did arrive, the soldiers wouldn’t have panicked. Then what exactly…</p>
<p id="line_1039">“A large flying object came flying outside the city!!” the soldier looking at me reported, soon to be drowned out by the escorts from other countries informing each of their masters.</p>
<p id="line_1040">“Reporting! The Sorcerer’s Dynasty’s Guardian Dragon King has appeared!!”</p>
<p id="line_1041">“B-big problem here! E-Elmesia Elaure <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the Emperor herself is coming down here right now!!”</p>
<p id="line_1042">“Her Imperial Majesty Elmesia and her entourage are approaching this location right now!!”</p>
<p id="line_1043">They all shouted in disarray, so I was stunned for a bit, but without having to put together all of the pieces I heard, it seemed like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s empress was just arriving late.</p>
<p id="line_1044">“Ah, don’t scare me like that. I was wondering what happened.”</p>
<p id="line_1045">I mumbled absentmindedly, which prompted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to rise from his seat and move beside me, with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p id="line_1046">“You’re the same as ever, carefree and without a clue how the world works. If the Divine Emperor Elmesia came out of her country, then it’s natural for this commotion to happen. The humans from each country and even I have to be careful and watch her complexion, if that divine empress is the opponent, then it would be hard to handle. Even the people who aren’t here right now must be panicking and sending messengers to their countries.”</p>
<p id="line_1047">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1048">As I asked for a more detailed explanation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> dove into it as if he had been waiting for the opportunity. <em>This guy, even if he talks a lot, I get the impression that he just wants to show off to me by expounding his proud knowledge. Either way, it was honestly a big help nonetheless, so I don’t really have any complaints, I thought while listening to the breakdown.</em></p>
<p id="line_1049">According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a superpower. It was one that held national power on the order of magnitude comparable to the Armored Nation Dwargon, without even participating in the Western States Council. And just like the name “Dynasty” implied, it was a federation formed by 13 royal families.</p>
<p id="line_1050">If you were to compare the levels of influence, the Western States Council was undoubtedly the most powerful. However, as long as they upheld the council system they adopted, they lacked the efficacy to take immediate action. Leveraging that flaw, Dwargon was, in contrast, an absolute monarchy under the rule of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, allowing it to exert more influence than the Western States Council, despite falling behind in total strength. Likewise, the same was true for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1051">“The empress of the Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Elmesia, holds absolute power. She calls herself a descendant of god and declared herself the divine empress. I don’t know the truth, but it is an undisputed fact that the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="high elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with the name Elmesia revived the country. So, that girl lived longer than <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s history.”</p>
<p id="line_1052">They were on fundamentally different levels. The Armored Nation Dwargon spanned 1000 years of history. Compared to that, the history of Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was known to go back at least 2000 years.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1053">“And so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, before Elmesia, even I can’t raise my head. Much more, to humans with their short lifespans, it’s impossible to even think of meeting her.”</p>
<p id="line_1054">Seeing how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> made a bitter expression, the person called Empress Elmesia must’ve been a very troublesome person to deal with.</p>
<p id="line_1055"><em>Uh-um,</em> I was planning to invite only Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>… I ended up calling the absurd bigwig as well.</p>
<p id="line_1056">“Ah, I see. I should have written proper names in the invitation.”</p>
<p id="line_1057">“…I don’t think that’s the problem here.”</p>
<p id="line_1058"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stared at me through narrow eyes; she had already arrived, it would be a fool’s errand to make her leave. I had no choice but to do my best to receive her.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1059">During our conversation, a commotion had been brewing at the entrance.</p>
<p id="line_1060">“Looks like they arrived.”</p>
<p id="line_1061">“Do not get careless, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Just think of her as a beast who’s been through all sorts of hardships.”</p>
<p id="line_1062">I took <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s insistent words to heart and prepared myself for an abnormal encounter. I looked at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and nodded firmly to show that I understood.</p>
<p id="line_1063">A great commotion broke loose inside the parlor house. Someone who you normally could never meet, no, not only that, the empress of a superpower, who had not shown herself for tens of years, appeared. I should say it was natural for others to be causing a ruckus.</p>
<p id="line_1064">Empress Elmesia Elaure <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Someone who called herself a divine empress, was confidently walking into the venue. An incarnation of beauty, was the thought passing through everyone’s head as they gawked, bereft of words, at Empress Elmesia.</p>
<p id="line_1065">I thought that as well. Because that appearance, no matter from which angle you looked, she was a beautiful girl. She had skin as white as freshly fallen snow, and soft, silver hair. Sharp, pointy ears and jade green eyes that seemed to see through everything.</p>
<p id="line_1066"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said she was a girl, so she definitely had to be female.</p>
<p id="line_1067">If she was a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="high elf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, then did that mean she was a pure-blooded fairy? Or she might’ve had blood that was infinitely close to pure. Calling her a fairy addresses too broad of a category, but they were said to be a race that evolved from great spirits, so this Elmesia standing before me seemed to be one of those ancient beasts from a time long gone. She was a big enough deal to warrant a warning from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1068">I also needed to remain vigilant of the guardians protecting the Empress. From each and every one, I felt extreme power, despite them wearing formal garments. It must’ve been magic armor, and this was just my guess, but they were legendary-grade. The power I felt emanating from those formal clothes was equivalent to the feeling I got from the Moonlight rapier <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wielded. Their skills would, naturally, be on equal footing with Arno and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. No, thinking about the quality of their weapons and armor, the Empress’s guards might’ve been superior.</p>
<p id="line_1069"><em>The world sure is big—</em>that thought passed through my mind.</p>
<p id="line_1070">Holding back one of her guardians from stepping forward, the Empress herself approached.</p>
<p id="line_1071">“I am thankful for the invitation. I am happy about it.”</p>
<p id="line_1072">A mellow voice—I almost mistook it for charm magic, but it wasn’t magic at all. It was simply her voice being that charming.</p>
<p id="line_1073">“I, too, am honored to meet you,” I answered in front of her, at which point I could see my own reflection in Elmesia’s jade green eyes.</p>
<p id="line_1074">«Notice. ‘Mind Interference’ detected—Interrupted. This doesn’t seem like an attack, just an effect of ‘Heroic Spirit’ that seeped out.»</p>
<p id="line_1075">This was dangerous. This person seemed to have a higher level of ‘Heroic Spirit’ than even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In other words, her strength was not only equal to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but there was a chance that she was able to top it.</p>
<p id="line_1076"><em>Maybe she’s a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> class?</em> It would be good not to be hostile towards this person. This was a peaceful invitation; I would try my best to appease her in the hopes of friendly relations in the future.</p>
<p id="line_1077">“Then, though it may not be up to standard, we have prepared meals as well. I hope you will enjoy yourself tonight.”</p>
<p id="line_1078">“Hmm, I am happy to receive such consideration from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. I expect a lot from the festival that will take place tomorrow, so please make me happy. And—“ she said with a leisurely smile, then brought her face near mine, and whispered in a hushed voice only I could hear, “It doesn’t have to be today, but I hope you can make time for me. There’s something I’d like to discuss with an open heart, in a less formal setting.”</p>
<p id="line_1079">That informal way of speaking must’ve been Elmesia’s true self. As someone who was still not used to being a stern and dangerous <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but had to play the part nonetheless, this made me feel a bit more intimate with her. And so, I answered: “Alright. I’ll contact you when the date is decided.”</p>
<p id="line_1080">Elmesia nodded with a look of satisfaction, then retreated to her guards’ protective circle.</p>
<p id="line_1081">And just like that, Elmesia gave a cute, entertaining smile to the people who were preparing to meet her for the first time, while walking towards the table laden with food.</p>
<p id="line_1082">On a side note, I was wondering why Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the person I initially invited, was nowhere to be seen, when I landed eye-contact with one of the Empress’s escorts. <em>No, wait a minute. That person is Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?!</em> He had such a gallant expression that I almost went past him, but anyway, he apparently had come along. We only caught a passing greeting by sight, but I thought that I should say hello to him later.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1083">It was a short conversation, yet a very tiring one. I was so exhausted that, while all eyes were on Elmesia, I snagged the opportunity to go and sit down in the tatami room. I thought tonight would be easy-going, because participation was optional, but a bigwig just had to show up.</p>
<p id="line_1084">“Yeah, I’m really tired.”</p>
<p id="line_1085">“I felt like I was gonna fall over the moment I met her. If I don’t keep my mind straight, that grand—”</p>

Then he mumbled a bit and ended up just drinking the cold alcohol.</p>
<p id="line_1087">Seeing as how I could feel a terrible chill coming from Elmesia, that was probably the reason. <em>I wonder what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was about to say?

<p id="line_1088"><em>Ah, whatever</em>, I’ll just drink for now.</p>
<p id="line_1089">I talked with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> about how the world goes around, and this and that, over some drinks.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1090">But our leisure time didn’t last long. Noticing how the entrance was starting to get noisy again, I could sense that another bigshot had showed up.</p>
<p id="line_1091">“Our guests have finally arrived.”</p>
<p id="line_1092">“Yes, it seems like they’re here.

<p id="line_1093">“Ah, it’s Milim-san. Seems like she’ll spruce up the evening.”</p>
<p id="line_1094">After having experienced it once before, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to be a little in over his head when it came to Milim.

He seemed a bit thinner, but I am glad he looked healthy.</p>
<p id="line_1103">Looking at the people following Frey, there were two beautiful twin girls. One had silver hair while the other had gold hair, which fit well together. I heard that they were attendants of Frey, called the Twin Wings. I didn’t know they were twins, but they seemed like strong ladies as well. These were rulers of extreme power who accepted Milim as their new queen.</p>
<p id="line_1104">It was hard for people to hide their nervousness, and I honestly couldn’t blame them.</p>
<p id="line_1105">“Sorry. I’ll have to excuse myself for a minute,” I said before leaving to meet Milim’s group.</p>
<p id="line_1106">Milim’s face lit up with a big smile as soon as she saw me.</p>
<p id="line_1107">“Huhuhu, this day finally came! I’ll expect dishes good enough to make <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shout from the rooftops today!” she announced for everyone to hear.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/illustrations/image5.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_1108"></p>
<p id="line_1109">“Ah, leave that to me,” I answered, then in a subdued voice: “But first of all, didn’t you get scolded?”</p>
<p id="line_1110">Milim often snuck into the dungeon whenever she managed to slip out of Frey’s sight. She was here until yesterday, so her arrival today was also later than planned. I was a little worried about whether she’d been found out and was being scolded by Frey.</p>
<p id="line_1111">“It, it’s okay. I became self-aware that I am a ruler, so I made Frey believe me by emphasizing that I was protecting my borders,” Milim replied in a small voice, claiming she had made Frey accept it.</p>
<p id="line_1112">Seeing how she was sweating bullets and her eyes kept darting back and forth, it didn’t seem like she fully convinced her… Frey had a keen intuition.</p>
<p id="line_1113">What Milim was protecting wasn’t her territory, but the floors of the labyrinth I assigned to her. If that was found out, I, who was wholly unrelated, might get scolded as well. I had no choice but to believe in Milim for now. But—</p>
<p id="line_1114">Even if Milim ended up folding, I could just cling to saying that I had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p id="line_1115">“Thank you for inviting us today. I sincerely apologize for being later than the scheduled time,” Frey came towards me with a greeting, after waiting for my conversation with Milim to end. Then she looked me in the eyes and asked as if it were an interrogation: “Our Lord, Milim, had gone missing until this morning. So it took time to get her changed into formal dress—”</p>
<p id="line_1116">“Ah, hahaha, so that’s it. Ah, I don’t mind, so please enjoy the next few days free of hassle.”</p>
<p id="line_1117">I got the feeling that she could see right through me, so I looked away and politely brushed it aside. Had I been in my slime form, there would be no signs of agitation. But right now I was in my human form, causing me concern over my line of sight betraying my real intentions.</p>
<p id="line_1118">I must not meet eyes with an opponent that had such sharp senses.</p>
<p id="line_1119">“—I will do so. To be invited, despite being indebted to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama for building our new city. I am very grateful,” she answered with a smile, which melted my anxiety away. Then, naturally, I ended up saying something potentially inflammatory.</p>
<p id="line_1120">“No, No. I would hope that the dishes are to your liking. Right, are there any ingredients that you don’t eat? There is a dish made with a bird, if that is a problem—“ Those words slipped past my tongue, before their meaning had caught up to me.</p>
<p id="line_1121">“A, bird…”</p>
<p id="line_1122">A freezing tension suddenly paralyzed me.</p>
<p id="line_1123"><em>I’m in big trouble</em>—but it was already too late.</p>
<p id="line_1124">“Ah—”</p>
<p id="line_1125">“Did <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama want to say that I am on the same level as a bird?”</p>
<p id="line_1126">“That, wasn’t my intention—”</p>
<p id="line_1127">Frey was still smiling, and the Twin Wings were seething with bloodlust.</p>
<p id="line_1128">I screwed up big time. The saying, “The mouth is the source of trouble,” fits me perfectly right now.</p>
<p id="line_1129">This was unbearable. That moment of suspense filled with worry.</p>
<p id="line_1130">“Pfft. Hahahaha! Amazing, truly amazing, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. You really are an amazing guy. To actually treat Frey like a bird, this is a masterpiece,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had burst out in laughter, looking like he couldn’t read the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="line_1131">“Hmm, it’s something even I can’t copy,” Milim said in admiration.</p>
<p id="line_1132"><em>Don’t do that, please don’t look at me with those sparkling eyes</em>.</p>
<p id="line_1133">“What’s so funny, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>? And Milim,” Frey huffed angrily.</p>
<p id="line_1134">No matter how you look at it, this was my fault.</p>
<p id="line_1135">“No, it was just my bad manners. What I just said was a slip of the tongue. I brought up a pointless concern, worrying that you might dislike bird dishes.”</p>
<p id="line_1136">It’s best to apologize truthfully in these situations. Stubbornly insisting on some irrelevant point could lead to a bigger argument. Based on this notion, I bowed my head and apologized in order to appease Frey, despite being in front of everyone. And I was met with surprise from Frey.</p>
<p id="line_1137">“Huhu, how befitting for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. You’re just as I expected. I knew that you didn’t mean to insult me, though I wanted to test, for a moment, how you would react. But this was very telling. That Milim will grow by your example,” Frey finished, this time showing a gentle smile from the heart.</p>
<p id="line_1138">Milim being a tyrant was a thing of the past. In spite of her current appearance, her tendency to listen to others had markedly increased. Thinking that the reason for that was me, she used my slip of the tongue to test me. And probably intended to let Milim learn from my attitude. Bowing immediately was the correct answer. As long as Milim followed my example, then from Frey’s perspective, of course she’d want to test me. If I had been a bad influence on Milim, then she would no doubt be limiting playtime with me.</p>
<p id="line_1139">This really made me see Frey in a new light. I thought she was just a scary lady, but she seemed to be looking after Milim well.</p>
<p id="line_1140">Then, if we were to talk about bad examples…</p>
<p id="line_1141">“Well, what about you, Ka-ri-on? What’s so funny? Could you explain it clearly for me to understand?”</p>
<p id="line_1142">An incredible pressure seized <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s head, strong enough to make cracking sounds. Frey turned to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in a flash and grabbed his head with her soft hands. In brute force alone, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was far stronger, but looking at grip strength on its own, Frey had the upper hand.</p>
<p id="line_1143">“Wa-wait! Ow, ow-ow-ow, that hurts, really!!”</p>
<p id="line_1144">Frey hardened her arm from the fingertips to her elbows. Her fingernails started to transform into knife blades that were stronger than steel, then continued to grow bigger and embedded themselves in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s head. It looked awfully painful.</p>
<p id="line_1145">“Dangerous, if this gets any worse, it will really be dangerous! I was wrong, I’m sorry, so please forgive me, Frey!!”</p>
<p id="line_1146">Their master was screaming, but the three <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Beastketeers" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did not try to move.

Well, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still had the strength left to scream. And unlike me, he didn’t seem to be reflecting, so it was a natural consequence of his actions.</p>
<p id="line_1147">“Did you see, Milim? You need to apologize when you make a mistake. That is the right choice, alright?”</p>
<p id="line_1148">“Hmm, okay. Before that, I will try to avoid doing things that will make Frey angry.”</p>
<p id="line_1149">Milim seemed to understand what I was saying. Playing in the dungeon was fun, but you must do it in moderation. First you finish the things you need to do, after that, leisurely playing around could be more fun. If you did that, you won’t have any trouble, so if you didn’t want to get punished like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, you needed to be careful.</p>
<p id="line_1150">“Wait, hey! Wait! Stop the idle talk and help me!!”</p>
<p id="line_1151">Seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> desperately struggling to break free from the claws as an example to learn from, Milim and I looked at each other and nodded.</p>
<p id="line_1152">“Hey, don’t ignore me.

<p id="line_1153">Pledging not to forget his sacrifice, Milim and I waited for Frey’s anger to subside.</p>

<p id="line_1158">“You’re fine, so stop complaining!”</p>
<p id="line_1159">“Yeah, Frey wasn’t super serious about it. That much was nothing, right?”</p>
<p id="line_1160">Because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was still so lively, I didn’t worry too much and told him that. But it was more dangerous than I thought.</p>
<p id="line_1161">“That’s not true? From the moment my head was caught in Frey’s claws, I lost access to my Skills. It’s probably her special Skill. To think that she would use that on me, this is no doubt an expression of her love.”</p>
<p id="line_1162"><em>You’ve got it all wrong</em>—but I kept that to myself.</p>

To teach our Milim-sama such blasphemy…”</p>
<p id="line_1167">The thing that came out of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s mouth, who followed as Milim’s attendant, as soon as the dishes were placed in front of him, was criticism. According to this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he was the representative of “the people who want to follow Milim,” in the letter Milim sent.</p>
<p id="line_1168">Hermes, who was sitting off to the side, was making either apologetic or prayer gestures directed at me. Maybe he was doing it because he was worried that I might get angry at what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said. He seemed like the type that didn’t neglect to worry about the small things, a pleasant guy.</p>
<p id="line_1169">The nobles were watching us from afar, they had already filled their bellies and were enthusiastically talking about the ways of the world. Even if they were talking about the current affairs, their sphere was the world of aristocrats, and the goal was information collection. Right now, they seemed to be more interested in our conversation, than their own stories. In other words, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Milim and her associate’s reactions, and the dishes they felt were good, that was what they were curious about. Especially since there were people like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who didn’t understand the luxurious life of humans in the first place…</p>
<p id="line_1170">There was nothing to talk about when traditional values were vastly different, but if we gave up that easily, then getting humans and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> closer together would be hard—there were likely people coming to that conclusion. There was nothing we could do about that, but it would probably be okay this time.</p>
<p id="line_1171">Hermes, another one of Milim’s attendants, said that he wanted to spread the concept of cooking to the Worshippers of Dragon, therefore, I responded to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with confidence.</p>
<p id="line_1172">“Blasphemy, you say?”</p>
<p id="line_1173">First, I countered with another question to figure out what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was thinking.</p>
<p id="line_1174">“Hmph! To be thankful and enjoy the taste of nature at its purest, that is the proper way, the rule we had set in stone long ago. To do this to them…”</p>
<p id="line_1175">There was dressing on the salad. The potato salad was mashed and devoid of round shapes.</p>
<p id="line_1176">“And what exactly are you doing? Cooking the meat, that’s fine. But to then tarnish the meat by pouring an unknown liquid on it? Pathetic. This deed is truly pathetic!!” he bellowed while glaring at me with throbbing veins on his forehead, he must’ve been furious.</p>
<p id="line_1177">Seemingly irritated after hearing that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who had prepared the meal, stared at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with an eerie smile. Hermes, noticing the intimidating atmosphere, went pale as a sheet and bowed to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in apology without end.

<p id="line_1178">“To show such insolence to the gifts of nature! It doesn’t matter if you do as you like in your territory, but it is nonsense to rope our Milim-sama into this as well!”</p>
<p id="line_1179">While jabbing a finger at the soup filled with ingredients and the bite size cream croquette, among others, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was persisting on his views of it being an insult to the natural ingredients. This was ridiculous, it’s no wonder Milim asked me for help.</p>
<p id="line_1180">These kinds of people were always tiresome to deal with, talking sense into him would be hard. He seemed like the type of guy that thought himself to be infallible and disregarded anything other people said. However, that would come to an end today.</p>
<p id="line_1181">It would be a problem if their tongue structure were different, but this was solely a conflict with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s values. And he simply believed it to be true, there was no legitimacy behind his ideas. In the first place, Milim herself, who <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> served, wanted to eat delicious dishes. Even now, she looked like a dog that had been told “wait,” while there was food in front of her, so let’s settle this quickly.</p>
<p id="line_1182">This time it would be an easy victory.

But I was being too simplistic.</p>
<p id="line_1183">“I can never accept something like this!!”</p>
<p id="line_1184"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was furious and didn’t want to touch the meal.

<p id="line_1185">Milim was eyeing me anxiously.</p>
<p id="line_1186">Hermes looked to the skies with a crestfallen expression.</p>
<p id="line_1187">The dispute had gotten slightly out of hand and seemed to have drawn a lot of eyes.

<p id="line_1189">“My apologies. Our High Priest has been rude. He does have a bit of a temper on the regular, but he isn’t a bad person… I didn’t expect him to get this bent out of shape over food.”</p>
<p id="line_1190">“Uh-um. I naively thought that he would understand once he tried the food. It’s not good to force it either, so there’s nothing we can do…”</p>
<p id="line_1191">Well, it wasn’t like today was our only shot at this. The festival started in full swing tomorrow, so there was no need to rush.</p>

<p id="line_1208">“How is it? It’s delicious, right? This is what we call ‘harmony.’ Just like each and every one of the ingredients in the soup limiting their self-assertiveness can bring an overall complete taste, this soup contains that desire.”</p>

<p id="line_1211"><em>No, that’s obvious.</em> Compared to totally raw vegetables, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s cooking being far better was obvious.

<p id="line_1212">“Hey, if you could stop looking at us with those pitiful eyes, that would be great…” Hermes said with a bright red face. His attitude clearly portrayed that he was asking not to be treated at the same level.</p>
<p id="line_1213">Certainly, I understood why he wanted to say that. After all, there are superiors who refuse to listen to their subordinates, even when they make a good point. Nevertheless, when something happens, then they have joint responsibility, making things tricky.</p>

<p id="line_1231">“It’s so delicious!!”</p>
<p id="line_1232">A face full of smiles.</p>
<p id="line_1233">A reply like that was obvious. You didn’t need fancy words, her face said it all.</p>
<p id="line_1234">“I see… I had the wrong idea… Does that mean Milim-sama had waited for me to realize my mistake all this time…”</p>

<p id="line_1236">“Now, now, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, being disheartened will only make the people around you uncomfortable.

<p id="line_1237">He was not able to read the mood—no, because Hermes said that, purposely acting oblivious, veins started to show again on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s forehead.</p>

<p id="line_1242">And the place was filled with laughter.

<p id="line_1243">“Your little sister is really amazing.”</p>
<p id="line_1244">“Right? She’s my proud little sis.”</p>
<p id="line_1245">As I complimented <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> while meeting eyes with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, he nodded saying that it’s only natural. Maybe because she heard our conversation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> dashed to the corner of the parlor house with a bright red face.</p>
<p id="line_1246">After that, the eve that was planned to go from six to nine in the evening, was extended for two more hours. One of the reasons being that key figures who were hesitating to participate, attended with the news of Elmesia turning up. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s group were quite the heavy eaters, so satiating their hunger took a while, that being another reason.</p>
<p id="line_1247">Well, whatever the reason was, it didn’t matter. Judging by the unprecedented results, it was a huge success.</p>
<p id="line_1248">And with this, the eve together with multiple promotional efforts aimed at prominent figures from other countries, despite some diversion that brought us off course a few times, but, nonetheless, had exceeded expectations, finally came to an end.</p>

<p class="no-indent" id="line_1250">After the pre-party ended, the time was twelve at midnight. We held an emergency meeting.</p>
<p id="line_1251">“Sorry to have to summon you all this late. Surely you are all very tired by now, but I hope you all can hold up for just a while,” saying so, I glanced around the people gathered. First, I wished to commemorate the biggest hero of today’s event, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

The food was truly delicious, and you also helped convince that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who has been troubling Milim as well.

<p id="line_1253">After expressing my gratitude towards her, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave off a sweet smile.</p>
<p id="line_1254">“That was too kind of you, it’s all thanks to Yoshida-san’s help that the meals turned out to be such a success.

I was quite troubled and felt that my culinary skills weren’t as good.”</p>
<p id="line_1255">Whether it be fillet, fancy-looking sashimi, and even hand-made sushi, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s culinary skill far surpassed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s. It’s not that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t trying hard enough, it was just his unique craftsmanship… Though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> still seemed rather troubled by it. With that being said, she candidly accepted my thanks, nonetheless.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1256">Next, I turned to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who was quietly working behind the scenes.</p>

Were there any issues?”</p>
<p id="line_1258">In order to sell things during the event, we imported a variety of goods from different countries. It was being managed by Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lilina" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.

<p id="line_1259">“The merchants gave very positive feedback. They were all astounded by the majesty of our nation. The food provided by our residents tonight also made a great impression on them. Many farmers from neighboring countries also visited us. It was an unprecedented sight to behold.

<p id="line_1260">At this time, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> turned his eyes slightly to Rigurd. He nodded in response and continued the explanation.</p>
<p id="line_1261">“Indeed, as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san mentioned, there have been many goods, such as fresh vegetables, fruit, dried meat, dried fish as well as precious artifacts gathered here. Not to mention, some have even brought livestock, so the preparation for the celebration is water-proof at this point.”</p>
<p id="line_1262">Rigurd guaranteed that there was no need to worry about the adequacy of the products.</p>
<p id="line_1263">“We’re planning to start using these imported goods as food ingredients for the nightly gala from tomorrow onwards,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lilina" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san added, after nodding to Rigurd’s words.</p>
<p id="line_1264">“Right, so there doesn’t seem to be any problem.”</p>
<p id="line_1265">“Yes, there shouldn’t be any problem. It’s just that—no, there shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
<p id="line_1266"><em>Hmm? <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wanted to say something.

<p id="line_1267">“Oi oi oi, don’t hold back and say it already! It’s really bugging me that you stopped mid-sentence.”</p>
<p id="line_1268">I tried to get <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to come clean. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to approve of my view as well and nodded in agreement. Unable to withstand this pressure, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> scratched his head and opened up once more.</p>
<p id="line_1269">“Perhaps I’m just worrying too much, but the vendors that came with the well-known merchants were all unfamiliar faces. Despite the impression I may give to others, memorizing people’s faces is my specialty. So that really caught my attention. That’s why I had it look into—”</p>
<p id="line_1270">Even though he was concerned, there shouldn’t be an issue. That’s how <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> put it. From shop-owners he was acquainted with, he learnt that they were indeed only trading with these people recently. But they hadn’t heard anything negative about them. These people were offering quality goods at low prices, and the shop-owners all jokingly commented that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was worrying too much. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tried talking to these people to probe their intentions and they also responded rather kindly.</p>
<p id="line_1271">“I’ve been too excited having taken this important responsibility that even I am a bit on the edge,” he finished with a wry smile.</p>
<p id="line_1272">Recently, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s workload had reached jaw-dropping levels. I was a bit worried and asked whether he could hold up.</p>
<p id="line_1273">“Oi oi oi, are you sure you’re gonna be able to hold yourself together? You’re not going to force yourself too much and fall into illness…?”</p>
<p id="line_1274">Yet this time <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did indeed dismiss my worries with a smile.</p>
<p id="line_1275">“Hahaha, please don’t worry. As opposed to this, there’s more important things to attend to!

<p id="line_1276">He was full of passion towards this job, so this was no time for him to quit. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> declared himself.

<p id="line_1277">“Right, that’s why I’ve gathered everyone here.”</p>
<p id="line_1278">The people who went to receive Milim and the others weren’t aware of this ordeal yet. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> even eyed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, asking “What is going on here?” hoping to hear an explanation from him.

<p id="line_1290">“Not at all; don’t you act reckless now,” I repeatedly warned him.</p>
<p id="line_1291">Then I proceeded to discuss what I was actually planning.</p>

<p id="line_1301">—And so on, these reactions were as I expected.</p>
<p id="line_1302">The only one who did not respond was Ranga, who had been slumbering in my shadow. I won’t allow him to participate anyway, so there shouldn’t be an issue.</p>

<p id="line_1307">“WHAT!”</p>
<p id="line_1308">“What do you mean—”</p>
<p id="line_1309">I held up my hand to quiet the shocked crowd as I explained to them the rationale.</p>
<p id="line_1310">“First of all, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, aren’t you the “Covert Spy”?

He seemed to agree and said no more. He no longer insisted on participating. Thankfully, he wasn’t stubborn and asked to participate in disguise. But just to be safe, I had another bit of leverage.</p>
<p id="line_1312">“As a result, I want to give you a new role title.”</p>
<p id="line_1313">“A role title?”</p>
<p id="line_1314">“Indeed. Since you have been in charge of the espionage activities of the nation, I now officially appoint you as the leader of the royal spies.

That was really just an excuse for him to not participate, although it was good that he also felt so happy about it. Nowadays his troops had reached around a hundred members. He only needed to pick out the elites to form the “Shadow Squad.” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was able to accept that kind of arrangement. The problem now lay with the other three.</p>
<p id="line_1317">Among my subordinates, these three were the strongest. If I allowed these folks to participate, there would no doubt be problems everywhere. I was aware of the consequences, so I’d already come up with a solution.</p>

<p id="line_1353">“Unfortunately, I am unable to participate due to security duty, but there’s a man whose strength is only next to me, that is—”</p>
<p id="line_1354"><em>Someone strong enough to stand next to Rigur—could it be!</em></p>

<p id="line_1356">Oh… Saw it coming. As I expected, Rigur had given his highest approval.</p>

<p id="line_1358">“Hehe, that guy is among the best of my disciples. He’s got a quick mind as well as good techniques. Although he hasn’t evolved in terms of raw power, it’d be interesting to have him grow with this tournament.”</p>
<p id="line_1359">Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was saying so. None of the lieutenants seemed to object. I would like to confirm his willingness in person, however…</p>
<p id="line_1360">“Zzz—Zzz—”</p>
<p id="line_1361">Uhh. It seemed that the participant was eager to fight as well. No problemo. <em>So it shall be</em>, I decided to send <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> into the tournament.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1362">And just as I was about to end the meeting, someone had a word to say.</p>
<p id="line_1363">“Master, I would like to join in the martial tournament!”</p>
<p id="line_1364">Ranga woke up at some point without my notice and stretched his neck out of my shadow. He had commented while wagging his tail.</p>
<p id="line_1365">“No no no, Ranga, surely you’re not suitable. The theme this time is martial combat, after all…”</p>
<p id="line_1366">“Y-you have a point, the Summoner is joining the battle, so there should also be summoned beasts… But it would be pretty odd to have Ranga-san join the tournament…”</p>
<p id="line_1367">The tournament was a battle of strength and technique. Ranga was indeed strong, but he didn’t fit in accordance with the rules of the tournament. Based on these views, I rejected his proposal. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also expressed approval.</p>
<p id="line_1368">Ranga looked at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hatefully. He seemed upset, but that was a point I couldn’t compromise on. I steeled my heart and refused Ranga from participating.</p>
<p id="line_1369">“Then we should arrange <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san as the seeded participants. The number of participants has exceeded two hundred, we will have them group in six teams to partake in elimination matches. Then we will decide on the official participant.”</p>
<p id="line_1370"><em>Over two hundred!</em> There were quite a lot of people participating. The preliminary rounds tomorrow were originally supposed to select eight final official participants of the tournament. But we couldn’t spend too much time in the preliminary matches, so we planned to split them into eight teams to fight in elimination rounds. Now that we considered the two joining the tournament, it became a match of six.</p>
<p id="line_1371">“I’ll be receiving guests from other nations tomorrow, so I’ll leave the commanding post to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, sorry for the trouble!”</p>
<p id="line_1372">“Just count on me!”</p>
<p id="line_1373">Hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reliable voice, I nodded reassured.

<p id="line_1374">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, are you acquainted with all the foreign journalists?”</p>
<p id="line_1375">“Yes, I’ve invited them to participate in the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

Now that we had been covered by the media, there was no need to hide our strength. In other words, perhaps having a fearsome <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="demon" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as referee—such contrast may more or less change people’s impression of him.</p>
<p id="line_1377">“Sorry about it, I didn’t want to trouble you with the referee role. But since the Chosen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> are joining, it doesn’t feel safe to have a hobgoblin as referee.”</p>
<p id="line_1378">“Kufufufufu, please leave it to me!”</p>
<p id="line_1379">And so it was done. If anything happened, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would definitely help.</p>
<p id="line_1380">“That’s it for now, sorry for taking up your time. It’s a bit late, but everyone can relax for the day!”</p>
<p id="line_1381">“ “ “Yes sir!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_1382">Now the meeting was finally over. And so, we went to bed before the official start of the actual ceremony tomorrow.</p>

<h1 class="ch-number">Chapter 2</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span></h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_1384">After meeting the representatives of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> living in the Great Jura Forest, the talk with the representing group from the Western Nations went smoothly as well. There were many more details to discuss in the future, but the ideas brought up in our discussion were a good start.</p>
<p id="line_1385">Last night we held a rare founding eve celebration. The event concluded peacefully with the various attendances from guests all over the continent.</p>
<p id="line_1386">I was very satisfied. I seemed to only have to talk to people I’d been acquainted with in the past yesterday. In terms of actual agreements and demands, I ordered Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to document all of them. They even stopped guests in secret to prevent them from chatting with me.</p>
<p id="line_1387"><em>Very impressive. They’re truly men I can count on.</em></p>
<p id="line_1388">To be honest, had someone directly negotiated with me, there was a good chance that I’d screw up and end up getting myself lumped into something I shouldn’t have. If that were the case, we could have been held accountable for something in the future. Their buffer-zone really helped me out.</p>
<p id="line_1389"><em>That being said, if I am able to establish good relationships with other nations in the future, I wouldn’t really mind helping ‘em out a bit… But for now, it’s best we act with caution until we can ascertain their true nature.</em></p>
<p id="line_1390">I couldn’t just roll over and simply acquiesce to their requests.</p>
<p id="line_1391">Regardless, right now we were still lacking in manpower. We still had tons of work left to do even after we concluded the festivities. There were a lot of pending issues to attend to.</p>
<p id="line_1392">Practicality aside, even if we were to moderate and establish relevant departments, we still wouldn’t have had enough people to fit in administrative roles. And I couldn’t just pile on more work for the existing people either, or else they truly would be busy forever.</p>
<p id="line_1393">Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> far exceeded my expectations. Their due diligence on all the work I assigned them had at times caused me to be a bit over-reliant on them. I also invited them over last night, despite things being hectic as they were, causing them to lose some sleep. I need to avoid becoming dependent on them—this was my conclusion I reached following the emergency meeting we had last night.</p>
<p id="line_1394">As such, I had decided to take on some responsibility as the ruler of this nation and do my best to receive the guests.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1395">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of Tempest would be held today, under a sky as clear as crystal.</p>
<p id="line_1396"><em>Even if it rains, I’ll just blow the clouds away,</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p id="line_1397">This was the capital of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, a city crowned with my own name. The location was the meeting hall in the center of the northern district, where most political institutions resided.</p>
<p id="line_1398">I glanced down upon the people gathered below. The streets leading to the meeting hall were packed to the brim. They were once unruly <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but they were now my citizens and regarded as demi-humans.</p>
<p id="line_1399">The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s from all over the Jura Great Forest had congregated here before me. With them were also merchants from neighboring nations as well as adventurers bodyguarding them.</p>
<p id="line_1400">Moreover, there were also peasants that came for the festival. From what I saw below, the total population here numbered over one hundred thousand, and we had become a huge melting pot of races. A sense of fulfillment gradually filled my heart as I realized that we had finally achieved a kingdom where humans and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could peacefully coexist—feels good man.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1401">Next, it was about time. I stood up and held the microphone in my hand.</p>
<p id="line_1402">“Everyone, I… I mean, I (<em>royal sounding</em>)…am the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>…”</p>
<p id="line_1403"><em>Umm, whatever goes. This is too troublesome.</em></p>
<p id="line_1404">To me, delivering a serious speech was not only just a difficult task, but also a burdensome responsibility. That’s why I decided to just put forth my honest emotions.</p>
<p id="line_1405">“I am <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and it’s nice to meet you all. Well—thank you all for coming to my kingdom upon invitation. I am very pleased. Although for some of you guys it might be your first time visiting, please rest at ease. While it is indeed a fact that I have become the new <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I have no intention of antagonizing humans. I simply wish to build a kingdom where everyone can live in harmony. As opposed to fighting each other, I believe humans and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> should cooperate. I believe only in this way can we build a better future.”</p>
<p id="line_1406">I observed everyone’s reaction as I continued my speech. It seemed that everyone was intently hanging onto my every word. This not only applied to citizens of our kingdom, but also to the peasants that came for the celebration. I continued:</p>
<p id="line_1407">“Some may be wary of the fact that I am a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. While this sense of caution is understandable, I hope everyone would put trust into your genuine feelings. I won’t force you to accept my views. It would certainly be pleasant if you were to find me trust-worthy, but even if you are not willing to trust me, it is something that cannot be helped. Trust is not built overnight, but rather through persistent communication in the future, which is a conclusion that I shall not rush towards—”</p>
<p id="line_1408">As the saying goes, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Things like trust need to be nurtured over time. However, how the people interpreted my message was entirely up to them. Next, I addressed the royal ruling classes:</p>
<p id="line_1409">“Fellow nobles gathered today, I hope that you will relay what you see and hear here today honestly when you return to your respective nations. Some kingdoms have already established diplomatic ties with us. Even if you can’t put your faith in us, will you not find those nations trust-worthy? I hope that you will not be prejudiced simply for the fact that I am a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_1410">With that being said, this wasn’t something they could determine by themselves. It had to be a decision made by the nation as a whole. What everyone thought here wasn’t that big of a deal, but… I still wanted to believe that there was some use to say these things.</p>
<p id="line_1411"><em>But I’ll need to give them a fair warning, so we don’t end up with a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> 2.0.</em></p>
<p id="line_1412">“I won’t wage war against you simply for the fact that you did not cooperate with us, but if you treat us unfairly due to our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> status, or attack us with the intention of invading: that is something we absolutely will not tolerate. I figure that everyone here has an idea about what I’m talking about after seeing what happened to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom.”</p>
<p id="line_1413">These were my genuine thoughts as well. Perhaps some would consider me as a threat for doing so, but those were just my honest opinions. I disliked war, but if anyone dared to invade our kingdom, I would retaliate without hesitation. An indecisive ruler will only bring about harm, especially for innocent civilians.</p>
<p id="line_1414">After all, ensuring the lives and properties of our citizens was the responsibility of the state. It was my primary objective to protect, and that included friendly <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as well as future immigrants. A world without military conflict was nothing but an idealistic dream. A citizen had every freedom and right to dream about peace and prosperity, but that wasn’t a luxury rulers could afford. They needed to always be on their feet, ready to handle any situation that may arise. This was the bare minimum for a nation to function. That was my justification for the speech I just delivered to the higher-class guests.</p>
<p id="line_1415">And to wrap it all up—</p>
<p id="line_1416">“Whether you’re a merchant, adventurer, or peasant, I swear not to lay my hands on common civilians. But that does not apply to criminals. Our country is lacking in manpower. As such, there are plenty of jobs available, so anyone who wishes to fill an empty role can consider immigrating. Naturally, with more people come more opportunities. Here, you will have freedom of speech and the ability to choose the occupation that you desire. But even so, please speak and act responsibly. If you are still interested in our nation after my speech, please consider my proposition. There are all sorts of events planned for our nation in the future as well. Today’s Tempest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is but the first debut project. With that being said, I hope everyone will have fun!”</p>
<p id="line_1417">After that promotional message to the commoners, my speech concluded.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1418"><em>Was that a bit too on the nose?</em></p>
<p id="line_1419">Oh well, I didn’t really mind. I was just a clerk working nine-to-five in my previous life, which is why my speech was nowhere near as eloquent as those delivered by kings and nobles despite my quick rise to fame.</p>
<p id="line_1420">But, even with that being the case—</p>
<p id="line_1421">The crowd exploded into deafening cheers. My citizens aside, even the visitors were in an uproar. Although there must also be people who still had their suspicions, most people were willing to trust me and put their faith in this nation. That would do for now. It would be odd to have complete trust from the get-go. Our heartfelt thoughts had been delivered to everyone. All that’s left was to see their reactions.</p>
<p id="line_1422">And so, with my speech, the Tempest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was officially commenced.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1423">After the speech, I made my way to the main hall on the ground floor. The children had finished dressing up and gathered there.</p>
<p id="line_1424">“Sensei turns out to be the king of this country?”</p>
<p id="line_1425"><em>Hmm? Did I not mention it?</em></p>
<p id="line_1426">“So, you didn’t know, Kenya? Since you are now aware of my greatness, it’s never too late to show me a tad bit more respect.”</p>
<p id="line_1427">“What did I—”</p>
<p id="line_1428">“Yeeees! I respect sensei a great deal!”</p>
<p id="line_1429">As I was teasing Kenya, Alice interrupted and hugged me. Chloe followed up with a “Me toooo!” and similarly sprung on me.</p>
<p id="line_1430">I smiled, patting both their heads before gently pushing them away. The two seemed rather displeased since, after all, I only had one body. They’d just have to suck it up for now before they started arguing amongst themselves.</p>
<p id="line_1431">“Speaking of which, this is quite a surprising turn of events. Just yesterday I was guessing whether sensei was a king or not…” Gale said as Ryota nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_1432">“Ahh, this whole king thing was after I parted ways with you all. By the way, I have been really busy lately.”</p>
<p id="line_1433">“R-right… Of course, you’d be really busy after becoming a king…”</p>
<p id="line_1434">Kenya still looked very pissed, but at least it seemed he was willing to forgive me a little.</p>

<p id="line_1528">With all those features, it was no wonder why the dress would be pricey. Even with the production of silk stabilized, the supply was still scarce. And of that scarce supply, even fewer were finished products. Given that to be the case, we could only sell them at an incredibly high price. It was a product tailored for nobles and not meant for the commoners.</p>
<p id="line_1529">I heard that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> bought it without hesitation upon seeing it yesterday. She even had someone custom tailor it. I figured that she must have spent a good load of money on it. Well, if that were the case, I couldn’t complain about such a good customer.</p>
<p id="line_1530">“I guess it’s possible that her spending mood is related to the festivity? She was also quite eager to explore things around here yesterday as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1531"><em>Are you serious?! And I thought that I was just seeing things…</em> It seemed that peoples’ expectations towards the Tempest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had gone beyond my imagination.</p>
<p id="line_1532"><em>Ah, I guess that’s why she said those things</em>. Based on these considerations, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided to take a break herself and pushed the duty to receive <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to me.</p>
<p id="line_1533">“What was she investigating yesterday by the way?”</p>
<p id="line_1534">“The food stands. Wasn’t she just animatedly talking about chow mein and corn on the cob?”</p>
<p id="line_1535">“Oh, so she did…”</p>
<p id="line_1536"><em>That means <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> has indeed done her thorough research.</em></p>
<p id="line_1537">She seemed to take enjoying the festival very seriously. Any wariness she may have had was gone with the wind, fully immersing herself in the festivities.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1538">Indeed, we had lots of fast food stands on display outside the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Colosseum" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and among them was one that I had personally planned. Everything went very smoothly with the help of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s arrangements.</p>
<p id="line_1539">We offered hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, and a panoply of juices. There were many other shops as well. We had stands that offered chow mein, corn on the cob, cow-deer BBQ, and snacks. Even though it might have been off season, we even had shaved ice for sale. It would definitely become a best seller during the summer. Shaved ice was thin, delicate, and it melted in your mouth. Now just add some sweet syrup on top of that… I had tried it before, and I could definitely vouch for its fantastic taste. The aromatic smell of soy sauce combined with the sweetness of fruit sugar was mouthwatering.</p>
<p id="line_1540">This was all possible thanks to everyone’s careful preparations for this day. I communicated my memories of the dishes through ‘Telepathy Net,’ and as a result, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the others were able to successfully recreate them. With <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> doing the planning, my projects were able to come to fruition. Even more surprising was the fact that we made it so that Veldora could open a teppanyaki shop.</p>
<p id="line_1541"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have checked out stores beforehand and had made her plan to tour around the town.</p>
<p id="line_1542">“By the way, she seems pretty different compared to how she normally interacts with people. Does she really like eating junk food that much?”</p>
<p id="line_1543">“I mean, who doesn’t? It tastes good. I’m a fan of junk food too, so you can’t really just judge her like that…” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed as I was mumbling to myself.</p>
<p id="line_1544">I had stumbled upon a rather surprising side of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and I wasn’t sure whether I could call that a blessing or a curse. At least she wasn’t stingy with her money, so she should be a good client.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1546">Accompanied by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I arrived at the guest hotel. Rigurd was already explaining the planned schedule to the large group of nobles gathered there.</p>
<p id="line_1547">“Oh, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama! Your speech just now was truly wonderful!”</p>
<p id="line_1548"><em>Eh, really?</em></p>
<p id="line_1549">Rigurd’s joyful expression was contagious. He provided me reassurance that my speech just now was perfectly fine. I exchanged smiles with Rigurd all the while thinking to myself, <em>nice, nice!</em></p>
<p id="line_1550">“Then, we will be leading everyone to attend the first event of the day!”</p>
<p id="line_1551">Rigurd began walking as he finished. He moved towards a building near the hotel. It was the opera house. We managed to redecorate the interior on a crunch, and the end result was more majestic than what we had hoped for. We only arranged these high-quality chairs in this particular manner after considering the acoustic effect in the theatre.</p>
<p id="line_1552">The guests were seated properly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1553">The standard of culture in this world was a bit lower when compared to Japan. This was…umm, a genuine observation even from other people’s point of view. While there was a relatively high artistic and musical achievement, that was limited to royalty and nobility. They were entertainment for the upper echelon that had both an abundance of money and time. The angels would assault any city that developed past a certain threshold. As a result, most aspects of advanced culture were tucked away in the realms of the privileged. To the nobles, these forms of culture were merely considered as minor entertainment. But to me, culture was something that required a collective effort to build together.</p>
<p id="line_1554">Geniuses had been buried in this world. It was not only difficult to discover the genius in these fields in a world with such a narrow view, but they may also even be buried and eventually not be developed for their entire lives. Art is the product of entertainment spawned from extra vitality of life, and the same goes for any innovation.</p>
<p id="line_1555">In this world, the search for such things is a luxury, but I’m not giving up because of it. I will, however, search the world to discover the geniuses that were overshadowed by the average people. In order to achieve this, first I need to foster a culture appreciation trend within my nation.</p>
<p id="line_1556">And the first step is—today’s appreciation concert. There were plenty of musical instruments in this world that were similar to my original world. To my surprise, there was even something like a piano.</p>
<p id="line_1557">And these were all discovered at Clayman’s base. He seemed to have been living life no worse than court royals. In one of the countless luxuriously decorated rooms of his, he had stored a large number of instruments. Some <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> already understood music. They seemed to play beats to the performance of flute and taigo<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Japanese drum instrument" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>. They also had a culture of holding festivals every year. I loaned instruments to these people and, with time, their talents here and there blossomed.</p>
<p id="line_1558">We prepared instruments for those conscious of learning, and gave them basic instructions such as teaching them how to read music notes.</p>
<p id="line_1559">My knowledge alone was hardly enough, and it was a time like this that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would shine. With the music schoolbook from Japan combined with the knowledge related to instruments within the library of this world, we produced a paper book. How amazing(-ly terrifying) it was for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to recreate such long-forgotten knowledge of mine.</p>
<p id="line_1560">The personal effort of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came next. As the saying goes, “Interest is the best teacher,” soon enough, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> started to master their favorite instruments.</p>
<p id="line_1561">By the way, I also had someone faithfully recreate the music notes. I wasn’t someone qualified with traits such as “pitch perfect hearing,” but it was no problem for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. Not only did it recreate the sheet music, it even re-composed the songs. Although I was worried about copyright issues, there was no JASRAC<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Japanese Society for Rights of Authors" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span> in this world. Moreover, the rights holders were not here either. <em>So please give me some leeway for wanting to further foster the culture.</em></p>
<p id="line_1562">Our powerhouse was comprised of violinists, but there were also instruments such as the trumpet and kettledrum. While it was surprising to see that there were pianos, how easily the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> played them moved me quite a bit.</p>
<p id="line_1563">The opinion on whether to add a piano into the orchestra was split. But this alone was not enough to concern me too much. If we wanted to further dramatize the performance with the addition of a piano, we should just add it in. I wasn’t musically talented, so the decision was handed to the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. The result of the performance was guaranteed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1564">Today was also the first day I would be hearing their performance. With mounted expectations, I nervously awaited the moment.</p>
<p id="line_1565">After confirming that the guests had been seated, the lights were gradually turned down. The curtain on the stage was pulled up. Members of the orchestra in uniforms emerged. The ensemble was made up of people from different races as they held their preferred instruments. Some looked like humans, others looked like beasts. There was a lot of variety. Everyone’s face was filled with confidence and pride in their instruments.</p>
<p id="line_1566">A halfling came to the front, likely the conductor, and bowed deeply to the audience—I recalled this young man sighing that he couldn’t do anything. I told him as comfort that “There’s no such thing.” Even though he wasn’t good at accounting, his weak physique made him unsuited for construction work and he wasn’t cut out for farming either. When out of options, he went to be enlisted, but he couldn’t win in a fight either.</p>
<p id="line_1567">While this was the case, he was good at raising morale. His singing voice was most beautiful and united the people. That’s when I recommended him to the army band. I had even given him the name “Taktstock”—</p>
<p id="line_1568">Taktstock then raised his face. Unlike his expression from before, his face was now filled with enthusiasm. As he graciously subjected himself to the judging eyes of the high nobles, he turned his little back to everyone. A small and fragile body, but his back was full of strength.</p>
<p id="line_1569">Everything happened so quickly. These people were lucky that their talents were developed.</p>
<p id="line_1570">He raised his taktstock (conductor baton), and the next second—they began to perform. A steady tone started, and soon was followed by a change into a solemn reprise.</p>
<p id="line_1571">Under the conduction of Taktstock, the performers were acting in unison. They had also found things to be proud of. The music they were performing seemed to be announcing: “This is the best moment of my life.” It was mesmerizing.</p>
<p id="line_1572"><em>Classical music, these are famous songs that can be recognized in any era no matter where. There are songs that heal, that inspire joy and determination. These are songs crafted by many geniuses.</em></p>
<p id="line_1573">These people, who could barely read, studied these notes day and night—and today at this hall, their effort blossomed, and they performed music with their heart and soul. Nowadays, they would no longer be mocked and called useless trash. <em>If someone actually does that, I’ll beat the shit out of them. That’s how good their performance is. I had been to classical concerts a couple of times when I was in Japan, and you guys are not doing bad at all.</em></p>
<p id="line_1574">I didn’t expect to hear such high-quality music here.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1575"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> closed his eyes and listened while reminiscent about the past, he seemed mesmerized by it. <em>How about that, aren’t they amazing</em>—I couldn’t help but feel smug.</p>
<p id="line_1576">But just as I thought so, the music stopped abruptly. They then continued to play some very familiar anime songs.</p>
<p id="line_1577"><em>No way, hold up… That was an almost natural transition from classical music to an anime song! And then it somehow transitioned to pop music.</em></p>
<p id="line_1578"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> opened his eyes and stared at me with a deadpan look. <em>Quit it already, I’m not the one responsible here.</em></p>
<p id="line_1579">And the culprit that used my memory to compose songs—</p>
<p id="line_1580">«Answer. These are songs I’ve selected from master’s memory bank that evoked relatively high satisfaction.»</p>
<p id="line_1581">—This answer filled with confidence came from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san.</p>
<p id="line_1582"><em>Now I’m gonna carry this for the rest of my life.</em> The good atmosphere we just managed to create had been destroyed completely.</p>
<p id="line_1583">I did like these songs, but it was too drastic of a contrast when it was played right after some serious music.</p>
<p id="line_1584"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to agree. A small, wry smile emerged on his face.</p>
<p id="line_1585">With that being said… It seemed only <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I felt that way. I guess this was to be expected. The audience were all hearing these songs for the first time. They had no clue where they were from. Moreover, with the clever tweak of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, the songs were composed perfectly. Naturally, people wouldn’t suspect a thing.</p>
<p id="line_1586">Whether it was people who were used to listening to famous songs or not, they all probably heard these songs for the first time, and some were really into them.</p>
<p id="line_1587">The orchestra’s music surrounded and dominated the music theatre, the people in the audience didn’t even risk making a sound by blinking; they were fully concentrated. Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, as well as music composed by unknown geniuses had mesmerized the nobles and royalty alike in this world.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1588">The concert today was quite the success. The <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were able to perform beautiful music—today, anyone who listened to the concert, would have to acknowledge that.</p>
<p id="line_1589">That included the anime songs. After hearing the version they performed, they were just as great as the famous historical pieces. Even the pop songs did too, they were truly mind-blowing, and the rock songs were morale boosting.</p>
<p id="line_1590">The enthusiasm in the theatre was still very high—and soon, the performance ended.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1591">It was over now. The past hour sure was something else. It was almost like the moment had been immortalized.</p>
<p id="line_1592">As planned, the performance would come to an end. According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation, there would be one hour of public performance each day in the morning and afternoon. Some people who were not familiar with music may find listening for too long to be insufferable. Based on these considerations, we shortened the duration.</p>
<p id="line_1593">There was no intermission. This was our first attempt at it, in order to proceed things quickly, we simplified some steps. And the concert just now was the result of it.</p>
<p id="line_1594">I only needed to listen to the reports. The people in front of me were the ones that figured out all of this. I felt honored as I stood up, hoping to give them my congratulations to their success.</p>
<p id="line_1595">As I was about to clap—</p>
<p id="line_1596">Taktstock bowed to us and swung his baton. All the lights suddenly went off. The theatre hall became dim, some people seemed to be panicking. But that was only for a second. Someone was standing on the stage, as a slim film of light shone down.</p>
<p id="line_1597">She was a petite young girl with light pink hair—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She had an unusual charm today as she was dressed in a white open shoulder dress. I had only seen her in her kimono, which even made me doubt “Is this really her?”</p>
<p id="line_1598">Surprisingly, under the thin light stood a purple-haired beauty as well.</p>
<p id="line_1599"><em>Is that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?</em> She wasn’t in her usual suit, but an off-shoulder dress. As if she were bathed under the moonlight, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s silhouette was dream-like. The lighting change made her dress, looming in the dark, give off a rare sensation of sexiness. Without speaking up, she was a beauty with an incredible body. Such a presentation had made <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> especially seductive.</p>
<p id="line_1600">Under the light, the two stood at the front of the stage as they bowed deeply. This alone was like a painting, drawing the eyes of the audience—but, speaking of which, what were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> going to do?</p>
<p id="line_1601"><em>Could it be…</em></p>

<p id="line_1603">I suddenly recalled the travesty that was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s cooking. <em>What if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s performance is so horrible that it makes things difficult for us later</em>—no, it shouldn’t come to that.

Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was very confident about it. That man seemed to have bet his life on this project, there’s no way he would let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> do whatever she wanted.</p>
<p id="line_1604">I needed this confidence. Upon thinking so, I closed my eyes. Although there were still worries within me, I awaited the performance to begin.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1605">The sound of the piano was calm and smooth. It was accompanied by the passionate play of the violin like flame. The nature of the song suddenly changed. Rather than a duet, it was more like a duel.</p>
<p id="line_1606">—But, beautiful, nonetheless.</p>
<p id="line_1607">It’s as if the tone reflecting the bad temper of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was being surrounded gently by the piano notes that reflect <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s temperament. Tender yet exciting, the two characters intertwine and support each other. Their incorporation was just right.</p>
<p id="line_1608">Ah ah, this was amazing. It’s as if my soul was being shaken as I was overwhelmed by the rich music. That was something else. There’s no way they could have reached that level of mastery by practicing on the spot. It must’ve been skills practiced since childhood.</p>
<p id="line_1609">Speaking of which, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a miko-hime (witch princess)—I heard that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was responsible for protecting her. During religious celebrations, music was a necessary component. It must have been for this reason that the music <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> performed was so strikingly impactful—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1610">There was silence. As if a momentary stay in a fantasy land had just finished. I felt as though I’d been there for an eternity, yet it had barely been five minutes. Upon coming back to my senses, I wanted to clap amidst panic, but I was overtaken.</p>
<p id="line_1611">There was a sprinkle of soft applause that broke the silence. Someone did it before me. I was gonna clap first, but someone got ahead of me. I clapped alongside to confirm who it was—I didn’t expect it to be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That gave me a spook. She had disguised herself as the maid of the two <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s and was clapping with utmost satisfaction.</p>
<p id="line_1612">I followed up with some intense applause, joined by many others. There was applause like thunder. Emperor Elmesia of the Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="dwarf" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the aristocrats of the Western Nations joined along. Even Frey and Hermes, as well as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who seemed remotely unconcerned with any culture. Everyone stood up and gave them their applause.</p>
<p id="line_1613">For some reason, the habit of applauding seemed to be the same as my original world. <em>Is it that there are so many “Otherworlders” from the start, or is it that this is just how this world is? I’m not really sure about it, but I’m sure there’s no culture of “Encore” in this world.</em> After all, cultural activities were a rare occurrence in this world, and the reason was very obvious.</p>
<p id="line_1614">And so I thought that everything was over, but it didn’t seem this way. The stage turned dark once more before the light shone again. The last song was performed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> on the piano, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> with her violin, as well as the rest of the orchestra. This concluded the public performance.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1615">Music—and art—can break through any barrier.</p>
<p id="line_1616">After witnessing it all, I would like to believe that there were indeed good things in this world, their beauty being something anybody could appreciate.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1617">The performance was a great success. At noon, we dined at the hall of the guest hotel. As the guests were eating snacks prepared by us, they were passionately discussing the performance from before.</p>
<p id="line_1618">“That was amazing.”</p>
<p id="line_1619">“Aye, you’re right about that—”</p>
<p id="line_1620">“I was even mesmerized with my eyes closed—”</p>
<p id="line_1621">“Me too. There’s still an echo of the music around. It didn’t matter if it were humans or <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that performed, there’s no difference between the two at all!”</p>
<p id="line_1622">“Indeed. Good things are intrinsically good, nothing else really matters.”</p>
<p id="line_1623">And so on, as I eavesdropped nearby, hearing everyone’s praise.</p>
<p id="line_1624">“E-excuse me…Lord <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I wanted to attend that music concert again, how could I have the chance to do that?” someone decided to just ask me directly.</p>
<p id="line_1625">“Throughout the three days of celebration, it will be held at fixed times every day.”</p>
<p id="line_1626"><em>That’s the answer I gave at least, but I may consider arranging regular concerts after the celebration.</em> There still weren’t many songs that they could play, but we would add on to the list in the future.</p>
<p id="line_1627">“They did a wonderful performance. I had a lot more fun than I had imagined,” when I crossed paths with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, she said so in a volume that only I could hear. I felt that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seldom gave praise, so her praising them directly this time could probably be interpreted as praise of the highest order.</p>
<p id="line_1628">Seeing the reactions of the crowd, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also looked very proud.</p>
<p id="line_1629">“Speaking of which, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was really surprising.”</p>
<p id="line_1630">“That’s right. But—despite her look—she has always been good with rhythms. That instrument called violin was a great fit for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave me a surprise with that instrument as well, she already enjoys singing, so it’s not that big a surprise after all.”</p>
<p id="line_1631">In <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s view, these seemed to be facts that could easily be accepted. He knew that the two had good singing voices. Having been reminded by him, I did recall hearing them singing joyfully. Although I seemed to have understood, I wasn’t actually sure about what everyone was truly capable of.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1632">The lunch gathering concluded, followed by the tech presentation in the afternoon. I followed Rigurd to guide the guests who had yet to calm themselves from the exciting experience in the morning.</p>
<p id="line_1633">Just passing by the opera house, we moved towards the museum this time. It felt as if we had gotten to the wrong place, but the historical records room was our destination this time.</p>
<p id="line_1634"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vesta were welcoming us at the entrance of the building. Some of the guests seemed to be aware that Vesta used to be a subject of the Dwarven Kingdom. A wave of noise came through, sounded like a commotion of surprise. But Vesta didn’t seem to mind as he laughed alongside the crowd. Under the two’s guidance, we entered the building.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1635">“What’s in the box here are the healing potions first produced by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. It was a liquid refined from hipokute grass. The refinement rate was up to 99 percent. It is not as good as a resurrection potion, though it is almost as authentic as one—”</p>
<p id="line_1636">Vesta explained as we walked further into the building. It was at this point that I discovered a misstep. While Vesta’s explanation was in detail, it was probably pretty boring to the people without the relevant knowledge. It was possibly for this reason that some had begun to feel bored.</p>
<p id="line_1637">The arrangement of the event was not ideal either. Had the tech presentation been arranged in the morning, the crowd would probably still attend out of curiosity. And it would appear less tedious. But arranging it right after the amazing concert in the morning, the presentation in comparison would, therefore, be dull. Moreover, considering that most of the guests are aristocrats, they may have been interested in the outcomes, but the production process would appear less significant. This must’ve been on their minds. Vesta seemed to have noticed this as well, as a wry smile emerged on his face.</p>
<p id="line_1638">“My, my, it must be tedious for everyone to listen to these abstruse topics. Let us switch things up and take a look at our experiments.”</p>
<p id="line_1639">He turned to signal <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1640"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded in response.</p>
<p id="line_1641">“This experiment is—to ask the rudimentary question of ‘What exactly is the healing potion.’ When we dilute the full healing potion to one-fifth of its concentration, we will have the higher healing potion for treating severe wounds. A little more dilution and we will be able to produce twenty bottles of lower healing potion. In other words, that’s just how incredible the full healing potion is.”</p>
<p id="line_1642">As Vesta was explaining, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> laid out all three types of healing potions in a line.</p>
<p id="line_1643">“If there’s any wounded person, we can invite him to test the effect of the potion. But deliberate self-harm would be too barbaric. So we’ve come up with an interesting experiment as an alternative.”</p>
<p id="line_1644">Accompanying <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s presentation, Vesta took something out—a broken sword.</p>
<p id="line_1645">“Next, will the healing potion be able to fix this sword, can anyone answer this question?”</p>
<p id="line_1646">As soon as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, someone snickered at his question.</p>
<p id="line_1647">“Impossible! hipokute grass only works on creatures!”</p>
<p id="line_1648">The respondent seemed to be a sorcerer, likely a court mage of some kingdom. He seemed to be well acquainted with relevant knowledge to determine that a healing potion had no effect on a broken sword.</p>
<p id="line_1649">“Kukuku, indeed you are right. That is at least the case for the higher and lower healing potions—on the sword, they would have no effect,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded in response.</p>
<p id="line_1650">That was only natural. You didn’t need an experiment to know the answer. <em>I can see <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asking it, but why did Vesta continue with the question—?</em></p>
<p id="line_1651">“Then, what is the range of its effective targets? What would be the answer to this question?”</p>
<p id="line_1652">To this question, the audience started arguing along the lines of “Do you think we are stupid?” and started making a fuss to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vesta. While such a reaction was expected, they were really being noisy.</p>
<p id="line_1653">But I could understand their sentiments. However, regarding the application range of the healing potion… Of course it was not limited to humans, it was effective for animals, plants and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1654"><em>Then, what really is the difference?</em> Upon thinking so, that did make me ponder. <em>Is it a difference between being organic and inorganic?</em> No, my guess was that it had to do with having will or not.</p>
<p id="line_1655">«Answer. Plants have wills as well, it stems from its “Soul.” Speculation is that the difference has to do with the spirit particle that makes up for magicule, i.e. the presence of “Soul” or not.»</p>
<p id="line_1656">Yeah, that. Plants have wills as well. Although they have no clear concept of self, they still desire to live. But a sword does not have “Soul,” in other words, possesses no will. A sword is purely just an object, and of course—<em>uh, hold up?</em></p>
<p id="line_1657">Something strange just crossed my mind. I recalled that Kaijin mentioned that a sword had its own will—</p>
<p id="line_1658"><em>Could it be!</em></p>
<p id="line_1659">“Kukuku, that’s the question I hope to explore as well. We’ve come to discover something new out of curiosity on the matter.”</p>
<p id="line_1660">“Indeed. I was laughing to myself at how stupid <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san was and told him not to do such a silly experiment, trying to stop him. But I was the ignorant one. I was too accustomed to common sense that I forgot my purpose as a researcher.”</p>
<p id="line_1661">Vesta, with a smile, poured the full healing potion on the broken sword. And soon, while only just a bit, the sword was reacting.</p>
<p id="line_1662">“ “ “…!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_1663">“This is the answer. While it is not complete regeneration, the broken sword does show signs of restoration.”</p>
<p id="line_1664">“H-how could this be…”</p>
<p id="line_1665">“Unbelievable. So, healing potion can be applied in this way—”</p>
<p id="line_1666">The guests couldn’t hide their shock, as was to be expected. Their common sense had just been devastated. It was hard not to feel surprised—I was shocked as well.</p>
<p id="line_1667">I didn’t expect them to conduct such an experiment. Neither of the two persons responsible reported it to me, leading to my unexpected and unnecessary shock right now.</p>
<p id="line_1668">“However, this only applies to gear that has grown to a certain extent. The basic requirement for the weapon is that it is made of ‘Magisteel.’ In addition, if the owner has not used the weapon for a long time, there will be no reaction.”</p>
<p id="line_1669">I see, in other words, it does not work if it does not possess will.</p>
<p id="line_1670">“—What prompted your interest in the matter?”</p>
<p id="line_1671"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> opened up quite seriously and asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1672">“It’s not anything special, to be honest. I used to think that wild plants and grass had no will, but after experimentation, I discovered that healing potion works on them as well.”</p>
<p id="line_1673">Since full healing potions were already being mass-produced, there was a surplus in terms of production. That’s why they were able to spray plenty of it on different materials as an experiment.</p>
<p id="line_1674">Indeed, curiosity is the first step to new discoveries. I recalled a similar experiment done at a science lab when I was in primary school. I also wanted to challenge myself a bit due to boredom. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the same, anything would come after the action.</p>
<p id="line_1675">The potion was effective towards plants. It was said that it could revive an almost dead tree and grow new branches over the broken ones.</p>
<p id="line_1676">“This reminds me of the dryads in this world. Could the seemingly weak plants before us not grow to powerful <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the future? On second thought, I believe there must be some other conditions.”</p>
<p id="line_1677">As the explanation reached this point, at least half of the crowd became intrigued. Normally speaking, such research results should have been kept secret. That fact must’ve been in the back of everyone’s mind.</p>
<p id="line_1678"><em>Should I let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vesta continue the presentation?</em> This thought quickly went through my mind before I dismissed it and continued to listen to the explanation with the rest.</p>
<p id="line_1679">“Any entity that reacts to healing potion possesses magicule. And items without magicule do not react at all… This means that will is something that exists in magicule—or the two are closely connected.”</p>
<p id="line_1680">“Yes. I’ve changed my mind since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san showed me the files. It was then that a question came to mind—‘What is magicule?”’</p>
<p id="line_1681">Magicule—one of the unique substances of this world that, like oxygen, existed in every corner of this world. It was the source of all amazing powers in this world, and to some extent it could control free will…</p>
<p id="line_1682">“Here’s a sample of a certain plant. Let’s switch to a different location and have a close-up image.”</p>
<p id="line_1683">After being hurried by Vesta, we moved on to a different venue.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1684">This was a large room with lines of chairs set up. This seemed more like a multimedia room. An experimental projector was set up there in front of a wall with a white cloth as a screen.</p>
<p id="line_1685"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was observing the projector excitedly, but he seemed to know that it wasn’t the focus at hand, so he kept his mouth shut. As expected of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, a mature adult that read the room.</p>
<p id="line_1686">After confirming that all guests had been seated, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began operating the projector. The device possessed light-magic engravings. It was a treasure that could project colored images. The room turned dim as images emerged on the white cloth.</p>
<p id="line_1687">Some people were very surprised to see this, but Vesta ignored them and continued the explanation.</p>
<p id="line_1688">“Then, please take a look at this image. This is the dissection of the aforementioned plant, and there is another dissection graph of a random grass—”</p>
<p id="line_1689">The two enlarged dissection graphs were displayed next to each other.</p>
<p id="line_1690"><em>He didn’t mention what type of plant it is on purpose, what is Vesta’s goal here?</em></p>
<p id="line_1691">“—Aren’t these two the same thing? I couldn’t tell the difference…”</p>
<p id="line_1692">“Uh—same here, I can’t tell the difference.”</p>
<p id="line_1693">Many people agreed.</p>
<p id="line_1694">While some pointed out that “Here’s something different,“ “No, over there,” but I guessed none of them were right.</p>
<p id="line_1695">“Alright, so what’s the correct answer?”</p>
<p id="line_1696">“Then let us enhance the image further.”</p>
<p id="line_1697">“How about now, does it still look the same?”</p>
<p id="line_1698">Vesta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave off a rather devious smile.</p>
<p id="line_1699">It was then that they began to reveal their ace in the hole.</p>
<p id="line_1700">“The first image is the plant known as hipokute herb. The second is a random grass we picked by the road. How about it then, do they look the same?”</p>
<p id="line_1701">As Vesta finished, people with pertinent knowledge began to disagree with him.</p>
<p id="line_1702">“They do look different. You can see the difference if you pay attention!”</p>
<p id="line_1703">“How devious of you Vesta-san. It’s so hard to see the difference between the images like this!”</p>
<p id="line_1704">The audience began to express their views.</p>
<p id="line_1705">The hipokute herb was rare. It was the grass that I ate inside the sealed cave of Veldora. It was also the famous ingredient that produced healing potion.</p>
<p id="line_1706">The dissection graph looked very similar to that of the grass. How could that be possible—that’s probably the average persons’ reaction. Including me, some had become shaken by the words of Vesta. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was among them, his face looked quite shocked.</p>
<p id="line_1707">The dissection graphs of the hipokute herb and grass were the same—this suggested that both <em>were</em> the same thing. Then, what even was a rare herb? The common sense of this world had been completely subverted…</p>
<p id="line_1708">While the devious smile still hung on Vesta’s face, he spread his arms to have everyone’s attention.</p>
<p id="line_1709">“Please, everyone, calm down, calm down.”</p>
<p id="line_1710">Vesta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> comforted the guests and quieted them down. As the room was back to silent, they continued to play the images.</p>
<p id="line_1711">“The liquid extracted from hipokute herb mixed with magicule will become healing potion. The nature of the refined liquid determines the rate of the fusion, that is a fact that everyone knows. Regarding the point, while I can’t give you the details, we’ve managed to extract liquid with purity up to 99 percent. The medicine made from it is the full healing potion.”</p>
<p id="line_1712">They were displaying a series of images while hiding the key technology. Vesta also explained the production process of healing potions.</p>
<p id="line_1713">“Then there’s the leaves of the hipokute herbs. When you grind them up and mix in magicule, you can produce ointment that can be applied on wounds. However, its effect is not as obvious. Because it is considered the remains of the refined extraction. You will obviously get such a conclusion from a certain point of view.”</p>
<p id="line_1714">A picture of the leaf was projected on the screen.</p>
<p id="line_1715">When you ground up these leaves and mixed them with the refined extract, you could make ointment. When he showed the steps of production, there wasn’t anything odd, I wasn’t sure what Vesta was up to now.</p>
<p id="line_1716">“Next, I’ll direct everyone to look at this image.”</p>
<p id="line_1717">The screen showed some ordinary grass that looked like the hipokute herb grown in the cave. Its appearance looked completely different, so how come the picture of its dissection was the same…</p>
<p id="line_1718">But after switching to a few different pictures, the image of hipokute herb began to change.</p>
<p id="line_1719">“Has anyone noticed yet? I found it purely by accident. While I was growing hipokute herbs under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s order, I came by some leftovers of the herb’s refinement waste. Even if we make them into herbs, as soon as our preservation method is not good enough, its effect would disappear. Moreover, compared to the juice of the healing potion, its effect is very low. Since these leftovers have always been prepared in one way, I’ve not paid any attention to it in the past. But back then, I thought carefully and realized that there’s really no need to specifically make it into ointment. I kept on pondering as I observed the leftovers—”</p>
<p id="line_1720">It was then that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> discovered something.</p>
<p id="line_1721">That was the shape of the leftovers’ leaves. They were different from the hipokute herb they grew. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was shocked and decided to keep a detailed record of it, which were the images he showcased.</p>
<p id="line_1722">“—First, in terms of theory, technically speaking, there is no such plant as hipokute herb. It was the high concentration of ‘magicule’ near its surrounding that caused this particular plant to mutate—”</p>
<p id="line_1723">“Indeed! It was not that hipokute herb grows in areas with high magicule concentration, but that only in areas with high enough magicule concentration can its mutation take place. That is the true identity of the hipokute herb!”</p>
<p id="line_1724">As <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> concluded his explanation, Vesta continued excitedly. No wonder he was so thrilled. The audience was riled up as well after hearing their speech.</p>
<p id="line_1725">“T-this is a major discovery!”</p>
<p id="line_1726">“Something like that, how can you publish that in a p-place like this, Vesta! Y-you need to find a more appropriate venue… You need to contact the universities and publish something like this by formal procedure!”</p>
<p id="line_1727">Noises abrupted at the scene and the situation was almost chaotic. Even those who were lacking in interest could not keep silent. As for the people who were intrigued from the start, the impact on them was even greater. The content of this showcase was beyond their imagination. From their exclamation that “You shouldn’t have published it in a place like this—“ alone could you deduce just how shocked they felt. Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s eyes were popping out in awe. Emperor Elmesia was also whispering with Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1728">I was scared as well. I hadn’t paid much attention to it until now, and was immediately brought to speed by their presentation. Now that I thought about it, this made a lot of sense. I didn’t think that there was all that hipokute herb in Veldora’s sealed cave from the start. If it were mutation—the plant itself evolved—then it would have made sense.</p>
<p id="line_1729">These plants returned to their original state as ordinary grass when all of its magicule was extracted through the refinement process. When it is completely depleted of magicule, its dissection graph naturally looks just like your garden variety grass.</p>
<p id="line_1730"><em>I see, that’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought of using a healing potion to fix the sword</em>. Just as any ordinary grass could be turned into hipokute herb, minerals could be turned into magisteel ore. These ores could then be refined into “magisteel” and could be used to craft weapons. Therefore, he would naturally question whether healing potions could be effective on swords or not.</p>
<p id="line_1731">The result of which was the demonstration at the start of the presentation.</p>
<p id="line_1732">“As for my question ‘What is magicule?,’ there has not been any clear answer. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="majin" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s are also affected by magicule. That is a known fact. But what about demi-humans? Is it possible to make them human by extracting all the magicule from their body? Questions similar to these started pouring into our heads, but proving any of these would prove to be extremely difficult.”</p>
<p id="line_1733">“With that said, we will carry on with our research. There are many researchers gathered on this land, we promise to continue our search for the answer. And with that, our tech presentation today is concluded.”</p>
<p id="line_1734">“Thank you—”</p>
<p id="line_1735">“ “—for listening, everyone.” ”</p>
<p id="line_1736"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vesta concluded the presentation together. It seemed that they had prepared the presentation very discreetly. They acted very natural as if they’d done this many times.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/illustrations/image7.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_1737"></p>
<p id="line_1738">Moreover, the content of their presentation was fascinating.</p>
<p id="line_1739">Even though there was no clear conclusion, the content was worth pondering over. They managed to announce something so important without revealing any of the core information on the matter.</p>
<p id="line_1740">The most important point was that through a presentation, you couldn’t really steal any of our technology.</p>
<p id="line_1741">Magicule could cause changes to plants—that was some wonderful information, but other nations may not have been easily able to research the matter. Perhaps they could run experiments, but even with the knowledge at hand, they couldn’t produce hipokute herbs in mass. Our nation would still take the lead.</p>
<p id="line_1742">Moreover, experiments conducted in our nation would be continued. There would be many researchers and intellectuals gathered on this land—just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, we will have many scholars gathered here to study. Because of our abundance of magicule, we could do however many experiments as we pleased.</p>
<p id="line_1743">This tech presentation had landed quite the impact on our audience. In the morning they were enjoying amusing sensations through music, and in the afternoon, the tech presentation excited their desire for exploration. As for which of the two was more memorable, that would be up to each person’s own judgement. But with both events stirring up such attention, it meant that we were very successful in holding them both.</p>
<p id="line_1744"><em>And I was thinking that people may find it boring and the arrangement was all wrong… Looks like it was for nothing.</em></p>
<p id="line_1745">This was the way to keep our guests’ attention on our nation—this goal was successfully reached.</p>
<p id="line_1746">I really wanted to praise those two without reservation.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_1747">After the presentation, it was free-roaming time. Some went to the salon for a rest, some snuck out to the market district. Some went to enjoy the hot spring or visit one of our entertainment facilities. We did send receptionists alongside guests so they could move at will.</p>
<p id="line_1748">As for what the guests were discussing, it was all about the concert and the tech presentation. Their praise was spreading around the town.</p>
<p id="line_1749">I went around and checked on the nobles for fun. It was then that Arno and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Bacchus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> caught up to me nervously. They whispered to me “We have something to discuss with you.” I suspected it was something urgent, so I returned to the guest hotel alongside <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and them to one of the rooms.</p>
<p id="line_1750">The one waiting there was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_1751">I had half guessed that it was her, having seen how nervous Arno and the others looked. <em>Looks like my guess was right.</em> She was crossing her leg while sitting on a chair in her maid suit. The black stockings on her pale legs looked very sexy. Arno and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Bacchus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stood up straight behind <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> without a flinch. This scene of master and servants looked very strange, but I suppose it was acceptable. It probably had to do with how majestic <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked.</p>
<p id="line_1752">“Well, though I did make a nonaggression pact with you…that was far from sufficient,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> immediately said as she saw me.</p>
<p id="line_1753">I didn’t even get the chance to respond—or rather, I didn’t get the chance to even sit down. I knew that she was an acute person, I didn’t know just how acute she was. While somewhat dumbfounded, I sat down without asking. And I immediately questioned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> back.</p>
<p id="line_1754">“Far from sufficient of what exactly?”</p>
<p id="line_1755">“Do I really have to spell it out? Exchange! Don’t you see that we can’t have much exchange at all now with the nonaggression pact?”</p>
<p id="line_1756">“No, I don’t think that’s really a problem…?”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1757">I tried to figure out what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was <em>actually</em> trying to say while trying to clear the situation. Holy Empire <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Tempest Federation had indeed signed a nonaggression pact just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pointed out. The Western Saints Church that served under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would also help with our status among the Western Nations. This had given us much convenience, but in terms of exchanges, we were indeed not in any alliance. Since the two nations were too distant from each other anyway, there was no trade between our nations. The flow of goods was left to the opportunities in the market, determined by the merchants and the strength of the nations. However, it’s not that we were not making any deals at all. I had actually requested <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to send travelling merchants to them.</p>
<p id="line_1758">Not to wait for their attempt, instead, we were going to strike first.</p>
<p id="line_1759">Basically, we had to do some investigation of the market there. Right now, I had gotten the investigation report for the specialties of the Holy Empire <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. I learnt that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a huge agricultural nation. They mainly produced wheat-based crops. They seemed to also be exported to the Western Nations. I also ran investigations of the products themselves; the quality was good and the taste was delicious.</p>
<p id="line_1760">That was our current situation.</p>
<p id="line_1761">I hoped to have some deeper exchange with them, but if you asked me what to do now, I really couldn’t come up with anything.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1762">“Are you seriously that stupid or are you trying to bait me?”</p>
<p id="line_1763">“No no no, that’s not what I meant.”</p>
<p id="line_1764">I immediately denied it. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sighed rather anxiously.</p>
<p id="line_1765">“Speaking of exchange, how about we try culture first? Seriously, I have really underestimated you guys. The people under the protection in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Lubelius" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> lacked artistic talent, so I didn’t have much expectation at first, but the concert just now was truly wonderful. With the whole day’s tour, I’ve changed my view on you guys.”</p>
<p id="line_1766">Haha, and she gave us a five-star review. She did also praise us when passing by me just now, it looked like she really liked the things we had. Moreover, I had gotten an idea of what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was going for. She recognized our ability after hearing the concert today. There also seemed to be a band under <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s rule, perhaps she wanted the two bands to have some exchange to encourage each other.</p>
<p id="line_1767">“Some vampires also possess artistic values. They’ve inherited music from ancient times and have been working to innovate on new songs. Lately they’ve been stagnant in that regard, so I think it would give them some good stimuli in the form of an exchange with your people.”</p>
<p id="line_1768">As expected, her proposal was actually hugely beneficial to us as well. Experience can fulfill one’s mind. If we wanted to host even better cultural events, the best way for us to grow and learn was through exchange with others with the same profession.</p>
<p id="line_1769">“That sounds good! Exactly what we want in fact.”</p>
<p id="line_1770">I had no reason to refuse and agreed without hesitation. Considering the future relations between our nations, there was more boon than bane.</p>
<p id="line_1771">“Um, let’s discuss more in that direction.”</p>

<p id="line_1773">It so happened that an old butler came forth to serve <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and me some red tea. His name seemed to be Gunther. He was just as strong as Louis, but also an experienced butler. Although our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> certainly wasn’t any inferior, I did have to say that the butlers in this world seriously couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p id="line_1774">Servants also began to prepare drinks for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> behind me.

<p id="line_1775"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s eyes turned coldly at the servants; and just when I thought to myself “Talk about an absolute master-servant relationship”—</p>
<p id="line_1776">“How wonderful, now you guys can have some fun too,” She told her servants arrogantly.</p>
<p id="line_1777">The servants responded with “All thanks to your grace,“ “I am looking forward to it!” They seemed genuinely joyful about the fact. I sensed that they were not afraid of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but holding great respect towards her.</p>
<p id="line_1778">Confused, I checked more carefully and discovered that these were all vampires. Every one of them suppressed their strength and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="youki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to appear no different than humans.

Surely by the few people at the scene now alone, they could take down a nation with ease. And to think that these people were her servants, this was enough proof as to how unfair power came into play in this world.</p>
<p id="line_1779">“Then Gunther, help me with the procedure back at Night Garden.”</p>
<p id="line_1780">“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p id="line_1781"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded as she sipped on her red tea.</p>
<p id="line_1782">She elegantly did so without making any sound, her beauty and elegance could be a model for royalty.</p>
<p id="line_1783">“By the way, that tech presentation was very interesting as well. What an intriguing thought to analyze the effects of magicule on things. I’ve got some weirdos who enjoy researching as well, is it okay to send them your way?”</p>
<p id="line_1784">As I was mesmerized by her elegance, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suddenly said so pleasantly.</p>
<p id="line_1785">I further inquired about the matter.</p>
<p id="line_1786">According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the civilizations dwelling on the surface had a relatively low level of technology, while their nation dwelling underground seemed to have some high tech.</p>
<p id="line_1787">“How surprising, I thought you guys would have a higher profile with those…”</p>
<p id="line_1788">“I want to stay away from trouble. We may be found by that annoying lizard if we were too eye-catching. Moreover, I didn’t want the angels to interfere with us. Before we can exterminate those things, all important research would be conducted underground,” she said proudly.</p>
<p id="line_1789">I didn’t expect that the strongest nation ruled by a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1790">Vampires were different from humans, and they possessed undead characteristics that allow them to live even longer the elves. The more highly evolved individuals didn’t even need to feed, instead, they could maintain their life force by taking small doses of human spiritual vitality… Vampires were no doubt at the top of the ecosystem. However, they also had weaknesses. The reason why vampires were called the rulers of the nights was not only due to their immense power wielded during nighttime. It also was due to the fact that they could be eliminated by sunlight.</p>
<p id="line_1791">This was the type of race that the vampires were, to have such a huge weakness while still maintaining high levels of lethality.</p>
<p id="line_1792">And among the highly evolved, individuals with great power, these vampires were subjects of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and were considered noble within their nation. Some of these seemed to have overcome their weakness against sunlight. These people were called the “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.” It seemed that they were able to operate wherever they went. Although they were few in number, vampires without weakness were still nightmares to humans. Even though these people were not as strong as Louis and Gunther, they were already at the gates of Calamity-class.</p>
<p id="line_1793">By the way, all these servants next to us were “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s.” Apparently, they only became <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s servants out of personal interest. But you could easily figure out that there was more to their intention than just ensuring <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s safety. “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s” were a bunch of idlers without any weaknesses. And given how idle they were, they developed interests in designing all kinds of things. Some of them even started designing some out of fashion a.k.a. hipster objects in an attempt to earn <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s favor.</p>
<p id="line_1794">“Seriously, they are really annoying. I ordered them to develop something more presentable, but they may be too tightly bound by established ideas. These people have no clue what progress is. I hope that you will at least educate them a bit when they come here.”</p>
<p id="line_1795">That was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s request.</p>
<p id="line_1796">“Um—well, we can do that…”</p>
<p id="line_1797">But I was worried as to whether they would cause any trouble or not.</p>
<p id="line_1798">These so-called “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Surmounter" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s” were the ruling elites. To have them do research in our nation, who knew what type of problem may emerge.</p>
<p id="line_1799">Noticing my hesitation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> further suggested:</p>

<p id="line_1801">“A Skill?”</p>
<p id="line_1802">“Yes. I shall grant you the “Ultimate Secret of faith and grace.””</p>
<p id="line_1803"><em>What is that, it sounds super strong!</em> As opposed to a technique for getting drunk, this actually sounded very powerful. She seemed to be for real.</p>
<p id="line_1804">“What would that be then?”</p>
<p id="line_1805">“To put it simply, it’s a Skill that allows your believers to carry part of your strength,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said so to me with an evil smile.</p>
<p id="line_1806">Oi oi oi, are you seriously announcing a Skill so powerful in front of everyone’s faces—</p>
<p id="line_1807">«Answer. Individual “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” has applied “Dimension Severance.”»</p>

With it pointed out, I finally realized that except me, no one else seemed able to hear <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s voice. As expected from one of the strongest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s, her execution of such a Skill was so natural.</p>
<p id="line_1809">“You’ll teach me that Skill, and we are supposed to take in researchers from your nation to return the favor. Is that so?”</p>
<p id="line_1810">“Yep. Even with only the musical exchange alone, I would already be satisfied. If I have to be honest, consider this my appreciation gift for you.”</p>
<p id="line_1811"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to be genuine.</p>
<p id="line_1812">“Fine, I’ll accept your proposal.”</p>
<p id="line_1813">“Heh heh, then we have a deal.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1814">And so, I accepted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s proposal, followed by her teaching me the “Ultimate Secret of faith and grace.”</p>
<p id="line_1815">This Skill, to put it simply, was the principle of “Holy Magic.” This secret technique allowed me to use my “name” as a medium to help people cast magic. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> therefore could cast “Holy Magic” in the name of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. In other words, they were using part of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power.</p>
<p id="line_1816">Now that she had taught me the principle of it, the people under me who would be able to use “Holy Magic” would, surely, increase. This was a reward greater than I had expected. I couldn’t help but feel shocked.</p>
<p id="line_1817">But then again, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not born yesterday either. She had planned things very carefully before negotiating with me.</p>
<p id="line_1818">“I’m grateful for this opportunity, but is it really okay?”</p>
<p id="line_1819">“No worries. You probably would figure out the truth of the Skill with your own strength in a couple years or so. One should always utilize information like that more when it still retains some value.”</p>
<p id="line_1820">«…»</p>
<p id="line_1821">…I see.</p>
<p id="line_1822">Based on the upset look of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei, I could probably learn the Skill myself within a few years’ time. Indeed, with research to discover the true nature of magicule as well as the information I learned about “Spirit-particles” during my battle with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, if I was to put this information together to dig to the root, the truth of the matter would have been revealed in no time. While I personally was unable to do it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei was still capable of it.</p>

<p id="line_1924">“At first, I even made a promise to pay them with gold coins, but halfway through I realized that something was odd. But it was already too late.”</p>
<p id="line_1925">When the coins in the treasury had been exhausted, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had started paying the merchants from his own pocket. Yet there was a limit to his ability to pay; that was why he had to explain the situation to the merchant that he had been acquainted with. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> then discovered a shocking fact. He didn’t know that these shop owners had actually been doing business with these new retailers and the retailers only took universal currencies.</p>
<p id="line_1926">If it were trade between nations, they could always use goods to afford the debts. Or when cash was not used in a transaction, merchants instead utilized certificate documents. Eventually the debt would be paid, but it would not be done for the time being. There was no concept of interest in this world, so under these circumstances, neither side would endure any losses. This was a common way of trading in this world.</p>
<p id="line_1927">However, our nation had no credibility at our disposal.</p>
<p id="line_1928">Right now, we had no choice but to agree to others’ demands of payment in cash. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was well aware of this too, which was why he’d managed the budget discreetly and selected trading partners carefully. According to his calculations, there should have been many large-scale transactions. In that way, there would be change when using the star gold coin. The gold coins returned could then be used to pay off everyone.</p>
<p id="line_1929">Even if that was not the case, he and the owners of the major shops had developed deep ties over the years. And it wasn’t a stretch for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to think that they would give him a pass one way or another. He thought that they might acknowledge a certificate of proof, or even accept payment through the gold coins of the ancient kingdom. Yet those retailers refused to accept, and even the merchants with a good relationship with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were troubled by it.</p>
<p id="line_1930">“I see. No matter how you look at it, it seems that someone has been pulling the strings behind this.”</p>
<p id="line_1931"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, standing behind me, concluded without hesitation upon hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_1932">“I thought so as well, I just didn’t expect them to draw us back in this way…”</p>
<p id="line_1933">So <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also believed that someone was trying to drag us down?</p>
<p id="line_1934"><em>But, who could it be…?</em></p>
<p id="line_1935">“I’m really sorry, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. This is all because I didn’t notice your concern earlier—“ Rigurd sighed.</p>
<p id="line_1936">He was too busy receiving guests before, yet he still wanted to hold himself responsible, believing that it was not just <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s problem. Indeed, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> shouldn’t be the only one to be held accountable.</p>
<p id="line_1937">“In other words, someone trying to cause us to lose credits?”</p>
<p id="line_1938">“That’s more or less the case. According to the international charter settled by the Western Nation Council, we must use gold coins produced by the Dwarven Kingdom to pay for the goods. Even though each kingdom has their own regulations, the retailers’ demands stand in accordance with just the Western Nations…”</p>
<p id="line_1939">If it were merchants from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they’d probably take our circumstances into consideration and reach an agreement with us due to the discounts we’d given them in terms of tariffs among other things. We’d already built a level of trust. But the people that were causing problems were formal merchants under the Council State Allies. They were all citizens of these nations and therefore could argue that they were acting according to international laws.</p>
<p id="line_1940">Even if we told them that it was the special regulation of our nation, surely, they would not yield so easily. That aside—</p>
<p id="line_1941">These people possibly just all conspired to create problems on purpose. If so, applying an uncompromising attitude could lead to adverse consequences. In that sense, we had reasonable suspicion that this was exactly the outcome that our adversary wanted.</p>
<p id="line_1942">“If we insist on them obeying the regulations of our nation, perhaps the council will also oppose us.”</p>
<p id="line_1943">“It would have been different if we were already part of the council, but since we intend to join in the future, this may cause the situation to be tense.”</p>
<p id="line_1944">Normally there wouldn’t be any issue, paying with the ancient kingdom’s gold coins. But if their intention were to destroy our nation’s integrity… Perhaps they wanted to see if our kingdom would be willing to obey international regulations or not.</p>
<p id="line_1945">“Could the council members be behind this?”</p>
<p id="line_1946">“The merchants came from all over the world. They must have done it by arranging retailers into the mass of merchants in secret. Although I don’t know who our enemy is, this is not as simple as we thought. By plotting this way, it shows that they were not afraid to take on some losses and have put their own cost and benefits out of the picture. I believe that they only have one goal, that is to destroy our nation’s reputation.”</p>
<p id="line_1947">Despite <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s appearance and the size of his past country of residence, he was a respected individual in the underworld.

<p id="line_1948">“Can’t we just force them to comply with our kingdom’s rules?”</p>
<p id="line_1949">I approved of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words.</p>

<p id="line_1957">How surprising, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words were not just any lucky guess, but she seemed to have genuinely understood to give the response.

<p id="line_1958">“Creatures such as human beings are truly incredible. They cannot survive without cooperation, yet they caste among themselves to determine each person’s status.

<p id="line_1960">“Indeed.”</p>
<p id="line_1961"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation was very straightforward. I also felt the same after hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s comment.

<p id="line_1962">“How laughable.

<p id="line_1963">And of course, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the one to agree. The two seemed to be on the same page on this.</p>
<p id="line_1964">“Hehe, I see that the second secretary shares the same view.”</p>
<p id="line_1965">There went all my praise for her. <em>Looks like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s nature was not altered that much after all.</em></p>
<p id="line_1966">“I’m not permitting any of this.”</p>
<p id="line_1967">The two seemed very regretful. <em>You guys sure were tacit at the wrong time.</em></p>
<p id="line_1968">“Anyhow, we cannot leave this unattended. Shall I run an investigation on the previous employers of these merchants in detail?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souei" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked for my order.</p>
<p id="line_1969">Perhaps we could get some dirt on them. This appeared necessary. But that would have to wait until after the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> finished. As of yet, we were unable to make a move without caution, just to deal with any emergency. After resolving the problem at hand, we would expose the enemies in time.</p>
<p id="line_1970">“That’s also important, but we should sit on it for now. By the way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, what’s the deadline of the payment? Have you come up with any good ideas?”</p>
<p id="line_1971">First, we needed to show everyone that we are willing to follow the regulations of the Council. If we were still unable to break the stalemate, we would have to see about it then. After all, I refused to let it come to war or affect people’s lives. I doubted the situation was that dire.</p>
<p id="line_1972">“Indeed. They seemed to also enjoy the celebration and said that they were willing to wait until the next day after the end of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. My friends also tried to help persuade them, but they said that it is as much time as they can spare—”</p>
<p id="line_1973">The next day after the end of the celebration—it was the first day today, so there were two more days at our disposal. We would have to pay up after three days.</p>
<p id="line_1974">“Right now, my friends are gathering money for us. Although we will take more or less some loss, they are taking the ancient kingdom’s gold coins in exchange for dwarven gold coins. But whether we can mobilize the cash in time is unknown…”</p>
<p id="line_1975">That was rough… But that was to be expected. Essentially, transportation alone would be difficult.</p>
<p id="line_1976">The lieutenants could use “Dimension Transportation” to reduce time, but to run around looking for gold coins that may not even be settled would be far too inefficient. While unlikely, it was possible that the enemies might try to distract and transfer my lieutenants out of town. It was best not to make a hasty move.</p>
<p id="line_1977"><em>I got it!</em> I recalled that the Beast Kingdom had given us some gold bars—so why not just create some counterfeit coins with that? Through the replication ability of my ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Analyze and Assess" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ I would be able to make counterfeit coins. It was impossible for dwarven technologies to see the difference, right?</p>
<p id="line_1978">«Answer. The viability of said solution is zero. Each dwarven gold coin is enchanted with Engravement Magic. They are rigorously regulated with serial numbers, and the merchants would be able to instantly detect real coins from counterfeits.»</p>
<p id="line_1979"><em>Ah, so that’s how it is</em>…</p>
<p id="line_1980">I took out a coin from my ‘Stomach’ to observe. There really were numbers engraved on them. It definitely wasn’t hard to create coins that looked like the real deal. But if there were two gold coins that looked exactly the same, it would be proof that one of them was fake.</p>
<p id="line_1981">Surely there was no need for them to use such precise technology. To me, it felt like in the past, no matter which country it was, counterfeiting currencies would always result in punishment with the equivalent to death. In this world, people had even combined magic and technology to apply absolute regulation. Since if they wanted to unify the currency used, they naturally would not want people to be able to make counterfeits easily.</p>
<p id="line_1982">“If we can’t counterfeit, there’s probably no way we can buy back…”</p>
<p id="line_1983">The crowd agreed.</p>
<p id="line_1984">“Then, even though we will be taking some losses, can’t we use the massive amount of gold bars we have already to start off with?”</p>
<p id="line_1985">Surely the merchants would accept these as payment?</p>
<p id="line_1986">“Any smart merchant will likely agree to the proposal, but I’m totally against it!”</p>
<p id="line_1987">While I thought it was a good idea, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> protested it fiercely. He then gave me the reason.</p>
<p id="line_1988">“It will become our weakness. In future trading with other nations, they will use this as an example. They will think that ‘Even if we intentionally make things difficult for this country, they are still willing to take losses just to keep a clean record.’ By that point, they will just continuously trade unfairly and will never treat us as equal trade partners. Although they will probably cover it up on paper…”</p>
<p id="line_1989"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave a wry smile and explained it in a way that we could understand. If the merchants were able to find any weakness in our nation, we would be devoured clean. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, being the same kind of merchant, would totally do that himself, and so his conclusion was very likely to happen.</p>
<p id="line_1990">At this point, I had no choice but to accept.</p>
<p id="line_1991">“There are still two days left. We will use this time to gather the coins. The people who joined the celebration are not the type to be conservative with spending, let’s all work hard to get their cash!”</p>
<p id="line_1992">“Thanks for the effort.”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_1993">In conclusion, we couldn’t find a solution.</p>
<p id="line_1994">But I had decided to go all out: If we couldn’t reach a compromise, we might as well just force them into obeying our nation’s regulation. We didn’t always have to obey others’ rules. <em>This is <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. We have our own rules.</em></p>
<p id="line_1995">But of course, while it was best to stay in their lane, we insisted on making equal and just demands for both sides. Regardless of the outcome, they wouldn’t be the only ones to suffer losses. Even if they were not happy with the ancient kingdom’s gold coins, nor accept proof certificates or complain about using goods to trade goods, they didn’t have enough to badmouth us.</p>
<p id="line_1996">“Anyway, let’s not worry about them too much. This is our kingdom, if we really are at a loss of way, we will just tell them to obey our kingdom’s rule. Let’s not worry too much and just do our best!”</p>
<p id="line_1997">“Understood.”</p>

<p id="line_1999">The Council may have an impression on us, but we would be able to know who the foes were at least. I had to look at things optimistically. Perhaps they weren’t even foes to begin with, just people trying to test us. It was too early to make that assumption.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2000">“That’ll be all, let the meeting end today! Good work everyone!”</p>
<p id="line_2001">After my exclamation, the routine report session of the night concluded. The issue had been put aside, though I expected that, “Things may turn out to be challenging…”</p>
<p id="line_2002">But worrying too much was not good for your health. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have put down a lot of work for it, so now I decided to share it with him.</p>

<p class="no-indent" id="line_2016">I had a hangover.</p>
<p id="line_2017">I couldn’t get drunk before, but by tuning down my ‘Poison Nullification,’ I was able to overcome the issue and finally get sloshed. It was the technique <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> taught me, and I had treasured it ever since.

<p id="line_2019">«…How unfortunate, the effect of ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Pain Nullification" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ has also been suppressed. You will feel the pain for a while»</p>
<p id="line_2020">Oi oi oi, aren’t you just targeting me on purpose…? It was angry last time as well, and it’s even more—</p>
<p id="line_2021">«Answer. That fact could not be found.»</p>
<p id="line_2022"><em>No no no, that is a fact.

<p id="line_2023">But my comeback was no use against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. I was very blatantly ignored, leaving me to battle the headache on my own.</p>
<p id="line_2024">“I need to reflect and pay attention next time,” is what I would tell myself every single time, but I’d probably end up doing the same thing when the opportunity popped up again.</p>
<p id="line_2025">«…»</p>

<p id="line_2029">The headache lasted a while before easing down a bit. I would really need to be careful in the future.</p>
<p id="line_2030">Seriously, eating is like doing drugs. You need food to keep going, but if you have too much, it would ruin your body. And by that analogy, it’s the same thing for drinking—wait…that didn’t really make that much sense.</p>
<p id="line_2031">Ultimately, I could just enjoy the sensation of being drunk. I didn’t really have to force myself to drink until I was completely wasted… I just happened to have too much fun with the boys. After visiting the night market with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the rest, I went to visit the VIP Only Elven Cabaret at level 95 of the labyrinth for an inspection.</p>
<p id="line_2032">It was the top cabaret of our nation, designed and intended for VIP guests exclusively. However, for the sake of promoting our nation, we also opened it up for the other guests.</p>
<p id="line_2033">And there it went. In the morning, people were still excited, unable to forget their concert experience. Some lost themselves in enthusiastic discussions regarding the capabilities of the healing potion.</p>
<p id="line_2034"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Vesta were there too. We, of course, couldn’t hide away from them and were forced to stay with them for quite a while. In the end, we had a great conversation and chatted until late over bottles of alcohol.</p>
<p id="line_2035">It felt great to be hearing compliments about my companions and having been overjoyed, I couldn’t help but want to get drunk. I was indeed reflecting at this point; I hope you guys can understand how I felt at the time. Besides, I wasn’t the only person who got wasted, so were the guests.</p>
<p id="line_2036">All in all, they spent a lot of money at the cabaret. All the better for us. More good news: I had been discussing the matter of insufficient coins with a drunk <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> when Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> joined in, to which they agreed to consider aiding us. I supposed that was the power of alcohol.</p>
<p id="line_2037">«……»</p>
<p id="line_2038">—Something like that.</p>
<p id="line_2039">Already worn down a bit, we braced for the morning of the second day of the festival.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2040">The recently finished <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Colosseum" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a huge building. It was large enough for 50,000 people and had a roof that stuck out over the audience seats, which was used for sun-screening. It had a semi-circular shape, much like a pterosaur’s wing membrane over the wing bone.</p>
<p id="line_2041">To be honest, this design was mainly due to my personal preference. I wanted to make the atmosphere a bit creepier and deliberately designed it this way. The intended purpose of it was to block out the sun, but no one really believed that.</p>
<p id="line_2042">People cried out, were scared, and raised their heads to see it. But there were nonetheless some weirdos who seemed very excited. The audience was crowding all over the place and all of the seats were occupied. The sheer turnout was all thanks to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s invitations. He was truly amazing. While there was much disappointment and stress last night, the man was still very reliable.</p>
<p id="line_2043">The audience seats surrounded an empty area, which we had prepared as the stage for battle. After processing a selection of giant rocks, we embedded them in this empty lot. We first compressed the hard rock into a cube, two meters in length. We then arranged them carefully as a base. The slits between the blocks were filled with a sticky buffer material, making them, as a whole, look like one giant, flat rock plate.</p>
<p id="line_2044">Since there wasn’t enough time, I also constructed a part of it. Normal, hard rocks were already three hundred times harder than cement, and with magicules infused into the rock base of the colosseum, it became ten thousand times that. It was two meters thick alone, and its hardness put nuclear blast shelters to shame.</p>
<p id="line_2045">I hadn’t done any real testing, but I was certain it should survive a direct nuclear magic strike without a crack. Not to mention that the physical layer was also reinforced by a magical enchantment.</p>
<p id="line_2046">Beyond that, we’d set up a double-layer defense barrier. The first layer covered the entire ground. It went all the way to the spectator seats in a large-scale magic circle. In order for it to withstand <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s future battle training, I made sure it was impenetrable from the get-go.</p>
<p id="line_2047">The second barrier stretched around the inner circumference of the seating, right in front of the first row of benches where the audience sat, extending in a diameter of around fifty meters. The battleground was above the two magic circles.</p>
<p id="line_2048">The double barrier was meant to protect the venue and prevent the audience from being impacted by the event. The first barrier would halt magicules from flowing through, but posed no restrictions on Skill usage. Therefore, if someone were to launch a powerful magic attack, it could still impact the surroundings. So just in case, we set up the second barrier. And, worst-case scenario, I could just launch ‘Absolute Defense’ of ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Covenant King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Uriel.’</p>
<p id="line_2049">While I didn’t want anyone to see me using the Skill, it was better than having my guests get hurt. I would activate it the instant there was an issue, so no one would find out. There definitely wasn’t gonna be a problem since we did it so discreetly.</p>
<p id="line_2050">Honestly, I was pretty sure the double-layer barrier alone would do the trick. It was one thing if my lieutenants were to join in the battle, but the abilities of the contestants alone were hardly enough to wreck the place. At least that’s what I thought, but I didn’t expect the “Chosen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to have joined in…</p>
<p id="line_2051">The venue was packed with excited onlookers. Go figure.</p>
<p id="line_2052">In this world, there weren’t a lot of entertainment events, so something like this would obviously cause a ruckus.</p>
<p id="line_2053">The martial tournament held in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom was already super popular. Every year, they would have adventurers of different ranks attending the tournament to fight for the championship.</p>
<p id="line_2054">However, our tournament differed slightly, as spectating it was open to average citizens as well. In <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, only the wealthy got to partake as the audience, while the commoner had to wait for the results to be unveiled. Some people would climb atop roofs or poles, trying to catch a glimpse from above the ground. But they probably couldn’t see much given the long distance.</p>
<p id="line_2055">By contrast, the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Colosseum" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in our nation had rings of benches installed in incremental heights along a slope, which allowed for a larger number of spectators. As a bonus, we had installed giant screens to live stream the battle for people in the audience to view from all four directions.</p>
<p id="line_2056">With the light magic engravings, it was extremely easy to enlarge a projection of the match. Some guests seemed to recognize the same device that was used during yesterday’s tech presentation. They did seem pretty interested in the device, so I predicted that it would have a pretty decent promotional effect.</p>
<p id="line_2057">In this way, we could slowly move towards success by attracting clients and building a strong foundation. This was the same technique I used when I was doing a nine-to-five job.</p>
<p id="line_2058">That was why the guests were able to see the stage clearly. They could also view the enlarged image on the screens. The audience would surely be satisfied.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2059">The participants began to enter the center of the stage. All eight men stood in a line facing the VIP booth. All screens were showing the contestants’ faces, and even their expressions were clearly visible. These individuals all looked very distinct. By the way, some of these eight seemed quite familiar. Obviously, I had seen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but…</p>
<p id="line_2060">Despite my being shocked by this, the introductions began without delay. As planned, we introduced the contestants one by one. I also instructed people to switch up the screen view and show the contestant’s face, respectively.</p>

<p id="line_2069">Even if he did take his opponents down in one swift slash, there was no way he could hide his moves in front of the entire audience.</p>

<p id="line_2109">If they were to create a special space with rules such as restraining magic use—hmm, that would make an interesting idea of applying it. In that way, it could be used as a ‘Defensive Barrier’ to lower the attack power of the enemies as well.</p>
<p id="line_2110">Since they would be working inside the labyrinth, they could also negotiate with the adventurers by adding conditions such as giving additional treasure, etc. Now that they had even mastered skills like this, the two were becoming more and more like dungeon bosses.

<p id="line_2141">It was a bad matchup.

<p id="line_2142">Moreover… All three of them happened to be grouped in the same division with such a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> alongside them.

<p id="line_2143">But anyway, since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was so pissed, to the point of wanting to retrain them, I looked forward to their future performance.</p>

<p id="line_2145">No, she knew well enough. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was making fun of him. In other words, she must have been in contact with Milim at some point.</p>
<p id="line_2146">Milim had been working hard to make some final adjustments to the labyrinth—or so she said. But it was better than her coming to meddle with things, so I took her by her word. I didn’t expect her to interfere in the match in this way.</p>
<p id="line_2147">For that matter, I didn’t invite Veldora either. At that moment, he was probably happily building the labyrinth with Milim and Ramiris, with all his mind focused on it. We would be in trouble if he came and destroyed the tournament out of excitement, this being just one of the reasons why I didn’t invite him.</p>
<p id="line_2148">While I didn’t expect Milim to send someone in her place, Veldora didn’t have any subordinates, so I wouldn’t have to worry about him sending someone to join. But the question now is, who was going to come out on top…</p>
<p id="line_2149">The difference in strength was a bit too overwhelming.

But ultimately, even if Lion-Mask won, it was fine. I was actually more afraid of them beating each other too badly. Moreover, I was curious about what would happen if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> encountered him.

It was understandable—they probably wouldn’t have the opportunity to witness another Rank A against Rank A battle for the rest of their entire life. Because the two’s power levels were about the same, a victor had yet to be decided.</p>

<p id="line_2327">“Ranga… What are you doing?”</p>
<p id="line_2328">“Tsk, I didn’t expect that. As expected from Ranga, he’s got his own game as well…”</p>

<p id="line_2331">I said that I wouldn’t allow him to participate and I thought that Ranga would accept such an arrangement as well.

<p id="line_2334">I mean, I guess it was because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Ranga were on good terms with each other.</p>

<p id="line_2339">“Is this really okay?”</p>
<p id="line_2340">“In my humble opinion, summon spells are within the rules, so I believe it’s fine.”</p>
<p id="line_2341">If even Rigur said so, I’d let it pass. Then again, Ranga entered the tournament.</p>
<p id="line_2342"><em>Uh—should that be a foul regardless…?</em></p>
<p id="line_2343">Prior to that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would’ve had no chance in surviving the fourth round of the tournament. But with Ranga fighting alongside him, it had become far more difficult to predict the outcome. But upon recalling my original intention of testing out <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ability, things could actually be heading in a direction that I originally wanted.</p>
<p id="line_2344">Alright! Let’s not think too much about it. I had decided to adopt a more open-minded spirit and let things flow.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_2345">Round four.</p>
<p id="line_2346"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> versus Lion-Mask, the fight I was personally looking forward to.</p>
<p id="line_2347">“Kukuku, looks like I finally get to have a fun all-out brawl!”</p>
<p id="line_2348">Lion-Mask looked ecstatic.</p>
<p id="line_2349">“I never expected to have the chance to duel such a great warrior, I am indeed lucky.

<p id="line_2350">“Ho, ya wanna fight me barehanded? Alright, I’m good at unarmed combat anyway.”</p>
<p id="line_2351">Agreeing to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s invitation, Lion-Mask prepared himself as well. A duel that would probably go down in history as one of the most exciting to date, unfolded.</p>
<p id="line_2352">There was a clash of fists.</p>
<p id="line_2353">That alone caused a huge shockwave that stirred up a whirl of wind on the stage. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not even using his legs, but instead relied on grappling and throwing punches to fight his opponent. He was maintaining balance by sliding his feet along the ground to take steps, unshaken by whatever blows he received.</p>
<p id="line_2354">That was the thing. I had seen it in boxing manga, the crouching stance where you raise both fists in front of your face to protect your head. Such a defensive style can be compared to an iron wall.</p>
<p id="line_2355">Moreover, you can strike when the opponent is least prepared. Not only is it a method to stall the enemy, but you also keep the potential to strike with explosive force. If you consider the lower half of the body to be the turret, the momentum of the entire body is accumulated at the fist before a strike is unleashed. The fists were not the only threat, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could also use his shoulder to bash the enemy, and combining certain attacks could lead to a suplex. He was like a heavy tank.</p>
<p id="line_2356">On the other hand, Lion-Mask was the all-rounder with attacks that varied in style. His physique was every bit as strong as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s, delivering equal amounts of brute force. But in this world, the amount of magicule one possessed was much more important than physical appearance. That was why Lion-Mask outmatched <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2357">But even still, he was unable to take down <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That went to show just how outstanding <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s defense was. A crescent kick, that could shatter a boulder into pieces, connected with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s arm. His opponent was apparently trying to knock him down, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to budge. It was almost as if he was saying “Go ahead, bring on a new attack.” Lion-Mask then launched a barrage of hand chops and punches from almost every angle, these were also accompanied by a flurry of roundhouse kicks and axe kicks, among other things. Strike after strike, he was so fast that it almost appeared like he had doubles.</p>
<p id="line_2358">Those consecutive attacks landed fast, yet none seemed to be hitting home while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was on guard.</p>
<p id="line_2359">“Huh! You’re pretty good! My attacks landed on ya like a gentle breeze!”</p>
<p id="line_2360">“Hehehe, I should be the one to complain. You leave me absolutely no chance to counterattack. All of your attacks seem to be thrown out in disarray, yet every one of them is so skillfully executed—“ <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> replied to him with a sense of regret in his tone. Right now, he was still able to hold up, but he would eventually get beaten down if this were to continue.</p>
<p id="line_2361">As expected from Lion-Mask, his strength was as authentic as it gets. Moreover, I had yet to see the depths of his power… It was as if he were relentlessly firing attacks from outside of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s range, aiming to penetrate his defense—like an attack helicopter. It was obvious which side had the advantage, but victory was not solely determined by strength, sometimes it came down to luck. So, who would Lady Luck favor this time—</p>
<p id="line_2362">This duel had boosted the atmosphere within the arena to maximum hype.</p>
<p id="line_2363">“S-so strong…!”</p>
<p id="line_2364">“Holy shit, this is insane, yo!” someone hollered while grasping a handful of fries. Others were screaming excitedly, their faces beet-red from all of the beer. The audience had also realized how strong the two truly were. Roaring cheers thundered throughout every corner of the colosseum.</p>

It seemed that the two had now become the most popular contestants of the tournament. Their duel raged on for several rounds more, yet a victor had yet to be determined.</p>
<p id="line_2366">As one attacked and the other defended—the match proceeded with both sides holding up on equal ground. The stalemate persisted for another thirty minutes. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also brimming with excitement, broadcasting the battle between the two vigorously.

<p id="line_2369">“Ahe, hehe, t-this is, is my honor. To be praised by a great man such as you—”</p>
<p id="line_2370">“Let’s skip the formality. By the way, I’ve got a question for ya.”</p>
<p id="line_2371">“—Ask away.”</p>
<p id="line_2372">“Why didn’t you use any Skills?”</p>
<p id="line_2373">“There was no need. Since your Highness won’t show your true form either.”</p>
<p id="line_2374">“Hehe, hahahahahahaha! Although you just called me a great man, are you seriously intending to win this match? How interesting. It’s true that I can’t reveal my true identity to the outside world, so I guess I’ll just have you witness what I’m good at instead!”</p>

<p id="line_2376">They conversed while keeping up their unwavering attacks and defense. The general audience couldn’t hear a thing, but I had heard their entire conversation as clear as day through <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s ears.</p>
<p id="line_2377">I had indeed been wondering why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wasn’t using Skills this entire time—so this was the reason.

<p id="line_2378">Lion-Mask—actually <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—could’ve shown off his true skill through ‘Beastilization.’ But because he was in disguise, he probably wouldn’t fight with all of his heart.</p>
<p id="line_2379"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was aware of this, that’s why he had refrained from using his Unique Skills ‘Guardian’ and ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gourmet" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>,’ instead, relying purely on his body. However, perhaps another reason for that, was that he didn’t want to reveal his abilities in front of the crowd. After all, a certain anonymous message also mentioned the same thing. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had seemingly agreed to keep his true ability concealed, so as not to reveal his real identity.

However, he must have also been confident in his ability to take on whatever was thrown at him, if he avoided a direct hit. He didn’t go for messy dodges, but instead maintained balance in his body and chose to use a crouch stance, in order to convert defensive action into attacks. To a ruler such as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, such a choice wouldn’t cause much harm regardless.</p>

<p id="line_2495">However, Ranga’s attack was not meant for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the first place, it was aimed at the mask on his face. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> chose to dodge in close quarters due to his unusually good instincts and prevented himself from getting harmed.

<p id="line_2522">“That dude with the mask was being way too dramatic about keeping his face hidden, big deal…”</p>
<p id="line_2523">Many such comments were tossed around openly.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2526">Afterwards—</p>
<p id="line_2527">“You participated in the fights without my permission, therefore I’m disallowing you to stay in my shadow as punishment for now!”</p>

<p id="line_2529"><em>I’m the one who should be asking why you thought that I would praise you.</em> However, looking into Ranga’s sad puppy eyes, my heart inevitably started melting.</p>

<p id="line_2649">As soon as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said that, the door swung open as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> entered the room.</p>
<p id="line_2650">“Have I kept you all waiting?”</p>
<p id="line_2651">“No, we only just arrived as well.”</p>
<p id="line_2652">Now that we’d had our greeting, everyone was seated.</p>
<p id="line_2653">“Let’s start with the conclusion. I contacted HQ this morning to have them gather the remaining gold coins. So far, we were able to gather one thousand five hundred coins. It’s not much, but we can’t have the people pay for it. Moreover, we have to prepare it by tomorrow morning, this is our limit.”</p>
<p id="line_2654">If we were talking about gold coins in circulation, it wouldn’t be so difficult to get enough. But if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was to withdraw gold coins without causing negative effects to the Dwarven Kingdom, this was as much as he could get. It went without saying that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was only willing to help because I requested him to exchange gold coins with our star gold coins.</p>
<p id="line_2655">“I’m really sorry, the amount seemed to be greater than I imagined. Thanks a lot.”</p>
<p id="line_2656">“Hmm, I’ll have someone carry it over by pegasus, it should arrive by next evening.”</p>
<p id="line_2657"><em>One thousand five hundred gold coins are quite heavy, I feel bad having them transport it here, I should use “Dimension Domination” to get the money. It’s probably safer and more ensured.</em></p>
<p id="line_2658">“It’s me who requested you guys, I’ll be the one to get it.”</p>
<p id="line_2659">“…I see, you seem to know ‘Dimension Transportation,’ that’s indeed more secure. I understand, I’ll inform them about this. That aside, let’s talk business, will this be enough to pay the merchants?”</p>
<p id="line_2660">“Hmm—about that…”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2661">Unfortunately, we were still short by a bit. This <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was the first of its kind, so the budget we planned was huge. Therefore, the amount of gold coins required was pretty incredible—with three thousand coins and more. This would be three hundred million yen in the economy of my past life. Considering the economic scale of this world, that’s an almost horrifyingly wasteful sum of money.</p>
<p id="line_2662">This was simply how rich our treasury was. We had 1,500 star gold coins, which could be exchanged to roughly 150,000 gold coins. That’s why we didn’t spare their usage, after all, it was just two to three thousand coins. It wasn’t that our nation had no money, we could manage to pay if exchange were possible. But since the people at the receiving end were all retailers and small businesses, this did not work. And so we had to find gold coins from our treasury…</p>
<p id="line_2663">Our nation just managed to get into currency economy, the flow of gold coins at this point was still limited. Even though we’d gathered all sorts of silver coins, there were less than a hundred gold coins of the Dwarven Kingdom.</p>
<p id="line_2664">This, plus my own money, made three hundred gold coins. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> managed to gather around one thousand coins. This added up to approximately one thousand four hundred coins. Even with the addition of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s part, we still didn’t have three thousand coins.</p>
<p id="line_2665">“Not enough, still?”</p>
<p id="line_2666">“I’ve calculated a bit; we are still a couple of hundred coins short.”</p>
<p id="line_2667">“Even if your budget shortage was calculated so casually, how on earth did you manage to hold this type of celebration…”</p>
<p id="line_2668">“I just came up with the idea. The duration is short anyway, so I can’t really help myself not to.”</p>
<p id="line_2669">“…I don’t even know where to start my grievances with you.”</p>
<p id="line_2670"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sighed greatly, looking at me dumbfounded. <em>But, that’s because… Everyone was for it.

<p class="space-break" id="line_2671">“If that’s the case, shall I pay the remaining portion?”</p>
<p id="line_2672">Halfway through our conversation, someone suddenly cut in. Curious who it was, I turned towards the direction. It turned out to be the emperor of Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—Elmesia.</p>

It was for a brief second, but enough for people to notice the change. I had my guard up too, but at the same time, questioned <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>:</p>
<p id="line_2674">“How strange, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san… Why has the emperor come as well?”</p>
<p id="line_2675">“Umm, about that—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I went to discuss it with the emperor, and she agreed to provide aid without hesitation—”</p>
<p id="line_2676">Elmesia had a big smile on her as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> explained. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, on the other hand, looked depressed. <em>I see what’s happening here, the emperor must have forced him to do it.

<p id="line_2677">“I see, actually, we should handle this problem our—”</p>
<p id="line_2678">“Hmm—aren’t you lamenting about not enough money? I only proposed to help with the hope of creating a foundation for the mutual friendship of our nations.”</p>
<p id="line_2679">Her face was filled with a smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. My instinct told me—<em>things are getting messy.</em></p>
<p id="line_2680">“No, I mean…”</p>
<p id="line_2681">I trusted my instinct and decided to reject her somehow. It was true that we wished to exchange some gold coins, but I was more afraid of owing Elmesia a favor.</p>
<p id="line_2682">We were only short by a few hundred coins, we would at most intimidate those merchants a little. We simply had to avoid them looking down on us, as long as our rival did not suffer losses, they wouldn’t go as far as to hate us to the bone. Based on this consideration, I had made the judgement, however—</p>
<p id="line_2683">“Give it a rest now. Once this woman has spoken, she will persist until the end. It’s far worse dealing with her, than a whole group of merchants.

<p id="line_2684"><em>How surprising, it seems that even the great <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hero" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> finds it difficult to deal with Emperor Elmesia.</em></p>

<p id="line_2686">Elmesia smiled as she couldn’t hide her joy.

<p id="line_2687">“Please don’t call me that. Doesn’t matter, what do you really want?”</p>
<p id="line_2688">“You are still so serious, not a free-spirited man like your grandpa was.”</p>
<p id="line_2689">“It’s because of the type of person my grandfather was, that my father worked so hard. Let’s put that aside and get to the point now.”</p>
<p id="line_2690"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s personality was pretty free-spirited in reality, but he often played the role of a rigorous ruler. This was largely due to him observing the hard work of his father as he grew. While the former king still ruled the nation, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was having the time of his life during the last free period of his life. Apparently, it was then that he met <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Elmesia. It was also around the time when he became an apprentice of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_2691">Elmesia would still bring up old tales about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She was like a close relative to him that kept on mentioning his past stories. No wonder <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> got a headache just seeing her alone.</p>
<p id="line_2692">“How impatient, were you always so impetuous before?”</p>
<p id="line_2693"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> hid it well enough that people couldn’t tell, but he was in fact extremely irritated. I couldn’t see it, but that was not the case for Elmesia. Picking up on people’s actual feelings was a piece of cake for the royal court. That’s why they were constantly wearing masks and deceiving each other cautiously… Looks like I needed to call <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> my mentor in that regard, yet Elmesia was still treating him like an infant. No wonder why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s face was filled with disgust.</p>
<p id="line_2694">Elmesia then exclaimed, “Let me have a drink as well,” as she took a glass of fruit wine from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. She nonchalantly sat down, seemingly in no hurry to leave.</p>
<p id="line_2695"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> exchanged looks as both released a sigh. The two looked quite tacit, but they were both no different than children in Elmesia’s eyes, perhaps that’s why they were similar.</p>
<p id="line_2696">But of course, also myself, who’s inexperienced had no chance of winning in a negotiation with Elmesia. That’s why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> told me to forget about it.</p>
<p id="line_2697">“Ara, this tastes good as well.”</p>
<p id="line_2698">“You are too kind.”</p>
<p id="line_2699">The fruit wine poured by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed to have fit her appetite, filling her face with an even brighter smile. That was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s personal collection that tasted different with every sip. If she were to dislike it, it would be difficult to prepare anything better. I was a little relieved as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> spoke up once more with emphasis.</p>
<p id="line_2700">“Alright, that’s enough. Time is precious, I’m afraid there’s none to waste on your little hobbies.”</p>
<p id="line_2701">After his hurrying again, Elmesia was finally willing to talk business.</p>
<p id="line_2702">“Alright. If you want my help, I have something in mind for you to do as well. If you are to organize this type of celebration again, please invite me. If you are willing to invite me to any future events, I’m happy to exchange the money for you.”</p>
<p id="line_2703"><em>You dare to organize such an interesting event behind my back? Unforgivable</em>—that was Elmesia’s actual message.</p>
<p id="line_2704"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to hold his head as he looked towards the sky. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked troubled as well.</p>
<p id="line_2705">“I am happy to do that,” I answered without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_2706">Elmesia smiled joyfully hearing my response. The contrast of her behavior seemed to be too drastic, perhaps I had misjudged her. But since she liked the lively time of celebration and talking about participating in said projects, it was right down my alley.</p>
<p id="line_2707">“Royalties are not slaves to the people. If royalties live carefreely, so will the people be joyful. I am happy too; everyone will be happy!”</p>
<p id="line_2708">“It makes sense, and it’s my thoughts exactly. I am glad that someone is on my side, I’ll be looking forward to encountering you in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_2709">I shook hands with Elmesia with a smile. Now Elmesia was my comrade. Aside from me and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, with the addition of Elmesia, the “Bad Idea Trio” was suddenly formed. Even though <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were shivering, seemingly sighting omens, we simply did not care.</p>
<p id="line_2710">And then Elmesia took out her magic wallet.</p>
<p id="line_2711">“I only have some pocket changes with me, at most one thousand gold coins. But if you want more, I can request more to be brought here.”</p>
<p id="line_2712">“No, that should do for now. Allow me to exchange it with ten star gold coins,” I answered rather casually as well, but what on earth was this person thinking?</p>
<p id="line_2713"><em>She’s been wandering about with a thousand gold coins. I can only say that her concept of money is a bit weird. Looks like she’s an authentic billionaire, it was the right choice to listen to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words and not make her an enemy.</em></p>
<p id="line_2714">“Alright, just remember to fulfill your promise.”</p>
<p id="line_2715">“Of course!”</p>
<p id="line_2716">I nodded with a smile at Elmesia’s response. She then immediately began to exchange money with me on the scene.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_2717">Now we just had to wait for the one thousand five hundred gold coins exchanged at the Dwarven Kingdom and we would have enough money. The problem had finally been resolved. I was relieved of a huge burden.</p>

Someone tried to outsmart me, to prevent me from gaining renown, now their plan had been exposed and defeated. We didn’t need to apologize to the vendors and had saved face. It was as though I’d relieved a boulder from my heart, my mood gradually became better. At that moment, Elmesia suddenly commented something worth pondering on.</p>
<p id="line_2721">“But I figured, even if you didn’t have time to prepare the gold coins, someone would be willing to assist you.”</p>
<p id="line_2722">“Hmm, what do you mean by that?”</p>
<p id="line_2723">I didn’t understand and asked straight away.</p>
<p id="line_2724">“In order to make a subject obedient, rather than using sticks to coerce or intimidate, it is better to just do them a favor. It is simpler and has a higher chance of success.”</p>
<p id="line_2725">Elmesia gave a smile as she finished her sentence. There was no doubt about it, that was the smile of a ruler. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was suddenly inspired by her words.</p>

<p id="line_2728">“Kufufufufu, what an interesting thought. They first caused the problem and they tried to do us favors by helping us. That’s certainly a plausible plan, but—”</p>
<p id="line_2729">“Even if they have no coins with them, they can just take out some proof certificate. To let the high-ranked officers of the nations see how untrustworthy you all are while also demonstrating their own credibility. In that way, they would be selling you a favor.”</p>
<p id="line_2730">“How greedy, that’s truly the thought pattern of humans. I’ve learnt a new lesson.”</p>
<p id="line_2731"><em>Eh, could that mean? In order to sell us a favor, will the person trying to get close to us appear and convince the retailers? And that this person is only a pawn that is following orders and can be discarded at any moment?</em></p>
<p id="line_2732"><em>I see—if we trust the person, they will be getting close to us, and if we raise our suspicion, will they abandon the plan?

<p id="line_2733">“I don’t really understand something that complicated, but do you know who is behind all this?

<p id="line_2735">“I’m not sure about it either. After all, our dynasty was never part of the council. But—if it’s that mister over there, surely, he has learnt something, hasn’t he?”</p>
<p id="line_2736">Elmesia turned her eyes to a certain direction, in her line of sight was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> who had been pondering by himself.</p>
<p id="line_2737">“Eh, were you talking about me?”</p>
<p id="line_2738">He seemed rather nervous upon being appointed. Soon enough though, he regained composure and spoke up in a rather troubled tone:</p>
<p id="line_2739">“I did hear some rumors. Apparently in private, there is a sub-committee that runs the entire western nations.

<p id="line_2740">According to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there seemed to be some rumor among the merchants.

<p id="line_2758">“Well, about that, I will stop him before he loses control. That’s all I can do to prevent casualties, isn’t it?”</p>
<p id="line_2759"><em>If there’s any other way, please enlighten me.</em> I could only try to intervene before he lost control. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed rather happy that I said so.</p>

But I really didn’t seem to agree with many ideas in this world, I hoped I’d be able to discuss these with them.

<p id="line_2787">I was going to dismiss the conference just before Elmesia wanted to continue. She looked at me very seriously, seemingly in a hurry. Unsure as to what she wanted, I asked nervously as well.</p>

Right now, he was contributing his culinary abilities for us, and I had not asked him what he planned to do after the festival, either. I personally hoped that he would remain in our nation, but that ultimately depended on Yoshida-san. If it was just introducing him to Elmesia, that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p id="line_2792">“Easy peasy. But, please don’t force Yoshida-san to do anything,” I answered Elmesia without hesitation.</p>

<p id="line_3020">Just as I was convinced of the fact that some unexplainable phenomenons just happen in this world, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Wisdom King" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei proceeded to set me straight.

People under its influence would be manipulated both in terms of thought process and emotion.</p>
<p id="line_3022">The reason as to why <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had given up the championship must have been because he had witnessed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power. This was just my guess, but since he was able to trick and convince <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to give up, based on that alone, it was likely that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t think he was able to win against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

In conclusion, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s own combat ability must not have been that great to begin with, or at least something along those lines.

<p id="line_3024">With that being said, he still should not be underestimated. After all, he had a huge amount of influence, and antagonizing him would just bring trouble. These kinds of people simply couldn’t be overlooked, and thus I felt the need to establish a good relationship with him.</p>

<p id="line_3123">And so he revealed the big scoop to me. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> proceeded to share his story, and I listened intently, quietly drinking tea.</p>
<p id="line_3124"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, in the original world, was a top student in a famous school known for its high graduation rate. He also had some lesser known hobbies, such as reading manga and light novels. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> thought that all of this (isekai) happened because he was too much of an otaku.</p>
<p id="line_3125">“My power seems to be some Unique Skill called ‘Chosen One’? Seriously, what kind of joke is that…”</p>
<p id="line_3126">It seemed that he desired being a hero too strongly and ended up in this world.</p>
<p id="line_3127"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s Unique Skill ‘Chosen One’ had a pretty obvious effect. It had the ability to induce suggestive ideas on the surrounding crowd, akin to brainwashing. The ultimate goal of the Skill was to make <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the hero character. It also ignored <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s own wishes, so even if he begged it to stop, the effect still remained.</p>
<p id="line_3128"><em>Should I call it useful or useless…</em></p>
<p id="line_3129">“But your power is truly strong.

<p id="line_3130">The effect it had during the tournament was the real deal. The winner was supposed to be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3131">“That’s right, but that is also what’s been bugging me. I didn’t do anything to begin with, yet everyone started to misunderstand… That’s how I won in <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> too,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> explained himself—that was why he got in over his head.</p>
<p id="line_3132">During the defeat of the crime syndicate, ‘Slave Trade Union,’ he was also only there to receive the credit and didn’t do anything himself. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had no choice in the matter, even if he tried.

<p id="line_3133">In my opinion, it was the right choice, mainly because the effect of ‘Chosen One’ would probably be—</p>
<p id="line_3134">«Answer. When confronted with an Ultimate Skill, most lower Skills will be rendered ineffective.»</p>
<p id="line_3135"><em>Indeed. It would be rendered useless against me.</em></p>

I could tell just by common sense that I didn’t stand a chance.”</p>
<p id="line_3139">I didn’t believe that was fully accurate. After all, many people with undisputed strength sought to challenge <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the past. But with that being said, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> did make the right choice this time.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3140">We continued to chat about various topics, learning about each other’s circumstances. Even though I only mentioned a bit about my own life, I learnt a lot about <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s story from then on.</p>

If he wanted to complain about anything, he would have to find <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. But the latter was a busy person after all, and the two couldn’t find time to make an appointment. So the pressure and displeasure grew with time.</p>
<p id="line_3142">Even though I didn’t ask, he still retold his story from start to finish in detail.</p>
<p id="line_3143">“Right, I wanted to talk with you a bit more, but the lunch break is about to end. Allow me to ask, what do you plan to do next?”</p>
<p id="line_3144">“Plan for what?”</p>
<p id="line_3145">“Nothing much, but didn’t you promise <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to battle him again? How about you go and challenge the dungeon?”</p>
<p id="line_3146">“AH!”</p>
<p id="line_3147">By the looks of it, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had forgotten all about that promise. He was planning to just pretend the whole ordeal had not transpired…</p>
<p id="line_3148">“W-what should I do?”</p>
<p id="line_3149">“Relax. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is in charge of guarding underground level 50. The dungeon is massive, just walking there would take a couple of days alone.”</p>
<p id="line_3150">“I-I see your point, so I should just pretend to challenge the labyrinth and just get a pass for today, right?”</p>
<p id="line_3151">“That’s right. Since the invited guests are expected to return to their home country tomorrow.”</p>
<p id="line_3152">The celebration was estimated to last three days. We predicted that the streets would be filled with people tomorrow, and that, by that time, our main job would be to direct the traffic. We’d be wrapping things up the day after tomorrow. We would start cleaning up by the time we guessed all the guests would have left.</p>
<p id="line_3153">We were only planning to show the public section of the dungeon for the sake of our guests, a.k.a. a preview opening. It wasn’t available for the public until it was officially opened. That meant that it would only be open for a mere few hours until nightfall. That should only be enough to take care of the upper levels.</p>
<p id="line_3154">In addition, I did have some ideas for the duel between <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. While it may suck for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, it would be troublesome if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were defeated. This was a rare opportunity after all; I wanted to exploit <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as a tourist attraction. In leading the expedition team to the labyrinth, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would be able to rile up challengers, provoking their fighting spirits.</p>
<p id="line_3155">“At least, that’s how I think. I would like you to help us advertise. What do you think?”</p>
<p id="line_3156">“I see, that does sound very reassuring. Is that why you gave Jinrai that god-tier armor? As long as I won’t die if I fail, that sounds interesting!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> agreed without hesitation to help me out.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3157">In all honesty, I didn’t actually have this in mind when I gifted Jinrai the armor, but it was more convenient like this anyway, since going into the labyrinth without chest armor would no doubt be suicidal.</p>
<p id="line_3158">“I’ll sneak some walkthrough guides to you, so you can get through quickly and easily. Moreover, if you find anything that needs changing or anything like that, please tell me.”</p>
<p id="line_3159">I had gone through the fifty lower levels’ design meticulously, which was why I was not going to give any information about the lower levels. I reminded <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of this and that he should be mindful of it. That being said, if they had their items in hand, they wouldn’t die. So there shouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p id="line_3160">“I get it! I’m like a beta tester.”</p>
<p id="line_3161">“Uh… Now that you’ve mentioned it, yes you are. Anyhow, you don’t have to force yourself too much, let’s go for five levels today.”</p>
<p id="line_3162"><em>Video games. That’s an interesting point of view.</em></p>
<p id="line_3163">“Okay. It was so nice to finally talk to you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama.

<p class="space-break" id="line_3164">He seemed to be quite reliant on his Skill, but still held his doubts. My promising aid would help alleviate those worries.</p>
<p id="line_3165">After all, our kingdom was at the forefront in terms of culture. We had established high-quality bathhouses and toilets, and the comfort level of our hotels was also far superior to other nations. Even <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> seemed shocked by the variety and deliciousness of the food.</p>
<p id="line_3166">“We have a music band and painting classes for whoever’s interested. I’ve also planned to introduce drama shows later on. I look forward to these myself as well, so I’m not limiting the budget on it.”</p>

<p id="line_3168">“Kukuku, of course, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3169">“UWOWOWO!

<p class="space-break" id="line_3170">In the end, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> decided to stay longer. I planned to stay in contact with him in private and share information. I noted that I should go chat with him more in the future. I wanted to hear more stories about the other world that I missed.</p>
<p id="line_3171">I also promised him to dig memories of manga from his head as well. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also very interested in my collection; I was certain we could be good friends in the future.</p>
<p id="line_3172">And with that, I got a new companion.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3173">We were finally demonstrating the dungeon to the public.</p>
<p id="line_3174">As a precaution, I went to confirm some things before it went public. After reaching the lobby at the bottom of the labyrinth, Ramiris, currently full of energy, flew and rested on my shoulder.</p>
<p id="line_3175">“We are going live in a moment, how’re the preparations?”</p>
<p id="line_3176">“Hmph! Who do you take me for?” Ramiris scoffed.</p>
<p id="line_3177">From the next room, a smug-looking Veldora entered as well.</p>
<p id="line_3178">“GA-HAHAHA! Don’t worry, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3179"><em>Oh shit, that made me nervous.</em></p>
<p id="line_3180">“Oi oi oi, are you guys really alright? We can’t make any mistakes during today’s public tour!”</p>
<p id="line_3181">“Hehehe, chill out! You can count on me! We are switching on all sorts of safety measures.”</p>
<p id="line_3182">“Kukuku, but! Today is the day that the demonic labyrinth awakes!”</p>
<p id="line_3183">Ramiris and Veldora grinned evilly at each other.</p>
<p id="line_3184">Were there really no issues? For some reason I felt uneasy…</p>
<p id="line_3185">“I’ll say this one more time, very seriously. The labyrinth will be shut down again soon.”</p>
<p id="line_3186">“W-what?!”</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/illustrations/image11.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_3187"></p>
<p id="line_3188"><em>Seriously, what kind of reaction was that?</em></p>
<p id="line_3189">I’d explained this several times, but Veldora still hadn’t caught up.</p>
<p id="line_3190">I planned to oversee the situation and adjust the difficulty accordingly. That was why the labyrinth would be shut down for two to three days before reopening again.</p>
<p id="line_3191">We also hadn’t settled on certain issues for the labyrinth. This included pricing of entry tickets, as well as items such as the ‘Labyrinth Card’ to permit entry into the labyrinth. We also had yet to employ trained staff to run the facility.</p>
<p id="line_3192">Given how busy we were lately, we had no time to train such workers. I only planned to discuss such problems with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the aftermath of the festival.</p>
<p id="line_3193">Now that I really thought about it, handing control of the labyrinth to those two wasn’t such a good idea. I was originally going to do it myself, but Ramiris and Veldora were having fun running it and I was too busy. They weren’t listening carefully during the meeting either.</p>
<p id="line_3194">I could feel and relate to their anxiety towards the festival, which is why I wasn’t mad at them.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3195">“It’s alright, just stay calm, you guys. I’ll do what I can to get it running officially soon. You can enjoy yourselves when that happens.”</p>
<p id="line_3196">“Okay!”</p>
<p id="line_3197">“I have faith in you, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_3198"><em>This should do it.</em></p>
<p id="line_3199">It looked like we could make it through today just fine.</p>
<p id="line_3200"><em>Oh yeah, I almost forgot.</em></p>
<p id="line_3201">“By the way, did Milim drop by?”</p>
<p id="line_3202">“She did.”</p>
<p id="line_3203">“Hmm, she came back and forcefully took two unlimited ‘Revival Bracelets.”’</p>
<p id="line_3204">“Is that so? I heard that she was preparing levels 96 to 99. Those were the magic dragon cabins with geographic effects.”</p>
<p id="line_3205">“Yeah, she really put a lot of thought into it.”</p>
<p id="line_3206">“Um um, there were also those dragons Milim caught—she gave me all their commanding rights! She told me that if I take care of them well enough, they will eventually evolve into dragon lords, which means they will have enough intelligence to understand my orders!”</p>
<p id="line_3207">Ramiris seemed to be quite happy, to the point of claiming: “Turns out Milim does have some merit after all—”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3208">Some time ago, Milim came back with dragons and scared the living daylights out of everyone. The first two times, people complained, but from the third time onward, they got used to it. The residents no longer panicked over it, but instead accepted it as part of their daily routine.</p>
<p id="line_3209">Milim caught four dragons in total—a fire dragon, ice dragon, wind dragon and earth dragon. They were supposedly elemental archdragons, but they had the intelligence of livestock. Apparently, they could be raised like pets and even communicate with people.</p>
<p id="line_3210">“Oh—do those four also wear neck braces?”</p>
<p id="line_3211">“For now, they are my adorable servants; I’ll solidify the master-servant relationship with them in the future too!”</p>
<p id="line_3212">I see, Ramiris had already planned it all out.</p>
<p id="line_3213">Then it was settled. Back to the main issue.</p>
<p id="line_3214">“Milim is staying at the Dragon’s Den<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="ドラゴン部屋, this essentially means “Dragon Cabin” but editor suggested it “sounded lame.”" onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, right?”</p>
<p id="line_3215">“Um, she’s afraid that my servants won’t get enough exercise, so she got them some playmates!”</p>
<p id="line_3216">“She brought that lad we went fishing with, I think. Not sure why he’s playing with dragons though.”</p>
<p id="line_3217"><em>You’re better off not knowing.</em></p>
<p id="line_3218">I only wanted to learn Milim’s location. As long as she stayed at the bottom of the labyrinth, she’d pose no threat to the demonstration.</p>
<p id="line_3219">“Got it. Then she won’t come meddling with things, so that’s alright. We are opening the labyrinth soon, you coming to the VIP room?”</p>
<p id="line_3220">“Um! I want to go.”</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3226">With the lunch break over, a huge crowd returned to the audience seats.</p>
<p id="line_3227">Ramiris and I hurried to the VIP booth as well.</p>
<p id="line_3228">“Welcome back, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> welcomed me with a smile.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3229">His duties as a referee had concluded, and it seemed that he had been searching for me for a while. I nodded lightly in response, already ready to confirm whether all matters were in place.</p>
<p id="line_3230">Soon we would be opening the dungeon to the public, and there were many last-minute plans to work out after this. This was one of our biggest projects, that would eventually become one of the pillars of our nation. We hoped it would be able to attract even more guests in the future.</p>
<p id="line_3231">Luckily, no one had gone back to their home country after the noon break. The VIP booth had also almost filled up, so we had sufficient publicity.</p>
<p id="line_3232">Looking at the guest hotel, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were standing there. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were taking shifts as receptionist and broadcaster.</p>
<p id="line_3233">It was time. I signaled the two discreetly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3234">At the center of the stage, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stood with a microphone. He looked a bit more rigid as opposed to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, but still put up quite the show. The content of his broadcast was—</p>
<p id="line_3235">“Alright, the time is now! There is one last activity that we wish to introduce to you all during our three-day <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.”</p>
<p id="line_3236">“Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to have kept you waiting. The facility that we are about to demonstrate is the pride of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="The Tempest Federation" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the extremely challenging dungeon. It will be the most difficult undertaking opened by his Majesty, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to fellow adventurers. Will anyone be able to successfully break through this labyrinth—?”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3237">While it was okay to hold a demonstration meeting, the dungeon by itself was too dangerous for a bunch of humans to enter.</p>
<p id="line_3238">There were several hundred noblemen alone. In addition to the residents from the neighboring town, there were more than one thousand people in total. With all these people coming in, we didn’t have enough personnel to guide them properly.</p>
<p id="line_3239">Therefore, I came up with the idea to use a giant screen to broadcast the walkthrough progress of multiple teams.</p>
<p id="line_3240">However, there were problems on the technical level—</p>
<p id="line_3241">The live feed of the martial tournament was viewed clearly by the audience with the help of the giant viewing screen. The screen was set up with a projector that played the footage on the screen. It was a device developed by Vesta and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gabil" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and could be used on many different occasions. The recent battles had also been projected on the screen. It used a crystal ball within the projector that had photographic properties. The crystal ball also had engravings for magic communication. This way, when it took videos from far away, it could project it live at the scene.</p>
<p id="line_3242">In this way, the spectators were able to watch the challengers’ every move from a safe distance as entertainment. Things would devolve quickly if any prominent figures here were to get hurt. In light of this, we made sure that only representatives capable of safely exploring the labyrinth were able to experience it.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3243">“Now then, we shall be recruiting challengers here! Which warriors wish to challenge our nation’s pride, the Dungeon?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> announced, ecstatic. As she called for challengers, we began to move as well.</p>
<p id="line_3244">Ramiris followed suit, flying off my shoulder and summoning the illusion gate leading to the labyrinth at the center of the stage. All you actually needed to do was just walk down the stairs, but our demonstration was all about dramatizing things.</p>
<p id="line_3245">“ “ “OHOOOOH!” ” ”</p>
<p id="line_3246">See, just as we predicted, the audience was enthused as well.</p>
<p id="line_3247">At the same time, while many spectators were very excited, the adventurer visitors were all observing each other’s next move.</p>
<p id="line_3248">This time we were only open to volunteers, but still we hoped to use the opportunity to accumulate intrigue. Even if no one wanted to volunteer, we still had <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s squad to back us up.

<p id="line_3249">In order to prevent any accidents, I gave him the map of floors one to five. Hopefully, he was a competent propagandist.</p>
<p id="line_3250">The question was if there would be any other challengers—</p>

And that over-exaggerated martial tournament as well, all those matches must have been pre-planned. You think you can trick us into bowing down to ya—I won’t stand for that!”</p>
<p id="line_3252">“That’s right! Basson-aniki has a point!”</p>
<p id="line_3253">“If the street wasn’t as crowded then, Basson-aniki would have definitely won the tournament!”</p>
<p id="line_3254">“Hehehe, did you forget about me?”</p>
<p id="line_3255">“Don’t say that, Gomez. These people know you’re strong as well. With us working together, our team ‘Heavy Thunder’ is invincible!”</p>
<p id="line_3256"><em>Huh? I was wondering who came forth. They were challengers?</em></p>
<p id="line_3257">It seemed that this man called Basson missed the tournament because he arrived late. But in reality, he could probably tell the contestants’ abilities just by watching the matches… Although the quality of each match greatly differed, given that some contestants forfeited.</p>
<p id="line_3258">There were probably more people like Basson who thought they were the strongest. But honestly, that was fine. There were always people who just couldn’t accept reality. These people would be our future customers (as fat sheep to be slaughtered).</p>

<p id="line_3267">I stopped them immediately, though it was already worth celebrating that they didn’t mention anything about killing these people.</p>

<p id="line_3271">The black-cloaked mage Gomez.</p>
<p id="line_3272">Plus another four goons.</p>
<p id="line_3273">I decided to let these six be the first batch of challengers.</p>
<p id="line_3274">What followed was a group of unexpected characters.</p>
<p id="line_3275">A trio jumped out and shouted, “We want to challenge it as well!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3276"><em>Where have I seen them before—?

They were authorized to take on missions, regardless of borders. They hadn’t come along with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, so I thought they must have gone back to their hometown…</p>
<p id="line_3279">I didn’t expect them to have planned such things.

<p id="line_3281">“Of course we are. We haven’t done much adventuring lately—this is our chance!”</p>
<p id="line_3282">“Speaking of it, do I, <em>the captain</em>, get to decide anything? Anything at all?”</p>
<p id="line_3283">“Of course not, it’s already settled!”</p>
<p id="line_3284"><em>How reckless. Poor Cabal.</em></p>
<p id="line_3285">I could just about hear Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> screaming from the next room, followed by a <em>thump</em> sound before everything fell silent again. It wasn’t hard to imagine what happened there, but I won’t. I hoped <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and her friends could exit the scene before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> threw another tantrum.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3286">The third to enter was our <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-kun. He walked onto the stage casually and smiled towards the audience.</p>
<p id="line_3287">“MA-SA-YU-KI, MA-SA-YU-KIIII!” There was a wave of cheers.</p>
<p id="line_3288"><em>Enough already, we get it. He’s popular.</em></p>
<p id="line_3289">Counting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, his squad had four people in total. Jinrai had switched out of his shoddy armor into the set I gifted him. It was a magical silver armor that covered his whole body, crafted by Garm. It was high-end rare armor.</p>
<p id="line_3290">While it was heavier than the skeleton full-body armor <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wore, it had lower quality and durability. However, it was fancy enough to have a poison gas purification effect.</p>
<p id="line_3291">I also gifted <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> a rapier. When I asked him why he never drew his sword, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> casually explained, “Because…it was too heavy…” Even I got scared for him, hearing that. <em>Was he seriously all talk no walk?</em></p>
<p id="line_3292">Apparently, he had practiced Kendo before, but a real sword was always much heavier. Especially in this world, sword-fighting trends were unlike the slashes of a katana. Instead, the mainstream use of swords was to execute heavy chops. Thus there needed to be some weight to the swords. It was already very tiring for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to hold a sword in a fixed position for a long time.</p>
<p id="line_3293">I told him to at least practice a little bit, so I handed him a relatively light rapier. It was a failed recreation when I was preparing a gift for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Its weight and tenacity were almost as good as the original rapier, however, it was unsuccessful in recreating the special ability of “killing the opponent in the seventh attack.”</p>
<p id="line_3294">It was already difficult for him to lift this sword, so even if it didn’t have any high-end skills, it would be fine. The sword did, however, have the ability to reduce fatigue. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> only needed to swing it around for show. That rapier was more than sufficient.</p>
<p id="line_3295">Speaking of which, no one else noticed that they’d changed their gear, and instead all four were just showered in applause.</p>
<p id="line_3296">The time limit was three hours. From my calculations, they could, at most make it to the fifth level.</p>
<p id="line_3297"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party also had maps, so they had an edge over the other teams. They had all the support needed to help advertise.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3298">Finally, we had three teams.</p>

<p id="line_3312"><em>These two… Seriously, why were they acting like this?</em></p>
<p id="line_3313">They seriously didn’t hold back against people who spoke negatively about me. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s tricks had been piling on at this point; I really needed to start figuring out some countermeasures.</p>
<p id="line_3314">Anyhow, that aside, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had actually chosen to go solo apparently.

<p id="line_3315">There was no use for me to worry anyway.</p>
<p id="line_3316">From another point of view, I could also make him an example for people wanting to go into the labyrinth alone.</p>
<p id="line_3317">And so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was our fourth challenger.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3318">With the challengers gathered on schedule, it was time to get started.</p>
<p id="line_3319">The highly anticipated dungeon had finally opened.</p>
<p id="line_3320">We didn’t have a lot of time, so we would stream the labyrinth walkthrough with multiple parties advancing at the same time. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would stay back and broadcast the livestream with feeds of different teams.</p>
<p id="line_3321">The Dryads were perfect for the role of receptionist inside the labyrinth. They would also serve as the magic communicators (camera crew), moving with each team.</p>
<p id="line_3322">Apart from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s sisters <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Trya" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Triss" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there were also other dryads, albeit few in number. They were still young and inexperienced in battle. However, they still possessed highly abundant mana. Now, with Ramiris in charge, they were the best candidates to manage the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_3323">“Then—these four will be the managers of the labyrinth. Normally you won’t be assigned with any challengers, however, you will need to relay information about everyone’s walkthrough progress, so every team will be assigned with one as follower.”</p>
<p id="line_3324"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> read out their names as they began to greet everyone.</p>
<p id="line_3325">They were Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. It was inconvenient for them not to have names, so I named them randomly. That being said, it didn’t consume any of my magicules. Since Dryads were higher <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they only consumed their own magicules. These people were Ramiris’s subordinates after all, I only needed to help name them.</p>
<p id="line_3326">By the way, these sisters looked quite similar to each other, it was hard to differentiate them by eyesight alone.</p>
<p id="line_3327"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, surprisingly enough, used the wavelength of their mana to differentiate individuals, which was difficult for humans. Partly due to this reason, I had to name them in order to make it easier to recognize them.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3328">“If you run into any difficulty, just ask them for help! Now we are going to talk about rules! First of all, here is something for everyone!”</p>
<p id="line_3329"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> held up a few items to demonstrate to everyone as Alpha distributed the same things to each person.</p>
<p id="line_3330">“These are the items that will be sold when people enter the labyrinth. Has everyone got their items?”</p>
<p id="line_3331">Followed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words, each item was shown and enlarged on the screen. In times like this, having a projector was also particularly convenient.</p>
<p id="line_3332">The items shown were ten high-grade healing potions, one full healing potion, a ‘Revival Bracelet’ and a ‘Return Whistle.’</p>
<p id="line_3333">Since we wanted everyone to have a taste, we of course had to give them out for free. We were asking them to help us test out the labyrinth, so they could even take these items back with them as rewards.</p>
<p id="line_3334">Just in case, we also equipped the Dryads with the same items. If there was a problem, they could get back ASAP.</p>
<p id="line_3335">Given the sheer size of the labyrinth floors, it was unlikely for them to make it out of the first level. Even if they got to the stairs without getting lost, it was still over two kilometers’ walk in terms of distance. Since we made the floor into a maze, it would take even more time to complete.</p>
<p id="line_3336">For the next three hours, it’d be best if they tried their hardest and entertained the audience. When the estimated time was reached, we would pull them back out using the items.</p>
<p id="line_3337">There were, of course, other forms of rewards.</p>
<p id="line_3338">For promotional purposes, we also prepared treasure chests with decent equipment as gifts for everyone. When the labyrinth officially opened, these chests would only be found on the second floor and below, but this time they were up for everyone to grab.</p>
<p id="line_3339">We wouldn’t be mentioning these inside-dealings of course; <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> only explained what was necessary. Near the end, she began to explain the most important things.</p>
<p id="line_3340">“Well then, please have a look at this particular item. This is called a ‘Revival Bracelet.’ For anyone entering our nation’s labyrinth, you must purchase this item. After all, this has an important ability—it can resurrect the dead!” s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> explained, there was a wave of gasps from the crowd. <em>How is that possible</em>—and comments along those lines were uttered.</p>
<p id="line_3341">“Please rest assured! This is very important information, so please pay attention! This item only works inside the labyrinth of our nation! It’s useless outside, so please remember that or you will end up pretty dead if misused. I do hope everyone can understand that it is ineffective outside!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3342">That was the most important point.</p>
<p id="line_3343">If someone accidentally tried to use it outside… That was not something that you could just get away with an, “Oops, that didn’t work.” Moreover, it’d be problematic if they pushed the responsibility onto us, even though it was totally the fault of the user himself.</p>
<p id="line_3344">With that being said… There were also certain kinds of people in this world called <s>Karens</s> difficult customers.</p>
<p id="line_3345">In order to get it through their thick skulls, we had to clarify this point. We had to be thorough when going through things, in case anyone mistook its use and thought that it could work outside of the labyrinth. We had to ensure that even an idiot knew that it wouldn’t work outside to revive people. By that point, even if an accident did happen, it wouldn’t be our problem.</p>
<p id="line_3346">I didn’t want any of that unnecessary responsibility.</p>
<p id="line_3347">In my previous life, I found that people would always make the seller accountable for any issues, even if it was their own fault. In this way, to me, idiots who intentionally broke the rules and ended up dying was totally their own doing.</p>
<p id="line_3348">But either way, making sure everyone was well-informed was still our responsibility. We had to be extra cautious in that regard.</p>
<p id="line_3349">“—And that’s all! I once again urge everyone to not use it outside at all!”</p>
<p id="line_3350"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation was very clear for everyone to understand.</p>
<p id="line_3351"><em>There we go. Done.</em></p>
<p id="line_3352">The only problem left was for someone to actually experience using it. Normally, people would hesitate when confronted with such a thing. However, with Ramiris’s modification of the ‘Revival Bracelet,’ any pain and agony could be filtered out when a person was confirmed dead.</p>
<p id="line_3353">In addition, there was approximately a ten second gap between dying and being teleported back to the surface. We intentionally made it this way so people could use appropriate means to revive themselves.</p>
<p id="line_3354">With that being said, there were very few higher magic users that could perform the miracle spell ‘Resurrection.’</p>
<p id="line_3355">By the way, even though a full healing potion was unable to revive the soul of a person, within the labyrinth, the soul would remain in the body. In other words, it was actually possible to resurrect people by repairing their body using the full healing potion.</p>
<p id="line_3356">However, I feared that this again might create some misunderstandings in the outside world—which was why we designed it so that if no proper means of resurrection was applied within ten seconds, the body would be teleported to the surface.</p>
<p id="line_3357">Just as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, challenging the labyrinth was like playing a game.</p>
<p id="line_3358">With that, the explanation part was concluded.</p>
<p id="line_3359">Now we would have someone test out the ‘Revival Bracelet’ right here.</p>
<p id="line_3360">“Then, does anyone want to try it out now—?”</p>
<p id="line_3361">I doubted anyone would, yet <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked away anyway. She was a lot bolder than I expected.</p>
<p id="line_3362">“Hmph, you won’t die in the labyrinth? That’s some real funny shit. I’m not gonna fall for your bullshit rhetoric!”</p>
<p id="line_3363">The bald, strong man—Basson—exclaimed as the others nodded in agreement, as if saying, “Sure, sure, much agreed.”</p>
<p id="line_3364"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party also didn’t want to volunteer.</p>
<p id="line_3365">“Isn’t that simple enough? Mister over there, how about you step up for the demonstration,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> the ‘Splendacious Sword Fighter’ pointed at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3366">He didn’t want to do it himself, and instead pointed at someone else to try—but fine, I suppose that was reasonable.</p>
<p id="line_3367">The way he spoke, however, was not as respectable.</p>
<p id="line_3368">“Me? Your proposal does make sense, so I shall accept.”</p>
<p id="line_3369"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, now appointed, seemed to have anticipated how things would develop. He didn’t look particularly moved by it.</p>
<p id="line_3370">Especially since we actually had people experience it in real life already.</p>

At the same time, many challengers also entered with him.</p>

<p id="line_3380">I almost lost control, yet I saw a smirk on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s face. I immediately calmed down at the scene.

It was like nothing had happened. He reappeared at the surface, near the temporary entrance at the center of the stage. Even all of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s clothes turned into light and he revived with his original appearance.</p>
<p id="line_3381">These scenes were all recorded by the Dryads using the crystal balls and passed onto the projector as the footage was shown on the large screen.</p>
<p id="line_3382">“Please have a look everyone, all my limbs are fine as before!”</p>

His cut arm was restored to its original state, bringing us the best performance of the day.</p>
<p id="line_3384">“OHOOOO!”</p>
<p id="line_3385">The crowd gave off waves of loud cheers, some even shouting, “That was a miracle!” Our goal was reached most excellently.

<p id="line_3386">For people who still didn’t believe at this point, we would just have to invite them to experience it for themselves. However, at the end of the day, these mechanisms were for the worst-case scenario. We would still prefer it if people acted cautiously. Being unable to die was all well and good, but it was best if they didn’t have to experience it in the first place.</p>
<p id="line_3387">That’s why we only needed to wait for adventurers who visited the labyrinth to leak such news. Some nut-job challengers would probably want to try it out themselves. But that wouldn’t be a problem either.</p>

In times like this, how did they manage to achieve their goals? Could it be that they had hired people to lead the way every single time…</p>
<p id="line_3398">“Tsk, why are we always walking down the same road! What the hell, these are all quadrilaterals!”</p>
<p id="line_3399">“Boss, didn’t we just walk along this road as well?”</p>
<p id="line_3400">Before my worries could have been relayed to them, these people were already lost. We did mention that the area was extremely wide during the explanation, weren’t they listening?</p>
<p id="line_3401">“Basson, this is bad! This labyrinth is larger than we imagined…”</p>
<p id="line_3402"><em>Ah, I get it.</em></p>
<p id="line_3403">The first floor of the labyrinth alone was around 250 meters long on each side. We did mention that it was big, but these people seemed to have thought it would be smaller. It is likely that they didn’t think the area was all that large when they heard that the labyrinth was a man-made facility underneath the colosseum.</p>
<p id="line_3404">I supposed that was fine, as long as they helped with the promotion, it would be okay. But we couldn’t let them die on the first floor right out of the gates. If they ended up making it look like the labyrinth was so unfairly difficult, then no one would want to challenge it.</p>
<p id="line_3405">I hoped that they could at least progress to a certain extent. They could come back if killed anyway, the bracelet had the savior function. Using that mechanic, they could escape from the labyrinth, but they would be considered killed. Alpha and the other dryads would then go to assist.</p>
<p id="line_3406">This time they were even accompanying all of the contestants, so the dryads could forcefully teleport them back to the surface, if need be. That’s why I hoped they would relax a bit and progress through the labyrinth carefully, and maybe even start taking it seriously from now on…</p>
<p id="line_3407">Being inundated by his companions’ woes had made Basson look disgruntled.</p>
<p id="line_3408">“Are your heads full of shit? There’s no way any labyrinth is that big. These are all tricks of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; he’s trying to send us off the trail with magic.”</p>
<p id="line_3409">“Y-yeah!”</p>
<p id="line_3410">“As expected from Basson-aniki!”</p>
<p id="line_3411">“Indeed, there’s a dense layer of magicule here. As you have said, this is likely some hallucination or illusion magic at work.”</p>
<p id="line_3412">“That’s right, Gomez. From the start, we have always taken right turns at the intersections, in other words, we can easily turn around and go back the way we came.”</p>
<p id="line_3413">No way, the problem was not the difficulty. Their plan sounded very comprehensive, but in reality, that wasn’t the case. It’d be okay for them to have taken notes on paper or other items, however, since the hallways all had similar looking walls along them, they couldn’t possibly remember every single one of them. There were also crossroads and T-intersections, as well as dead ends. There was complex terrain combined with almost identical scenery. Not even the first floor could be beaten by turning to the right every time.</p>
<p id="line_3414">The challengers were just too stupid. <em>Looks like I best not put too much hope into these people</em>…</p>
<p id="line_3415">But just as I thought so—</p>
<p id="line_3416">Basson’s party vanished, or rather, they fell down to the next floor.</p>
<p id="line_3417">“A-are…! Did they just fall into a trap?” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, sharing my same confusion. <em>Was there a fall trap set on the first floor?</em></p>
<p id="line_3418">“Ramiris—”</p>
<p id="line_3419">“U-umm, w-what?”</p>
<p id="line_3420">“—Nothing serious, it’s just that I was the one who designed that floor. I don’t recall little tricks like that, could it be you who made the change without my permission?”</p>
<p id="line_3421">My eyes narrowed as a smile hung on my face. This was to not scare Ramiris. Although, I had also locked my hands around her body in a vice grip to prevent her from escaping, before asking her the question.</p>
<p id="line_3422">“A-about that, it was because we wanted to further the completion of the labyrinth…” Ramiris answered with an ingratiating smile.</p>
<p id="line_3423">After some more persistent interrogation, she admitted to having set up an enormous amount of fall traps herself.</p>
<p id="line_3424">I angrily cursed as Ramiris, “You idiot!”</p>
<p id="line_3425"><em>Missy, do you know that we don’t need fall traps on a wide-area floor?</em> The point of them is to get people lost in order to reduce their stamina. Having fall traps that gave them shortcuts would serve the opposite effect. A trap is only useful if its purpose aligns with the intended goal of a floor.</p>
<p id="line_3426">“B-but there are more vicious fall traps down in the lower floors. So I really was just wondering if you had forgotten to set one up in that area or something, my intention was all good.”</p>
<p id="line_3427">She just <em>loved</em> poking her nose around other people’s business.</p>
<p id="line_3428"><em>While it was bad to have set that trap up in the first place, the least you could’ve done was prepare a pit of needles at the bottom</em>. Ramiris, Veldora, Milim; I knew these three would mess up when laying the traps. That’s why I personally designed the first floor…</p>
<p id="line_3429">I hurried to confirm the status of the other teams.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3430">First was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party.</p>
<p id="line_3431">Cabal was originally the leader, but right now <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had taken control. These people all had a terrible sense of direction, my guess was that they would have difficulty in even getting through the first floor. But my guess was only half right.</p>
<p id="line_3432"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party wasn’t tricked by the fall traps, instead they were progressing very carefully. Surprisingly, they were neatly writing down relevant information about their progress on paper; it’s the classic dungeon walkthrough strategy.</p>
<p id="line_3433">“Ho? <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the boys are so careful. They haven’t stepped on any traps, even avoiding ones that I’ve set. They’ve also found their third treasure chest. They are progressing way too smoothly…”</p>
<p id="line_3434">“—Ehehe.”</p>
<p id="line_3435"><em>What the heck? Something about this seems off.</em></p>
<p id="line_3436"><em>Why are they doing so well?</em></p>
<p id="line_3437">There was also one more thing that had caught my attention, Ramiris seemed to be trying to hide something with her smile right now.</p>
<p id="line_3438">“…Oi, Ramiris.”</p>
<p id="line_3439">“W-what?!”</p>
<p id="line_3440">“I have a lot of faith in you, but could there be anything that you are hiding from me?”</p>
<p id="line_3441">“O-of course, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>!”</p>
<p id="line_3442">“Then let me ask you this, did you do something with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party?”</p>
<p id="line_3443">Judging by this screen alone, there was nothing out of the ordinary. However, their current record seems way too suspicious. Regarding the treasure chests set by me, most of them, naturally, were empty, yet they had found items inside them three times in a row. There was a good chance that they had been cheating.</p>
<p id="line_3444">“A-about that…”</p>
<p id="line_3445"><em>Again?</em></p>
<p id="line_3446">“What did you do?”</p>
<p id="line_3447">“Ah, I did. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and her companions sent some gifts, so we were just chatting and having a good time! And then—”</p>
<p id="line_3448">…</p>
<p id="line_3449">It hurt my head just listening.</p>
<p id="line_3450">While Ramiris and the others were busy building the labyrinth, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> sent a bunch of cakes to them. They were experimental products made by Yoshida-san, which must have been delicious. As <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was sending the gifts, she became acquainted with the dryads, and through them, she managed to extract a bunch of information about the first floor.</p>
<p id="line_3451">Halfway through, Ramiris also found it odd, but the charm of the cakes was too irresistible for her…</p>
<p id="line_3452">“You can’t blame me this time! It wasn’t just me, even Mentor and Milim said it was fine!”</p>
<p id="line_3453">And she got desperate and began to argue how she was right. I was dumbfounded at this blatant act of bribery. I didn’t expect her to become corrupted so quickly.</p>
<p id="line_3454">But with that being said, it wasn’t as severe as I had imagined.</p>
<p id="line_3455">I did lower the difficulty of progression during the festival, and they only got information on one floor anyway. The really good treasure chests were not on that floor anyway.</p>
<p id="line_3456">“Cabal’s team has been successfully acquiring treasure chests from the start.”</p>
<p id="line_3457">“Indeed, according to His Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, there will be treasure chests placed in various locations, such as small rooms. There are also traps mixed in with them, so you have to be careful.”</p>
<p id="line_3458">“I see! Are there any precious items inside as well?”</p>
<p id="line_3459">“There will be on lower levels. Eh—speaking of it… The treasure chests are apparently categorized with three different variations. Those being bronze, silver and gold colors. I heard that only the bronze ones may be laden with traps.”</p>
<p id="line_3460">The three different treasure chests contained different rewards, and there would only be bronze chests on the first floor. Inside these, you would, at most, find high-grade items, usually things such as a healing potion or silver coins. The rest would be failed creations from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciples, a.k.a. run-of-the-mill gear. If this was what adventurers wanted, we weren’t losing much through that process.</p>
<p id="line_3461">“Surely, their goal would be the golden chests, right?”</p>
<p id="line_3462">“That’s likely the case. However, golden chests will exclusively appear in boss rooms, which are found on every tenth floor.”</p>
<p id="line_3463">“What does that mean?”</p>
<p id="line_3464">“Let me put it this way. I’m sure that everyone already knows <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, who’s the guardian of the 50<sup>th</sup> floor of the dungeon. By that deduction, there are similar rooms on the 40<sup>th</sup>, 30<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> floors, guarded by a “Floor Guardian.” Only by defeating these strong foes, will you be able to open the golden chests. They are said to even have rare-grade gear inside them!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> explained while reading off the note that I had given him.</p>
<p id="line_3465">Our goal this time was to advertise, so we had to utilize opportunities like this. Although, those words did sound highly suspicious, like some promotion on a late-night TV show. Even I, the writer of the note, felt a bit shameful hearing them, though those words were meant to stimulate people’s desire.</p>
<p id="line_3466">It did have a tremendous effect however, “rare-grade gear” caused quite the disturbance at the venue.</p>
<p id="line_3467">“Everyone has witnessed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s ability. That strong man is awaiting fellow challengers, to those who are confident in your abilities, you should try to challenge him!”</p>
<p id="line_3468">“There’s one more thing. As everyone has seen, the floors are quite vast; I hope that people will be mentally prepared for a single walkthrough taking up several days,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> answered, providing answers to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s doubts. The two were a fantastic duo, as both the live broadcasters and commentators.</p>
<p id="line_3469">I confirmed once more that there were only bronze chests on the first floor.</p>
<p id="line_3470">“—Are you sure you haven’t touched the contents of the treasure chests?”</p>
<p id="line_3471">“That, you can rest assured!”</p>
<p id="line_3472"><em>Okay then.</em></p>
<p id="line_3473">After all, their method of progressing was almost a classic strategy, it would be great for promotion. Although I did mind the fact that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party was playing tricks, I might as well just let them have those trinkets as a reward. It was definitely foul play to have obtained a map as well as the trap locations, but I’d close one eye for them this time. I already knew that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party would be fine now.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3474">Time to check on <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, who I had leaked information to…</p>
<p id="line_3475">“OH OH—okay, now this is epic. They are already entering the fourth floor! The team known as “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shining" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” is as the name suggests. They’re zipping through at the speed of light.”</p>
<p id="line_3476"><em>PEW!</em></p>
<p id="line_3477">How was that possible? They had only started the walkthrough less than thirty minutes ago, and they had somehow already gotten to the fourth floor! <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party must’ve intentionally stepped on fall traps and cheesed their way to the lower levels.</p>
<p id="line_3478">As for the audience’s reaction—“MA-SA-YU-KI, MA-SA-YU-KIIII!”</p>
<p id="line_3479"><em>Could’ve guessed that from a mile away.</em></p>
<p id="line_3480">The same audience that had mocked Basson’s party for falling down the trap, instead gave <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> their approval and praise. This was a bit too ridiculous, but it <em>was </em><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s power.</p>
<p id="line_3481">I figured that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must’ve been terribly pissed at me right now, thinking that the information I gave him was bogus… <em>Sorry, that’s not my fault.</em> But anything sounded like an excuse at this point.</p>
<p id="line_3482">After reaching the fourth floor, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to patrol the roads. Relying on an incomplete map, that was missing a bunch of fall traps, must’ve been frightening. I still prayed to myself that he would do his best.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3483">Let’s check on the last guy—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3484">This man was sprinting through the labyrinth, making good use of his physical prowess. Delta was flying around tirelessly trying to catch up with him. She was a semi-spiritual life form (half spirit, half living being), able to use ‘Teleportation’ via the vegetation. However, doing so would disrupt the live video feed she was supposed to relay. That must’ve been why she was trying so hard to keep pace with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> by flying after him. Her dedication and enthusiasm towards her work was truly commendable. Despite Delta struggling, with the fear of falling behind, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> couldn’t have cared less, instead keeping up his steady pace while dashing through hallway after hallway. He kept on sprinting towards the stairs without ever getting lost, he appeared to be using magic or other means to gain knowledge of his surroundings.</p>
<p id="line_3485">«Answer. It is the effect of Elemental Magic “Map Generation.”»</p>
<p id="line_3486">So, you could also do that when you didn’t have a map at hand. It seemed to be the type of magic used by ‘<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Great Sage" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’ in the past. Magic like that could generate information about locations in his brain, that is, if he could cast the magic consistently. It seemed that not only was he skilled in the sword, he was also good with magic. He sure had some tricks up his sleeve.</p>
<p id="line_3487">I did inquire about him from Fuze, and it turned out that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was indeed the rare A Rank personnel. No wonder he had abilities like that.</p>
<p id="line_3488">He was currently tearing through the second floor and would be reaching the stairs soon. At this rate, it would take him another two hours before he reached the fifth floor. That was a lot faster than I expected, I never anticipated their progress to be so fast.</p>
<p id="line_3489">There’s something else that was bothering me however—it was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s unusual expression. His mouth was twisted grotesquely, and his eyes were bloodshot…</p>
<p id="line_3490">By the time he reached the third floor, he hadn’t shown any signs of slowing down either. But unlike the first and second floors, he wasn’t even skipping a single small room—he was checking for treasure chests. Or perhaps it was the opposite case—he seemed to know where the treasure chests were at and was able to find the rooms with treasure chests effortlessly.</p>
<p id="line_3491">He was also only picking the silver chests.</p>
<p id="line_3492">“This guy… How’s he doing that?” I muttered to myself. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei didn’t respond. Looked like even sensei didn’t know.</p>
<p id="line_3493">“I feel that this <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> guy has an especially strong desire. Is he perhaps the type that can even sniff out money?” Ramiris commented coldly, while I understood somewhat.</p>
<p id="line_3494">In any case, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was definitely not any ordinary person. What he did to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was also unpleasant, so if possible, I hoped that we wouldn’t be dealing with such a character any longer.</p>
<p id="line_3495">In this way, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s labyrinth strategy also made rapid headway.</p>

<p id="line_3499">One of his companions discovered the door on accident.</p>
<p id="line_3500">“Could this be another trap?” Basson asked, his face filled with doubts.</p>
<p id="line_3501">Just now, they had been battling the trapped treasure chests filled with paralyzing toxin and sleeping gas. There was also a rather weak mimic they fought. They had developed PTSD from treasure chests.</p>
<p id="line_3502">“Oi, Ramiris. What’s in the room of that treasure chest? If this continues, it won’t have any good promotional effect, even I am starting to feel sorry for them, so it’s about time for them to get something good…”</p>
<p id="line_3503">How should I put it, seeing how these people were getting tricked reminded me of the gacha game I played, and the sour memory of ten rolls of absolute garbage. After getting all that trash before, their misfortune weighed even on me. If they ended up losing their motivation, they wouldn’t be coming back in the future… That’s why I thought it was about time to give them some grand prize.</p>
<p id="line_3504">“D-don’t worry. It was because those challengers sucked… Although it’s not fair for me to say so, I really didn’t expect them to be that reckless. B-but that room has one <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and a silver chest. I don’t remember what was in it, but they will definitely get something good this time!”</p>
<p id="line_3505"><em>Fine, that should do it. I hope they will encounter at least something nice today—</em></p>
<p id="line_3506">“AHH! It’s a trap again, there’s even a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in here!”</p>
<p id="line_3507">“Tsk, how about we retreat for now?”</p>
<p id="line_3508">“We can’t, Basson. It’s already onto us!”</p>
<p id="line_3509">“It’s a great-bear! It won’t be easy for us to escape…”</p>
<p id="line_3510">The two sides were already staring at each other, observing what sort of move they would be making.</p>
<p id="line_3511"><em>—Eh, what is this?</em></p>
<p id="line_3512">Only one <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appeared, there’s no way you needed to panic like that. There was only a slim chance for a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to already appear on the first floor, and there wouldn’t be any strong ones on the second floor either. Yet this hidden room had a silver chest containing some quality reward. A strong <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was deployed to guard this chest… This hidden grand prize on the second floor.</p>
<p id="line_3513">Yet it only had a great-bear, a measly Rank C <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Basson’s team, with a combined strength of Ranked B, could easily take care of them. Despite this, Basson and Gomez were shocked upon seeing the great-bear.</p>
<p id="line_3514">“Basson-aniki, there’s a treasure chest there!”</p>
<p id="line_3515">“It’s silver.”</p>
<p id="line_3516">“It may be trapped again, but all we can do now is fight. Alright everyone, get ready!”</p>
<p id="line_3517">“Copy that!”</p>
<p id="line_3518">“Let’s go, let’s go!”</p>
<p id="line_3519">It seemed that Basson’s six-man team finally made up their mind to fight. As they were staring at the great-bear, the team carefully raised their weapons.</p>
<p id="line_3520">“I’ll be the bait; you guys take the chance and attack!”</p>
<p id="line_3521">Basson really had the composure of a leader, he’d decided to be a competent tank. He rushed into the room and shouted, diverting all of the great-bear’s attention to him.</p>
<p id="line_3522">Basson and the great-bear confronted each other face-to-face.</p>
<p id="line_3523">“Oh! Basson’s party appears to be engaging a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in battle! Their opponent is a great-bear? I heard that one swing of its giant paw can easily take someone’s life—”</p>
<p id="line_3524">I finally realized my mistake after hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s explanation.</p>
<p id="line_3525"><em>Right, this isn’t actually a video game.</em></p>
<p id="line_3526">Basson and his men were, after all, professional adventurers. They didn’t want any of their men to be injured. Even the slightest misstep could have cost them their lives, and so they would most definitely avoid fighting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> that yielded no profit. Even though they didn’t really need to worry about dying in there, it would take some time for people to actually accept such a mindset.</p>
<p id="line_3527"><em>With that in mind, perhaps I should re-evaluate how I’ve been trying to promote the labyrinth…</em></p>
<p id="line_3528">And soon, the battle began.</p>
<p id="line_3529">Basson lunged forward to take on the great-bear’s attack. A look of desperation was etched on his face. The only thing between him and the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a worn-out piece of leather armor. A piece that didn’t cover up his entire body and left his hands and lower sides completely exposed. He found himself in quite the precarious situation despite confronting an opponent weaker than himself. His great axe could land heavy chopping blows, yet it was not suitable to defend against a bear’s claws. That’s why Basson had been using his round shield to deflect the great-bear’s paw.</p>
<p id="line_3530">His companions, on the other hand, were covering for Basson. To keep themselves safe, they were targeting the eyes and feet of the great-bear when launching attacks. The magician named Gomez, meanwhile, launched the great-magic spell Wind Slash to take its life.</p>
<p id="line_3531">“And it’s at this moment that their battle to the death with the great-bear concludes! An excellent fight!”</p>
<p id="line_3532">“Indeed. Their actions were very logical and devoid of unnecessary complications. That was the style of experienced fighters.”</p>
<p id="line_3533">As I listened to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s broadcast, I mulled over the fight just now. Indeed, their teamwork was flawless. In the end, there were no casualties in Basson’s team, and they took around five minutes to take down the great-bear.</p>
<p id="line_3534">But I couldn’t shake off the troubles as new problems started to emerge.</p>
<p id="line_3535">“Oi oi oi, I didn’t expect them to fight so cautiously against an enemy far weaker than themselves…”</p>
<p id="line_3536">“Um—I was surprised too. But shouldn’t that normally be the case?”</p>
<p id="line_3537">“I suppose. Although not having drawn a map is indicative of poor performance, we seem to have underestimated their abilities.”</p>
<p id="line_3538">“That’s true, maybe it will take three days just to break through the first floor alone…”</p>
<p id="line_3539">“Um—if that’s the case, we should really think about quantifying the rations…”</p>
<p id="line_3540">I didn’t expect our project to be disrupted by something like this.</p>
<p id="line_3541">Basson’s team had teammates of varying ranks, but their overall strength was the equivalent of Rank B. As for Basson and Gomez, with their good equipment, they may have been around Rank B in terms of skill. Yet we couldn’t have anticipated that such a six-man team had to struggle in a fight on the second floor already.</p>
<p id="line_3542">In terms of results alone, it was their complete victory, though taking five minutes was perhaps way too long. However, as professional adventurers, they might also value safety more…</p>
<p id="line_3543">Maybe they should be taught to adapt different fighting strategies, perhaps they could adhere to the strategy of “Use healing potions even if it’s only a scratch” to improve their combat efficiency.</p>
<p id="line_3544">Not sure why I was worried, but right now Basson’s party was approaching the treasure chest.</p>
<p id="line_3545">“It looks like the room contained a treasure chest, it looks silver as well, what could possibly be inside…?”</p>
<p id="line_3546"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s words had tensed up the audience. While the other teams had opened treasure chests several times by now, people were still highly interested in the instant that they were opened.</p>
<p id="line_3547">One of Basson’s teammates went up and immediately threw the lid open.</p>
<p id="line_3548"><em>Oi oi oi, shouldn’t you at least check for traps?</em></p>
<p id="line_3549">Silver chests weren’t set with traps, but Basson’s team had no clue of that. Just before this, they had gotten poisoned with paralysis and enveloped with sleeping gas. They also seemed to be taking turns when opening chests, but this wasn’t a punishment game… Their crude way of opening the chest even put me, as a spectator, on edge.</p>
<p id="line_3550">In this regard, in the eyes of me, an epic gamer, I could only call them amateurs.</p>
<p id="line_3551">Having treasure chests inside labyrinths was a foreign concept to people here…is that why they were so quick to do something so reckless? From this point of view, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party was at least somewhat better. Their team had Gido, who, so far, had ensured that they wouldn’t trigger any traps while extracting items from treasure chests.</p>
<p id="line_3552">Basson’s team’s issue probably came down to them not having a thief. Professional adventurers that exterminated <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were probably the buff type who weren’t suited for situations like this. They should have hired teammates specializing in exploration.</p>
<p id="line_3553"><em>Hold up?</em></p>
<p id="line_3554">It may be that the difficulty of the labyrinth was higher than we expected. I thought that the issue was Basson’s party not being professional enough, but it would seem that a lot of people were simply not good at exploring a labyrinth. Their walkthrough couldn’t be made faster.</p>
<p id="line_3555">I needed to reflect on the issue.</p>
<p id="line_3556">“OH, WOWOWO! Basson-aniki, it’s a sword!”</p>
<p id="line_3557"><em>NICU!</em></p>
<p id="line_3558">They seemed to have hit the jackpot. Moreover, the rare-grade jackpot deluxe. There were many different types of rewards, such as high-grade healing potions, ancient gold coins, or fine quality gear etc. We also designed it so that, starting from level two, there would be a very low chance of the reward being a rare-grade item.</p>
<p id="line_3559">What Basson got was a rare-grade sword.</p>
<p id="line_3560">“By the way, Mentor said that all of the treasure chests were designed to have higher reward drop rates!”</p>
<p id="line_3561">“I-is that so? But so far they have been getting shit rewards all around…”</p>
<p id="line_3562">It was rare for Veldora to be so generous, yet it was ruined by Basson’s bad luck. No, had Veldora not raised the probability, they could have been getting shit gear even now.</p>
<p id="line_3563">With that being said, obtaining this rare-grade sword was a game-changer for them. This would be great for publicity. Basson’s team would probably also want to test their luck even more. Upon thinking so, I had to compliment Veldora with a “Good job.”</p>
<p id="line_3564">“For Veldora, this decision has been amazing. If you failed to leave these folks with some good memories, it would affect the future of the labyrinth exploration.”</p>
<p id="line_3565"><em>I’ll thank Veldora later.</em></p>
<p id="line_3566">Basson’s men whistled upon laying eyes on the sword.</p>
<p id="line_3567">They seemed to be very fond of the treasure.</p>
<p id="line_3568">“You guys, let’s keep on going at this pace!”</p>
<p id="line_3569">Basson sheathed his great axe and changed his weapon to the sword.</p>
<p id="line_3570">In the next room, three Rank D bats appeared, all cut down by him in one smooth slash. The quality of the sword had perhaps added a bonus to their overall effectiveness, they seemed to have become faster in dealing with enemies.</p>
<p id="line_3571">This was a sword crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s disciple. It barely made it to the level of rare-grade, however, to Basson’s party, it was a mighty sword, nonetheless.</p>
<p id="line_3572"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was no exception in this regard. I heard that even the elite of Rank A had difficulty in gathering a full set of rare-grade gear. No wonder why Basson and his boys were so happy.</p>
<p id="line_3573">As if they were making up for their previous losses, the party pushed forward confidently. In addition, they also seemed to have obtained many “Magic Crystals” from the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3574">“This sword is really nice, now we’re making some profit. We may make more money than we expected.”</p>
<p id="line_3575">“That’s right, when this labyrinth is officially opened, we gotta come back for more!”</p>
<p id="line_3576">They chatted joyfully.</p>
<p id="line_3577">And so, Basson’s party continued their walkthrough—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3578">Let’s have a look at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s team.</p>
<p id="line_3579">They were staying on the first floor, where it was difficult to find rare-grade gear. These folks were operating cautiously with safety in mind. One could say that they were overly cautious. But for that same reason, they were also able to pick all the treasure chests clean on the first floor, with the smoothest progression. Yet to their surprise, there was a turn of events.</p>
<p id="line_3580">“Have we farmed enough?”</p>
<p id="line_3581">“Are we really going there now?”</p>
<p id="line_3582">“Uh… Aren’t you going to ask me about it…?”</p>
<p id="line_3583">“Of course we are going! We’re gonna make it big this time!”</p>
<p id="line_3584">Cabal’s opinion was completely ignored as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party started making their way downstairs. With less than an hour left, they seemed to have set their minds on achieving their goal.</p>
<p id="line_3585">Their reason for staying on the first floor for that long was apparently to collect potions. They had also made full use of the information that Ramiris gave them, setting their target at the tenth level.</p>
<p id="line_3586">“Oh, Cabal’s party seems to be on the move. Switching gears from the conservative strategy and deciding to go all the way down.”</p>
<p id="line_3587">“Hmm—perhaps they’ve changed their strategy in order to find better treasure chests? However, relying on luck alone to find them won’t be an easy task…”</p>
<p id="line_3588">“But just like Basson’s team back there, won’t silver chests also give you a rare-grade item?”</p>
<p id="line_3589">“That’s not something you can get just by wishing for it. Look at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san, he’s opened more than twenty silver chests, yet his current rare-grade item count is still zero.”</p>
<p id="line_3590">“Does that mean the only way to ensure you get a rare-grade drop is through a golden chest?”</p>
<p id="line_3591">“That’s right. However, golden chests only appear in specific locations within the boss room, otherwise it will be…”</p>
<p id="line_3592">“There are other places?”</p>
<p id="line_3593">“Uh… There seem to be areas where you may stumble upon large regional <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. It is said that a room guarded by this type of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> will also have a golden chest.”</p>
<p id="line_3594">Upon hearing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s conversation, I had an idea of what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> intended to do.</p>
<p id="line_3595">“Oi, Ramiris.”</p>
<p id="line_3596">“I’m here.”</p>
<p id="line_3597">“Did you leak information about the spawn point of the region boss?”</p>
<p id="line_3598">“About that…”</p>
<p id="line_3599">“Did you or not?”</p>
<p id="line_3600">“Uhhh! It seems to have been a part of it!”</p>
<p id="line_3601"><em>Wow. Actually, I should think positively.</em></p>
<p id="line_3602">An entertaining region boss would add to the promotional effect—I thought to myself. I recalled putting it near the fourth floor. Once it got beaten, it would change position, so right now it should still be there…</p>
<p id="line_3603">In this malignant <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> room, you would have to deal with several Rank C-plus vampiric bats first. People entering without any knowledge would be swarmed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, however, they could handle it if they were aware of the situation. However, there may be the red herring that tricked people into thinking that they had already figured out what awaited them inside. That would lead them into a world of hurt.</p>
<p id="line_3604">—While I was worried up until that point, it turned out that this was all for naught.</p>
<p id="line_3605"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party intentionally used the trap to fall straight to the fifth floor. They pretended to be injured in order to shill the effect of the healing potion. Later, with the excuse of finding a resting place, they moved towards their actual destination.</p>
<p id="line_3606"><em>They’ve done everything perfectly, what fine actors.</em></p>
<p id="line_3607">“Big bro, big sis, there’s a room just around the corner, let’s go rest when we get there.”</p>
<p id="line_3608">“Alright! By the way, are you alright, Cabal?”</p>
<p id="line_3609">“Um, uhhh. This healing potion sure is effective. Although I think I’m already fully recovered, let’s go rest up before earning another pile of fat loot.”</p>
<p id="line_3610">Cabal was the only one that gave a rigid delivery, yet the audience didn’t notice. They were mesmerized by the events taking place on the screen. It was then that Gido opened the door of the room.</p>
<p id="line_3611">“WOH! There are vampiric bats here!”</p>
<p id="line_3612">“Don’t worry. Cabal, we’ll be counting on you!”</p>
<p id="line_3613">“…But I don’t want to get my blood sucked.”</p>
<p id="line_3614">Cabal’s resistance was futile, the battle began.</p>
<p id="line_3615">He raised his scale shield and hid behind it, taking on the attack of the vampiric bats by himself. While the situation looked dire to the uninitiated, Cabal was unfazed. Since the vampiric bats couldn’t really break through the toughness of the shield, he stopped the attack without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p id="line_3616">While Cabal was attracting the attention of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> prepared to cast magic.</p>
<p id="line_3617">“Here I come! Giant Magic Icicle Shotguuuun!”</p>
<p id="line_3618">A salvo of tiny shards of sharp ice rained down on the vampiric bats. The small room they were in made it impossible to escape the barrage. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s magic power was enhanced by her dryad staff. The vampiric bats were exterminated without a trace.</p>
<p id="line_3619">“Eh—this looked a bit too simple.”</p>
<p id="line_3620">“Yeah, had this been Basson’s team, it would be a battle of life and death…”</p>
<p id="line_3621">“We seem to be running at a deficit by giving them the golden chest that easily.”</p>
<p id="line_3622">“But it’s a bit of a stretch to view <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party as the norm.”</p>
<p id="line_3623"><em>Indeed, Ramiris had a point.</em></p>
<p id="line_3624">Upon second thought, it was only made this easy due to them cheating. Normally, there was no way things could have gone that smoothly. If anyone ended up finding the golden chest by running around in the labyrinth, we should definitely give them our congratulations and call them the lucky ones.</p>
<p id="line_3625">“That was a beautiful fight.”</p>
<p id="line_3626">“Indeed, as expected from an experienced adventurer team. They have already held back much during the fight. Oh, Gido-san is opening the chest now.”</p>
<p id="line_3627">“Oh oh! It’s a golden chest, will it really have a rare-grade item?”</p>
<p id="line_3628">As I listened to the commentary, I turned my eyes to Gido’s hands.</p>
<p id="line_3629">It was definitely going to be a rare-grade item, what would he get though?</p>
<p id="line_3630">“This is…a sword…”</p>
<p id="line_3631">“But I wanted defensive gear for magicians.”</p>
<p id="line_3632">“Did you just say sword? Wonderful, I guess the old man above knows how hard I’ve been working!”</p>
<p id="line_3633">The three all had different expressions. Gido seemed rather perplexed, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> looked upset, and Cabal’s previous unmotivated expression had been ejected out of his system. Each of their reactions was interesting.</p>
<p id="line_3634">“Oh oh, there really was a weapon, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san!”</p>
<p id="line_3635">“Aha, that is for certain.

<p id="line_3637">The item from the golden chest was a storm long sword.</p>
<p id="line_3638">Everyone seemed to think that it was a rare-grade item, yet it was in fact an authentic special-grade weapon. Just like the storm short saber I gifted Gido, it was a mighty sword crafted by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> using a scale of Charybdis. It was likely due to the fact that Veldora had raised the probability of the reward rolls, that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had gotten the one-in-a-hundred chance to get the top-tier item.</p>
<p id="line_3639">With their goals accomplished, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party immediately returned to the surface.</p>
<p id="line_3640"><em>Should I call these fellows too realistic…</em></p>
<p id="line_3641">“We seemed to have given away too big of a prize this time, but never mind.”</p>
<p id="line_3642">Due to the courageous act of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party, I could only answer with a wry smile.</p>
<p id="line_3643">And so, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s party returned early, before the time limit.</p>

<p id="line_3645">The two parties were pretty much racing each other to the bottom floors. However, their difference was obvious.</p>

<p id="line_3647">“These guys were way too fast…”</p>

With around fifteen minutes left on the clock, they were already on the tenth floor. As a result of taking a short cut with the fall trap, they had landed onto a perfect spot near the deepest room on the tenth floor.</p>
<p id="line_3651">It must have been this way due to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s good luck as well.</p>
<p id="line_3652">“Less than three hours and they managed to reach that place…”</p>
<p id="line_3653">In light of such incredible speed, I was utterly baffled.</p>
<p id="line_3654">Upon arriving on these floors, there will be <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> appearing on the roads.

<p id="line_3655">Apart from the fall traps, all the other information I gave matched up with reality.

<p id="line_3656">They finally reached the deepest room.</p>
<p id="line_3657">The stairs leading to the eleventh floor would only appear after defeating the Level Boss in this hall. The floor guardian here was a great-spider with a difficulty level of Rank B.</p>
<p id="line_3658">Its majesty was truly fearsome—</p>

<p id="line_3663">Upon seeing this, I decided to remove all fall traps.

<p id="line_3667">“His speed was so fast, that by the time the trap had triggered, he was already far and away. That is a rather surprising strategy, not one that any average person could adapt.”</p>

<p id="line_3683"><em>Ah, he finally said it.</em></p>
<p id="line_3684">He shamelessly said, in front of the labyrinth manager no less, that he was gonna ignore the rules.

There was no way they wouldn’t feel surprised to witness such a scene with their own eyes.</p>
<p id="line_3700">Reading the current mood, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> began to comment calmly.</p>

<p id="line_3705">While there was a punishment for violators, it wasn’t much in reality.

However, he had been in a coma since. After all, the punishment this time had a lot more punch to it.

<p id="line_3709"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> would more or less reflect on himself now.</p>
<p id="line_3710">“As long as you follow the rules, the safety mechanism of the ‘Revival Bracelet’ will be intact. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san decided to ignore the rule. In this establishment, adventurers are barred from in-fights. You will also have to listen to the advice of the labyrinth managers. There are many detailed regulations. We will be releasing a pamphlet regarding the must-know after our official opening. The receptionist will explain it to those who are illiterate. In order to prevent anyone from getting <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san’s treatment, I hope all will abide by the regulations.”</p>
<p id="line_3711">“And with the outcome like this, it is quite a shame for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san. But after the official opening, if you wait for a while, the floor boss will be revived! Fights among adventurers are also forbidden. Please adhere to the rules and explore the labyrinth properly!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> announced loudly.</p>
<p id="line_3712"><em>What do you mean by exploring the labyrinth properly? She didn’t answer this question.</em></p>
<p id="line_3713">The atmosphere amidst the audience had become a bit awkward, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> managed to swing the mood back around.</p>
<p id="line_3714">During that period, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also regained consciousness, and upon recalling what had happened to him, he was both shocked and regretful.</p>
<p id="line_3715">Seeing <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> recovering, the audience gradually regained composure.</p>
<p id="line_3716"><em>This is great, this is great.</em></p>
<p id="line_3717">It looked like the audience had realized that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s comments were accurate as well. While <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was indeed annoying, observing him did yield us some useful information.</p>
<p id="line_3718">As long as we re-examined our strategy and employed countermeasures to prevent high-grade adventurers from only coming in to loot treasure chests, we wouldn’t suffer too much loss. On the other hand, this moment served to educate people on what would happen if you didn’t adhere to the rules.</p>
<p id="line_3719">And so, I was personally rather satisfied by the outcome of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s run.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3720">The current situation was that most teams had finished exploring the labyrinth, with Basson’s party still remaining. There were around ten minutes left on the clock before the scheduled deadline. It was about time to have Basson’s party end this round.</p>
<p id="line_3721">As I thought about it, I heard a scream, “YAAAA!” as one of Basson’s companions fell. He was probably ambushed by the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in the room, resulting in his right eye getting pierced by an arrow.</p>
<p id="line_3722">That’s why I said that opening a door without a care in the world was dangerous.</p>
<p id="line_3723">There was a skeleton archer sniping anyone who wished to enter the room. The second person to fall was shot right between the eyes, and, unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, his body only vanished after ten seconds. The labyrinth event was about to end, he picked the right time to die so as to experience death in the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_3724">The skeleton soldiers were taken down by the remaining four.</p>
<p id="line_3725">“W-what! There had been no casualties until now, yet two had just been killed. But rest assured everyone, the people who just died would soon be safely resurrected on the surface!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Souka" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> gave her live commentary on the state of Basson’s squad. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also helped to fill her in.</p>
<p id="line_3726">Basson’s party had a highly immersive fighting style, the audience couldn’t peel their eyes off them. Or more precisely, the rather engaging fight, visible on the big screen, had made them immerse themselves in the scene as well. Every time a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> showed up, it was met with screams and yelps from the audience. Such reactions were quite interesting.</p>
<p id="line_3727">Perhaps it was like watching a horror movie. When someone died, there were even people lamenting, as if they were at the scene.</p>
<p id="line_3728">It may be just as interesting of an event to broadcast the exploration of the labyrinth itself. Although playing any footage would probably cause some issues, we should perhaps try to negotiate with adventurers challenging the labyrinth regarding the rights to play their footage.</p>
<p id="line_3729">And just like that, I came up with this small idea.</p>
<p id="line_3730">By the time I snapped out of my thoughts, the time was almost over. The experience itself was sufficient enough. With Basson’s party, the atmosphere was unnecessarily nerve-racking. In terms of the outcome, they were very wonderful adventurers.</p>
<p id="line_3731">At the start they were still pompous enough to mock <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, saying that they would unveil the truth about the labyrinth, and that its vast landscape was but some trickery. Compared to their arrogant words from before, they seemed to have completely forgotten those things and lost themselves in the exploration of the labyrinth.</p>
<p id="line_3732">These people were shedding their manly tears and calling the names of their fallen comrades. Not only did they wallow in delusional ideas, they also liked to ignore other people’s advice. But that did seem to be how a lot of adventurers behaved. Perhaps it would prove highly valuable to use these people as a case study.</p>
<p id="line_3733">“Well then, everyone, it’s about time to get back.”</p>
<p id="line_3734">Alpha, who was in charge of Basson’s party, announced, clearly not reading the air.</p>
<p id="line_3735">Basson was frustrated by Alpha’s attitude, yet she ignored him and forcefully activated everyone’s “Return Whistle.”</p>
<p id="line_3736">“Son of a—!” the curse words slipped out of Basson’s mouth.</p>
<p id="line_3737">But as soon as they got back to the surface, he immediately ate his words.</p>
<p id="line_3738">“Ah, Basson-aniki, I really do seem to have been revived.”</p>
<p id="line_3739">His fury fizzled out as his confused companions came to welcome them.</p>
<p id="line_3740">“This is rad! Did you really get revived?”</p>
<p id="line_3741">“Yeah, I thought I was done for as well. But it didn’t hurt as I imagined; the revival was very successful.”</p>
<p id="line_3742">“What are you on about, there’s no way that’s true. There’re not many people who know revival magic, it’s all because of this bracelet!”</p>
<p id="line_3743">Basson’s party shared their joy as they chatted to confirm whether their revived companions were safe or not.</p>
<p id="line_3744">“Shit, my right eye—”</p>
<p id="line_3745">“Why don’t you try this?”</p>
<p id="line_3746">The man whose right eye was shot by an arrow, was fully healed through the potion.</p>
<p id="line_3747">“This is really awesome. For guys like us, who rely on the strength our body delivers, this is the perfect environment.”</p>
<p id="line_3748">“Is that so? We gotta try harder next time!”</p>
<p id="line_3749"><em>No no no, you were trying too hard from the get-go. The danger of potential traps didn’t even cross your minds, so I can’t imagine how you could possibly make it to the lower levels filled with them.</em></p>
<p id="line_3750">I managed to hold back all the things I want to point out about them.</p>
<p id="line_3751">The audience’s reaction was the important part. They had taken in the entirety of Basson’s party’s walkthrough and also got to learn just how safe the dungeon was.</p>
<p id="line_3752">The promotional event was arguably a huge success.</p>
<p id="line_3753">The challengers stood together on the stage. I also walked on stage and stood before them. This would be my final address towards this public demonstration of the dungeon.</p>
<p id="line_3754">“I’m not sure how everyone else felt, did you all have fun? This dungeon is planned to be open in the near future. It’s guaranteed to be safe, and we welcome those who are interested to challenge it. For those who made it to the 100<sup>th</sup> level underground, you will have the right to challenge me!”</p>
<p id="line_3755">The microphone in hand, I ended the event with this line.</p>
<p id="line_3756"><em>That was pretty good.</em> The final match just now also excited everyone, the viewing of the interior of the labyrinth also gave the audience an immersive experience.</p>
<p id="line_3757">And with that, the public demonstration of the dungeon concluded peacefully.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3758">—If it had ended there, it would’ve been perfect.</p>
<p id="line_3759">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, what’s the situation? How long do I have to wait until the challengers arrive?”</p>
<p id="line_3760"><em>He has obviously not listened to any of my words</em>, this Idiotic King of the Labyrinth Veldora had contacted me through ‘Telepathy Net.’</p>
<p id="line_3761">My good mood was completely ruined.</p>
<p id="line_3762">“So noisy, how many times do I need to tell you! Listen, there won’t be any challenger going to the bottom floor this time!”</p>
<p id="line_3763">“W-what? That’s not what you said before!”</p>
<p id="line_3764">“THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID, YOU BIG DOOFUS! You have to listen to my words carefully!”</p>
<p id="line_3765">We went on arguing for a while. This was a new low for this misbehaving brat to hit during this festival, though It was practically normal at this point. He just got too excited and messed things up. That was why, this time, I was going to criticize Veldora non-stop until he reflected on himself.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="full" id="chapter-5" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/title_cards/chapter-5.png"/></div>
<p class="pagebreak" id="line_3766"></p>
<h1 class="ch-number">Chapter 5</h1>
<h1 class="ch-name">After the Festival</h1>
<p class="no-indent" id="line_3767">On the last night of the festival, we made sure to go out with a bang, hosting a grand banquet.</p>
<p id="line_3768">Chefs like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shuna" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Yoshida-san were going all out to provide us with some breath-taking and extremely luxurious cuisine. All of this was to make a good impression on everyone.</p>
<p id="line_3769">Perhaps some new relationships had sprouted over the past three days since I could see nobles having a great time together. Unlike the first night, the mood at the banquet was a lot more relaxed.</p>
<p id="line_3770">Right, except for Veldora, Ramiris, and Milim staying inside the labyrinth, people like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Karion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Frey, and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Midley" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> all came to attend. Everyone was enjoying the night cheerfully.</p>
<p id="line_3771"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Treyni" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and the elves were also preparing dishes enthusiastically. I would have to show up with some dessert later on, as thanks.</p>
<p id="line_3772">And the townsfolk were not idle either. Visiting merchants, adventurers, nearby farmers, and the town residents were all enjoying the food and drinks in harmony. None of the stores were charging service fees tonight, it was a rowdy scene with people drinking and singing all evening. Everyone seemed to have lowered their guard, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, and humans alike, all were happily enjoying the night.</p>
<p id="line_3773">We also had music at the scene, some people were singing along to the tune, and some others were dancing to the rhythm.</p>
<p id="line_3774"><em>It’s a shame it’s going to be over so soon…</em></p>
<p id="line_3775">Starting tomorrow, everyone would be back to work. The thought of it made me sad yet excited at the same time. What a bewildering feeling. Even if I wasn’t the only one thinking along those lines, everyone was enjoying the moment.</p>
<p id="line_3776"><em>Maybe this is what happiness looks like.</em></p>
<p id="line_3777">Watching this joyous scene, I sincerely hoped that this peace could last a long, long time.</p>
<p id="line_3778">And just like that, the night quickly passed—</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_3779">After everything that happened, the festival was finally over.</p>
<p id="line_3780">In <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s absence, Rigur was kept busy taking care of security—the roads could barely contain the flood of visitors returning to their own countries.</p>
<p id="line_3781">“Wouldn’t you have wanted to sleep until noon on the day after the festival?”</p>
<p id="line_3782">“Hahaha, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama. Those foolish enough to lose themselves to things such as alcohol can’t manage the security force!”</p>
<p id="line_3783">Rigur was earnest. As expected from Rigurd’s son.</p>
<p id="line_3784">If it were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, I’m certain that he would have said something along the lines of “I wanted to sleep until the afternoon for at least the day after the festival.” Although I myself felt the same way, which is why I often spoil the guy by accident, <em>it’s for the best if I just don’t bring this up.</em></p>
<p id="line_3785">Unlike <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gobta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, Rigur swiftly ordered his subordinates to move without a single complaint. Thanks to his efforts, we were able to move the guests without any big problems.</p>
<p id="line_3786">The road was wide enough so, as long as the road wasn’t blocked by the carriages, there wouldn’t be cases where the line for humans would stop. I left the traffic control to Rigur and went back to do my own job.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3787">That’s right, today was the day I gave out gold coins as payments.</p>
<p id="line_3788">Over a hundred merchants gathered at the conference room.</p>
<p id="line_3789">Currently, Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> were sent to do the explanation, but it seemed about time for me to take the stage as well. I knew that what came next would be the main show, so I lightened myself up and went to the venue.</p>
<p id="line_3790">As I arrived at the conference room, there were noises of arguing coming out of there already.</p>
<p id="line_3791">“As I’ve said before, we will pay up the fee in time, so please calm down and wait!”</p>
<p id="line_3792">“Are you saying so just to deceive us?”</p>
<p id="line_3793">“We’ve already waited until the festival ended. Pay us our money right now!”</p>
<p id="line_3794">“Hold on for just a moment, please! You all have a point, but is it possible for you all just to sell me a favor?”</p>
<p id="line_3795">“Indeed. Are you planning to destroy our reputation after we have already introduced you to our friend <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_3796">“Let’s not put it that way, my lord. After all, we only wish to be paid by the amount promised by them—”</p>
<p id="line_3797">“That’s why I’m asking you to wait for another moment. This country is not going to run or disappear. They’ve already said that they have other means of paying than through dwarven gold coins. Can’t you guys let this pass for our sake?”</p>
<p id="line_3798">“No way we’d believe that—!”</p>
<p id="line_3799">“Yes, that’s right. Pay up already—”</p>
<p id="line_3800">It seemed like <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s friends—the big store merchants, were stepping up to comfort the retailers.</p>
<p id="line_3801">Although they may have just been acting in accordance with the way of a merchant, I still felt very happy about it. It showed that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had keen eyes when examining a person’s character<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="Therefore, who he befriends." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>.</p>
<p id="line_3802">“Now, now, everyone, how about we all calm down? I am <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, the representative for the kingdom of Guston. Even the people of the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> kingdom wouldn’t dare repudiate the debts of those people. Am I correct, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_3803"><em>Looks like there is some big shot here.</em></p>
<p id="line_3804">Representative of the kingdom of Guston—<em>in other words, does it mean he’s a noble from the trade nation Guston near <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Ingracia" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?</em></p>
<p id="line_3805">“Yes, Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama! That is correct. But—”</p>
<p id="line_3806">Hmm, although Guston was not a big nation, this was still the duke of the kingdom. Noblemen were already of high social status, and to have the title of duke implied he was some big-shot nobleman.</p>
<p id="line_3807">“Then I hope that you will reassure these people quickly. Let us proceed according to the international charter designed by the Western Nations and conclude the payment as soon as possible.”</p>
<p id="line_3808">Looked like Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was not only a powerful nobleman, but a gentleman in negotiation.</p>
<p id="line_3809">While <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a key figure in our country, as of now, he was not given neither a title of nobility nor a status. He was someone who was serving as my substitute and had only temporarily been given authority. In terms of his political stance here, he was probably the equivalent of “a guest that was invited for a meal.”</p>
<p id="line_3810">While Rigurd was present as well, not only did he remember <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s name, he even responded to him personally. Perhaps this might have been the highest degree of courtesy to him.</p>
<p id="line_3811">For a noble to remember a commoner’s name—while most nobles would not be able to remember, even those who did remember would probably just act ignorant to abide by the noble way. This was something I heard from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>; I could only imagine that he himself was the one most shocked at the scene.</p>

It’s the same to these merchants for whatever you were going to say. Trust is the most valued aspect in an exchange between nations. And trust only seeds when both sides follow through with their promises, isn’t that the case?”</p>
<p id="line_3814">“What you said was correct. But—!!”</p>
<p id="line_3815">“Shut it! These people made a deal with your people because they trusted you. Are you perhaps planning on insulting this trust?”</p>

<p id="line_3818">—<em>Ahh, now we can confirm.</em></p>
<p id="line_3819">This had unfolded just as Elmesia predicted.</p>
<p id="line_3820">It was like looking at an exam question that you had studied for, a feeling of relief that I couldn’t put into words started to flow inside me.</p>
<p id="line_3821"><em>Now we can win with ease.</em></p>
<p id="line_3822">“W-what do you mean?”</p>

As expected from an experienced merchant, he was both bold and great at acting. Just like me, he had already realized the truth, yet he continued the conversation without a change in expression.</p>
<p id="line_3824">I think the problem could have just been solved with our competent <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> alone. But if that were to be the case, I wouldn’t be able to get over my anger.</p>
<p id="line_3825"><em>Well then, let’s move out. There is no point in just listening here so let’s just quickly resolve this mess.</em></p>

<p id="line_3827">“There will be no need for that,” I announced while entering the room. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Shion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> followed. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> entered last and quietly closed the door.</p>
<p id="line_3828">“Have we kept you all waiting for too long?

<p id="line_3829">Surprised by my appearance, the merchants turned blue upon hearing those words. They probably assumed that I would leave the matter entirely to Rigurd and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to handle. But now that I had shown up with my executives like this, these people didn’t know how to react.</p>
<p id="line_3830">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has arrived. Salute at this instant,” Rigurd said while giving the merchants a hard glare.</p>
<p id="line_3831">Some of them immediately stood up and bowed in salute. But at least half of the people instead looked at me with confusion, they simply sat in their chairs and observed the situation.</p>
<p id="line_3832">Well, for retailers that did not get proper education such as the nobles, this was probably how they would react in such circumstances.</p>
<p id="line_3833">Even Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> tried to stand up, but I spoke out to stop them.</p>
<p id="line_3834">“No need to abide by the formality, Rigurd.”</p>
<p id="line_3835">After I said that with a smiling face, I glanced around the conference room. Rigurd obeyed my order and fell quiet and observed the room.</p>
<p id="line_3836">I could see not only the merchants, but also disguised reporters. It seemed like in the case of our nation doing anything inappropriate, they would go back to their respective country to report the matter.</p>
<p id="line_3837">Whether we were to cry and beg about how we couldn’t pay or to shut the merchants up with violence, no matter how we reacted, they would probably report something ridiculous regardless.</p>
<p id="line_3838">But we were already informed about that. They couldn’t expect that some of the more friendly reporters had already let <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in on the plot beforehand.</p>
<p id="line_3839"><em>Kufufufufu, how very moving for them to have such a thought</em>—<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> complimented the reporters with this line, but they only seemed to respond with a numb smile out of fear. They had probably experienced something horrible in the past and had sworn not to antagonize <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—that’s the strong will that was giving off with their reaction. They may have received some form of threat, but that was between the reporters and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3840"><em>I shouldn’t really ask too much about the matter.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3841">“I see it is Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3842">Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had quite the style of a nobleman as he bowed elegantly. He only panicked for a second upon seeing me before regaining his composure. A gentle expression emerged on his face as he greeted me in the place of everyone else at the scene.</p>
<p id="line_3843">“So you are Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> of the Guston Kingdom. Why are you here? Shouldn’t you have no business here?”</p>
<p id="line_3844">I smiled and said the line that I prepared.</p>
<p id="line_3845">There was no need for me to be timid just because he was a nobleman, so I responded quite smoothly. Practice and rehearsal sure are important.</p>
<p id="line_3846">“The thing was, a lot of these people were trading with your nation for the first time. They came complaining to me about how their legitimate rights were despised upon. It is the duty of a nobleman to protect my citizens. So I came despite knowing the rudeness of my intervention in order to have a verdict on the matter.”</p>
<p id="line_3847"><em>How shameless. This guy’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing.</em></p>
<p id="line_3848"><em>Although with that being said, I’m not any better than him, except that I’m a slime, so I’m pretty transparent.</em></p>
<p id="line_3849">“I see, how tireless of you.

<p id="line_3850">“Well, about that, it’s because these people would only accept dwarven gold coins—”</p>
<p id="line_3851"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was a good actor.

<p id="line_3852">“That is only natural. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, if you were a licensed merchant in Blumund Kingdom in the past, you should be well-versed in the international charter with regards to trade!

<p id="line_3853">He was definitely acting like a neutral third party with good intentions on purpose, trying to mend the matter for us and sell me a favor. That’s why no matter how you looked at his attitude now, it would appear justified.</p>
<p id="line_3854">But this is no different from forcing others to follow their rules.</p>
<p id="line_3855">I quickly glanced at <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_3856">Having understood, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> smiled and nodded back in response.</p>
<p id="line_3857"><em>Now we have everything prepared.</em></p>
<p id="line_3858">“I see, so that’s how it is. I was wondering what happened when I heard that reporters from all the nations gathered here. So this is for something this minor.”</p>
<p id="line_3859">“So <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, please just leave me to handle it…”</p>
<p id="line_3860">Seeing the pressure coming from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, some of the merchants were terrified. Everything seemed to be going according to plan, they were taking the bait that we were pressuring them into submission.</p>
<p id="line_3861">“Don’t get so worked up, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_3862">As I tried to calm <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> down, he seemed surprised. He almost looked unpleasant as the ordeal got interrupted despite the smooth smiling before.</p>
<p id="line_3863">“But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, I am confused. Even if we didn’t have dwarven gold coins, we still have ancient gold coins. If they won’t take that either, we can always just give them the equivalent value of our nation’s specialties. Why won’t they accept these terms?”</p>
<p id="line_3864">“I believe that the merchants surely had their reasons as well.”</p>
<p id="line_3865">I observed Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s reactions while making these conversations. It seemed like he was looking for an opening to interrupt. He wanted to be the guy to convince the merchants and lend us a favor.</p>
<p id="line_3866">“How about we do it like that? Would you first place your trust in our nation and as <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama suggested, to conclude the transaction with a certificate or actual goods?”</p>
<p id="line_3867">To finish things once and for all, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> took the first shot.</p>
<p id="line_3868">If they agreed, then everything could be concluded peacefully.</p>
<p id="line_3869">But if they were to decline…</p>
<p id="line_3870"><em>If they won’t even step down now with my presence, we will be forced to act with resolve.</em></p>

<p id="line_3874">It seemed not all of them were merchants who were not accustomed to such situations, there were people who knew how to deal with the nobles. But what they said was all incredibly selfish and didn’t consider us at all.</p>

<p id="line_3970">“Rights you say. You seemed to have been mistaken. Allow me to clarify, our nation has yet to join the Western State Council. We did have the intention to join, but it’s really not that big a deal even if we don’t.”’</p>
<p id="line_3971">“What—?”</p>
<p id="line_3972">“Well you see, this land will no doubt grow to be an important economic hub. This is an undeniable fact at this point, or at least that’s what I am driving towards.”</p>
<p id="line_3973">“What nonsense!! By what? Your own will? How dare you say something this arrogant—”</p>
<p id="line_3974">“It’s not arrogance at all. Everyone here has united to head towards the same goal. And in the end, there will only be one outcome. I’m simply part of our momentum.”</p>
<p id="line_3975">I tried to make it sound nice… But in reality, I did put what I personally wanted on priority and to make them into reality. That’s why I honestly couldn’t deny it when he called me arrogant. But nonetheless, I still managed to argue back sounding all justified.</p>
<p id="line_3976">“I also wanted to build an equal relationship with the Western State Council. But the deal’s off if they try to suppress our nation in any way. We don’t really need to play along with them as long as we trade through the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Freedom Association" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Is that understandable to you?”</p>
<p id="line_3977">Besides, even if we needed to, we could always just make an exclusive deal with countries such as Blumund or Dwargon. We only had to make such deals with countries we trusted.</p>
<p id="line_3978">We also had plenty of tricks up our sleeve, so there’s no need to panic. We could also just develop our country and raise our influence until countries willing to trust us stepped forward. This thought had solidified in my heart.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_3979">“Uh, I understand. Then allow me to be the bridge to connect your nation and the council.

<p id="line_3984">Since the whole ordeal has already concluded anyway, I didn’t want to say this to his face directly. But at this point, I suppose explaining things thoroughly to him would be a form of mercy.</p>

<p id="line_3988">“The merchants ignored our request and would only take dwarven gold coins.

<p id="line_3989">“Th-that’s…”</p>
<p id="line_3990">Well, this was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s plan.</p>
<p id="line_3991">He gathered a bunch of reporters for them to observe all of the details. This way our nation would be portrayed as the reasonable side while the merchants would appear as though they were all working towards some sort of a conspiracy.</p>
<p id="line_3992">I agreed with his method.</p>
<p id="line_3993">Since information was only useful when used correctly. As opposed to allowing people to fabricate stories about us, I’d hope that facts of the matter could be reported word for word from the start.</p>
<p id="line_3994">That being said, it was thanks to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Elmesia’s advice that we were able to come up with such a strategy.</p>

<p id="line_3999">The merchants all looked desperate.</p>
<p id="line_4000">In comparison, the reporters looked happier than I expected. Since they were not the victims here, instead, some of them were even writing down the details of the negotiation with much vigor. Some have even brought expensive magic items such as video recorders. Surely the story of this incident would quickly spread among the nations.</p>
<p id="line_4001">These merchants brought the reporters here as insurance, yet now they had become their doom.</p>

<div><img alt="" class="full" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/illustrations/image12.jpeg"/></div><p class="pagebreak" id="line_4005"></p>
<p id="line_4006">I thought I saw <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> giving off a wry smile. Well, it wasn’t really a physical one. And next, he switched to his elite look, unique to a merchant, and turned to Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, as well as glancing around the merchants.</p>
<p id="line_4007">Surely <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s prowess had also been observed at length by my executives.</p>
<p id="line_4008">People shouldn’t have any complaints now, even if I appointed <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> as the minister of finance.</p>

<p id="line_4011">Now we could finally say that everything had concluded.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>

<p id="line_4013">We would hold our routine conference to reflect on ourselves.</p>
<p id="line_4014">We were not going to the guest lobby, but the usual large conference room. We gathered there on the night following the end of the Tempest <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Founding Festival" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

There were also a few rare guests that had come upon receiving my invitation.</p>
<p id="line_4016">Since all of my executives had gathered as well, the room felt crowded.</p>
<p id="line_4017">I didn’t invite Milim and the other <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Demon Lord" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term].toLowerCase():}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s. If there were too many people, the conference could last for days. Especially considering the many incidents that occurred during the festival, there were tons of motions for us to go through.</p>
<p id="line_4018">My only concern was Veldora. He was moping in the corner of the room, and he was bound to interject at some point. Probably along the lines of “No challenger came to fight me,” etc. <em>Ah, what a bunch of useless complaints.</em></p>
<p id="line_4019"><em>It’s best that we don’t complicate things further. Let’s get the reflection conference going.</em></p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4020">“Eh—first off, I want to say this to everyone, thank you all for the hard work this time!”</p>
<p id="line_4021">I started by praising everyone and began the conference.</p>
<p id="line_4022">The first one to speak was, surprisingly, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4023">“I was genuinely shocked just now.

<p id="line_4024">The executives nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_4025">Most of them probably thought that I would conclude the matter after the payment. But upon seeing my serious treatment towards them, everyone, without exception, looked surprised.</p>
<p id="line_4026">“Right, I didn’t expect you to give such a severe punishment,” Rigurd agreed with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

What was your verdict, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>?”</p>
<p id="line_4028">Having been asked, I retold the whole story.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4029">“To have severed ties with them while mustering such resolve…” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said, rather dumbfounded, after hearing the story. But he wasn’t mad, quite the opposite, as he actually agreed with my method.</p>
<p id="line_4030">“Heh heh heh, I think you did the right thing. An eye for an eye. That being said, have you considered what to do afterwards?”</p>
<p id="line_4031"><em>I’ve really been outsmarted by Elmesia.</em></p>
<p id="line_4032">Her insight was to the point of being frightening. It seemed that she had seen right through me.</p>
<p id="line_4033">“What did she mean by that, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama?”</p>
<p id="line_4034">Since <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Benimaru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> asked, I had to express my view.</p>
<p id="line_4035">“It’s like what I said before, I’m not gonna play to the Council’s score. If possible, I wish to be on equal and friendly terms with them.”</p>
<p id="line_4036">“I understand that. That’s why, in my humble opinion, we need to make a certain level of compromise.”</p>
<p id="line_4037">I nodded to Rigurd and continued: “Listen well now! As Elmesia-san has said, that Duke <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Muze" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was just someone else’s lackey.

That’s why, next time it will be his boss taking the lead in person.”</p>
<p id="line_4038">“That is most likely the case.”</p>
<p id="line_4039">“—In other words, will we be able to negotiate with them once more?”</p>
<p id="line_4040">“That’s right. Since it was them that first failed in negotiating with us, when the opportunity arises, we can utilize our advantages in that regard to have better terms in negotiation!”</p>
<p id="line_4041">“I see…”</p>
<p id="line_4042">“In my opinion, they didn’t want to antagonize us directly. That’s why they wanted to put a collar on our neck by first befriending us. Now that they’ve failed, surely, they will have to consider us an opponent to be reckoned with. In that case—”</p>
<p id="line_4043">“Surely they will come across us again if they intend to launch economic warfare. Neither of us is prepared well enough to be able to do that. Therefore, both can form their own self-sustaining economic circle even without the opponent. That’s most likely the case.”</p>
<p id="line_4044"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> continued to further elaborate. For now, things had concluded with our negotiation. And it would seem that we had the upper hand in the long run.</p>
<p id="line_4045">“In that case, we don’t need to be restrained by the international charter set by the Western State Council, and will be able to take over different nations by ourselves. But this will not be a militaristic invasion, but rather an invasive act via economy.”</p>

But right now, doing that serves no purpose. We may give it a try if conflict breaks out, but it will, nonetheless, be a lot of hard work. We just need to build a friendly relationship. Honestly, I don’t want any more trouble to deal with.”</p>
<p id="line_4056">As I explained matters like that, everyone seemed to agree.</p>
<p id="line_4057">We just had to try our best at making our own nation better. To create a firm economic circle on this land—that was our priority.</p>
<p id="line_4058">“Indeed, there’s not really any other option than to negotiate with your opponent. But I’m actually pretty sympathetic towards them. They can’t really restrain you with economic sanctions nor through military suppression. It’ll really be hard for them to give any condition.”</p>
<p id="line_4059">Elmesia shed a crocodile tear for our opponent.</p>

<p id="line_4064">Naturally, I had my reasons.</p>

He revealed the whole ordeal without hesitation.</p>
<p id="line_4095">His words made Vesta look awkward while I looked troubled.</p>
<p id="line_4096">“—It’s just as I thought. Next time before you go public, could you at least give me a heads up and discuss it with me a bit,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, looking worn out, gave me this rather straight-forward bit of advice.</p>
<p id="line_4097">To us, the projector’s value was that it was a convenient and irreplaceable invention for entertainment. But to the eyes of the kings and nobles of the Western Nations, it was an entirely different case.</p>
<p id="line_4098">“This thing has way too many applications, to the point that they’re uncountable. At least to the crowd at the scene, everyone could tell its value,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said unpleasantly.</p>
<p id="line_4099"><em>I just thought that it would be great to have a large screen to watch the expanded footage of the martial tournament and the labyrinth interior. And the people loved it too…</em></p>
<p id="line_4100">But the device had given the officials of different nations quite a cultural shock, it seemed.</p>
<p id="line_4101">“With something like that, it would change the whole concept of war,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s friend Pann said, Dorf-san also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p id="line_4102">They said that an immediate application would be in the military. One huge advantage was that they could now command the army from a safe distance. The officials of the army no longer had to risk themselves in any dangerous situation. Instead they could send out scout troops to check on the enemy status and quickly gain feedback to apply to their own army.</p>
<p id="line_4103">As opposed to the one-to-one “Magic Communication,” this method would enable many times more volume of intelligence transfer. Everyone could share the same batch of information, and the accuracy of command would be greatly improved.</p>
<p id="line_4104">We published the technology at random, and it could already be called ultra-futuristic. It seemed to be a revolutionary technology.</p>
<p id="line_4105">I was only thinking “It’ll be good to have something like this” and ordered people to construct the device. Yet it turned out that we made something incredible.</p>
<p id="line_4106">I muttered unconsciously that “You should have told me this earlier,” but I was met with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s stare and scolding “That was my line!”</p>
<p id="line_4107"><em>I am reflecting now, but that’s not the point of this meeting. Not everything in this world will go according to our heart’s content.</em></p>
<p id="line_4108">“B-but, you must require a high level of magicule to operate the machine. If the mana of the user isn’t high enough, it won’t work. The distance and quantity of the intelligence transfer also depends on the user’s ability. It’s not that simple to apply it universally!”</p>
<p id="line_4109">I managed to cover my tail with this explanation. I had actually made improvements regarding these drawbacks by developing a system to store magicule. But it would be wise to save these words for later discussions with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> in private.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_4111">And when I thought it was over, it was Elmesia’s turn to cut in.</p>

<p id="line_4115">“That’s for sure!”</p>
<p id="line_4116">I didn’t even get the chance to respond before <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> cut in to add to the mess.

<p id="line_4120">“Seriously, dad’s always so dramatic.”</p>
<p id="line_4121">I had a feeling that when these two got mixed together, things may get dangerous. I suddenly felt bad for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and Elmesia also shared a surprisingly good chemistry. You can’t fake a friendship like that, they were really close to each other, going so far as to give high-fives. I couldn’t feel their difference in status at all.</p>
<p id="line_4122">Even the aristocrats of the Western Nations couldn’t approach her—to most, Emperor Elmesia Elaure <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was indeed such an elusive top figure. Yet the sight in front of my eyes was really hard to imagine. Even the members of the Emperor’s <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Imperial Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s standing behind Elmesia looked surprised at the scene.</p>
<p id="line_4123">“Members of the Magus! What you saw is the equivalent of a national secret, you must not leak this information!”</p>
<p id="line_4124">Although <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> came out to give closure, there’s no saying as to how effective it was.</p>
<p id="line_4125">Elmesia, on the other hand, paid no mind to what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elalude" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> or anyone else said, she was gonna speak her mind regardless.</p>
<p id="line_4126">“Given this to be the case, I hope that you will send researchers to our kingdom. Of course, it will be considered an official employment. We will be paying the proper fee for instructing tech research.”</p>
<p id="line_4127">“In other words, will you be in charge of finding the labor as well?”</p>
<p id="line_4128">“About that…I do want to do that. But if you are afraid of a possible leak of your core technology, we can also export the necessary instruments to address the issue.”</p>
<p id="line_4129">“Um um, in that way, there will be a need to transport components made in our nation.”</p>
<p id="line_4130">To respond to Elmesia’s request, many conditions had to be satisfied first. For instance, the plumbing required for facilities relying on water, such as a kitchen, bathroom, or toilet, were all the product of dwarven technology contributed by Kaijin and the other dwarves. I wasn’t sure whether technicians from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> could recreate them or not, but it would also take too much time for them to learn the technology from scratch.</p>
<p id="line_4131">With that being the case, it would be faster for us to export the domestically produced machine parts directly to <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>
<p id="line_4132">“Since you are sending the parts, I hope you will be using that thing called a train. I will be providing funds for that as well; can you finish developing it faster?” Elmesia said, seemingly having seen through my thoughts already.</p>

<p id="line_4150">Since our country was leading the charge, it was easy to standardize things. Laying down the tracks wouldn’t be throwing up any issues.</p>

<p id="line_4168">“Ah, that would do just fine. Please come and rest at our village when you do,” Momiji said with a smile all over her face.

<p id="line_4176">“It’s fine. We don’t have a problem with it, though I hope that you will run your investigation carefully.”</p>
<p id="line_4177">In other words, if the investigations showed that there was no issue, we could begin the tunnel drilling.</p>
<p id="line_4178">The attitude of the Tengu clan had softened on the matter. The project could finally proceed smoothly. How wonderful.</p>

<p class="space-break" id="line_4212">“Thank you for your response.

That’s why we plan to start a national business as the first step of a newly-rising nation. Based on these considerations—”</p>
<p id="line_4213">What should we do as business? That was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myuran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s question.</p>
<p id="line_4214">“S-surely you should operate just as we planned before, running agriculture—”</p>
<p id="line_4215">“It shouldn’t be an issue. Everything has been proceeding as planned, we’ve ordered people to handle specific crops.”</p>
<p id="line_4216">“I see, what about—”</p>
<p id="line_4217"><em>Huh—what about what?</em></p>
<p id="line_4218">I tried asking her about all the ideas I had, but it seemed that she had arranged everything in order. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had obviously tamed the noblemen, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also gained massive support among his people. In terms of the military might of different factions within the nation, a consensus had also been reached.</p>
<p id="line_4219">The old <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had fallen, and the new nation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had risen in its place. The first step was to end the unrest within the nation, which seemed to have been accomplished. In addition, they needed to comfort the citizens and gradually move the nation’s industrial focus to agriculture…</p>
<p id="line_4220"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Diablo" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> must have been behind the scenes to help, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myuran" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also seemed to have executed the long-term plan extraordinarily.</p>
<p id="line_4221">“Then could you gather those who are currently unemployed?”</p>
<p id="line_4222">“We shall obey <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama’s order. If possible, we were actually thinking about using our own manpower to lay down the railway tracks. Since it will become a method of transportation for our agricultural products, surely, the transportation network will be a major lifeline for our nation.”</p>
<p id="line_4223">“Hmm, it would indeed. If you are not just growing the amount for your own nation’s consumption, you are going to get a lot of surplus in the future. You will need to ship them to other nations in need, before they go bad. I think it will be an important industry for your nation.”</p>
<p id="line_4224">In the past, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmus" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom would resell goods from Dwargon, those were mostly handcrafts and gear, there was no concern over any items going bad. The merchants were responsible for transporting these items, and the country could easily profit via taxing tariffs.</p>
<p id="line_4225">This would no longer apply. The merchants would no longer be the sole responsible party for the goods, the nation itself would be forced to raise its own credibility. In store for them was the era of nations ensuring the legality of the flow of goods.</p>
<p id="line_4226">“I look forward to the day when the ‘Magic Train’ runs through the great plains. Surely the merchants in the future will change their trade model as well. We will need to continue to learn in order to catch up with the trend.”</p>
<p id="line_4227">“It will be faster than horse carriages. Goods that are expected to be delivered in a week, it will only take three hours in the future. The storage space required will probably be a hundred times more than before.”</p>

The news was probably too shocking, making everyone go numb. As for <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, they gave off a slightly different dry smile respectively.</p>
<p id="line_4230">“Anyhow, we need to purchase the land for laying tracks early, I want to plan out a straight and effective transportation route. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Geld" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s men, as well as the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="beastmen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> studying at our town, have already learnt how to survey land.

<p id="line_4231">“Understood.

<p id="line_4232">Apparently, they were planning to offer us aid in the first place, the matter had been resolved smoothly.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4233">Then it was Fuze’s turn to raise his hand.</p>
<p id="line_4234">“Because of all the important figures gathered here, I waited until now to say anything,” he ended his sentence with a wry smile.</p>
<p id="line_4235">Fuze was there since the pre-festival night. But he was timid, seeing all of the people gathered around, and didn’t come up to talk to me.</p>
<p id="line_4236">I noticed that as well, but I couldn’t find the appropriate time to talk with him. Although he seemed to have enjoyed himself during the festival, I planned to greet him later and just forgot about it.</p>
<p id="line_4237">“Ah, sorry. I was going to greet you back then.”</p>
<p id="line_4238">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama seemed busy then as well, it’s alright. By the way, my friend wanted to talk to you too, this is great timing. What he has to say relates to what has just been discussed.”</p>
<p id="line_4239">Fuze then introduced me to Baron Veryard, who I also knew well. I recalled him to be an experienced man who should not be underestimated.</p>
<p id="line_4240">“I am Veryard. I kind of forced my way to the meeting today. First of all, I want to thank Your Majesty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And to everyone here, it is a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p id="line_4241">He stood with great gesture and bowed elegantly. He clearly knew how to deliver a good greeting, nothing like some lowly noble from a small kingdom.</p>
<p id="line_4242">“Then, allow me to ask a question in the stead of the ruler of Blumund Kingdom, King Dolam.”</p>
<p id="line_4243">Veryard suddenly squinted his eyes at the seats next to him.</p>
<p id="line_4244">The aforementioned royal couple were sitting there. <em>So, you guys actually came? I’m really not sure, considering how little presence you’ve shown throughout the meeting.</em></p>
<p id="line_4245">I told King Dolam that we would have a proper conference planned after this meeting, now it would be unnecessary. This was the equivalent of the later conference.</p>
<p id="line_4246">Although Dolam was smiling like a nice guy, I couldn’t help but ask, “Is this really okay.” <em>Let’s put that aside for now</em>, Veryard began to speak.</p>
<p id="line_4247">“As Fuze has mentioned, what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama has said is highly relevant to the future development of Blumund. King Dolam also predicted that our nation will become an important hub for the flow of goods. I’ve also had my theory before finally understanding after hearing your speech. In other words, your Majesty wishes to make our country a gathering point of all exports, is that right? Your Majesty mentioned that once this ‘Magic Train’ appears, the concept of logistics would change forever. If you are making our nation into a hub of sorts, surely goods from all over the continent would come through. In that case, we will need people managing these goods. In addition, if your Majesty wishes us to investigate what each nation is lacking in supply, that should also be properly arranged. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama, is this the role that you wish our nation to play?”</p>
<p id="line_4248">As expected from Veryard, being nothing like Fuze, he was quick on his feet.</p>
<p id="line_4249">He had spelt out everything in my head.</p>
<p id="line_4250">“That’s the role indeed, will you be willing to do it? While it goes without saying, you can also just provide us with the venue to operate. I shall promise to pay up the fee for using the land with the amount of tariff we earned each year.”</p>
<p id="line_4251">“Surely you jest. You shouldn’t underestimate our people as folks who are satisfied with a lazy life of making profits from margins, and exclude us from the system. We will be training our people from now on, so as to prepare for the future!”</p>
<p id="line_4252"><em>Oh snap. Just how far ahead is this guy planning?</em></p>
<p id="line_4253">I at least had the very competent <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Raphael" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sensei with me, but how could this guy catch up with me, using just a human brain? This was beyond being a visionary, this man was very intelligent.</p>
<p id="line_4254">Surely Blumund Kingdom would have dramatic change that completely altered their past values. That was not just limited to Blumund, but surely there would be some major reformations.</p>
<p id="line_4255">Veryard had seen that clearly from the start, and so he had announced that they were already preparing for it. This man was something else. No wonder he managed to get his way with me. I was right to not underestimate this type of person.</p>
<p id="line_4256"><em>It’s a relief that he’s not an enemy, seriously.</em></p>
<p id="line_4257">“Then there is a favor that I must ask. I’ll need to trouble you guys with investigating the export items to each nation and build a system that delivers what is needed to where they are needed. Since your kingdom has a good intelligence network, won’t you be great at the job?”</p>
<p id="line_4258">“Aha, I see <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama is not one to be underestimated. Very well, I shall reflect in detail regarding the matter when I return.”</p>
<p id="line_4259"><em>You can say that about yourself</em>, I thought to myself as I nodded.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4260">I was only planning to open a reflection meeting about the festival, yet it turned out to be something so troublesome that it had worn me out. But it had a lot of value nonetheless, since our negotiation with Blumund was successful. I thought it would take a lot more time to finish this difficult negotiation. Thankfully, Baron Veryard was there.</p>
<p id="line_4261"><em>I’m unsure as to whether that was a blessing or a curse, but since we’ve reached this point, let’s just ask them nicely for cooperation.</em></p>
<p id="line_4262">Upon thinking so, I began to worry over what to ask of Veryard.</p>
<div class="scenebreak"><img alt="Hard scene break." class="ornament-hard" src="/ln/sources/Volume 9/figures/hardscenebreak.png"/></div>
<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4263">Alright, now that we had finished talking about the difficult topics about running the nation, it was time to proceed with the reflection meeting.</p>
<p id="line_4264">I switched up my mood and wanted to hear what everyone had to say.</p>
<p id="line_4265">“Next—does anyone else have any opinion—?”</p>
<p id="line_4266">Hearing my words, someone stood up anxiously.</p>
<p id="line_4267"><em>It’s Veldora.</em></p>
<p id="line_4268"><em>I’ve got a bad feeling about this, so I’m just gonna pretend that I didn’t see…</em></p>
<p id="line_4269">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, what the hell was that?”</p>
<p id="line_4270"><em>How am I supposed to answer that?</em></p>
<p id="line_4271">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p id="line_4272">“The labyrinth! Of course. I was looking forward to it, and in the end, no one managed to get to the 100<sup>th</sup> floor!”</p>
<p id="line_4273"><em>Didn’t I just give him a good scolding? Was he not reflecting at all?</em></p>
<p id="line_4274">He really just ignored everything I said.</p>
<p id="line_4275">And I wasted my time practicing what to speak—Veldora kept on complaining, which really made me want to reply with a “so what.” But I held back. If I were to say something like that, he’d definitely lose control.</p>
<p id="line_4276">“Well, personally I’m not that satisfied with that part either.”</p>
<p id="line_4277">“Right? You are still so reliable as usual. How do you plan to adjust things going forward?”</p>
<p id="line_4278">It wasn’t as if I would get an immediate result upon making adjustments. At least not until we had adventurers who had the abilities to reach there.</p>
<p id="line_4279">“In any case, based on what happened, there’s no way we can proceed with this. Those adventurers were mostly either average or somewhat experienced. They are already pretty good challengers—”</p>
<p id="line_4280">“Pretty good…”</p>
<p id="line_4281">“That sounded pretty rude…”</p>
<p id="line_4282">“But I don’t feel like we can deny it either…”</p>
<p id="line_4283">The Cabal trio seemed down, <em>but you guys spent all your time treasure-hunting, so I can be a little salty</em>.</p>
<p id="line_4284">“Don’t be discouraged. All I did was walk the entire time. And for some reason we ended up at level ten. By the time I realized, my companions had already killed the Level Boss…”</p>
<p id="line_4285"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Masayuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was probably trying to comfort them, but no matter how you saw it, he sounded like he was ridiculing them. But <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Elen" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem that discouraged by it. Perhaps, to the trio, it didn’t sound as bad. They looked surprisingly calm, so it was probably okay to leave them alone.</p>
<p id="line_4286">“—In other words, you should think that it is still not your time to shine yet!”</p>
<p id="line_4287">As for Veldora, there’d probably never be a chance for him to shine.</p>
<p id="line_4288">“WHAT! Then were Milim, Ramiris and my efforts in vain?!”</p>
<p id="line_4289"><em>Please count me in as well.</em> While I thought this to myself, it’d be best not to quarrel with him for too long.</p>
<p id="line_4290">“Don’t worry. The labyrinth demonstration had a very good promotional effect on the different nations.”</p>
<p id="line_4291">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_4292">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles-kun" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, please come and explain!”</p>
<p id="line_4293">As I ordered, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> stood up.</p>
<p id="line_4294">He then began to explain very confidently to Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_4295">“Due to the public display of the interior footage of the labyrinth, all of the nations were very intrigued. The fact that a random treasure chest had the chance to give rare-grade items also added on to the promotional effect.”</p>
<p id="line_4296">“And it’s all thanks to me…”</p>
<p id="line_4297"><em>Um—I suppose you can put it that way… I guess?</em></p>
<p id="line_4298">“All the noblemen from the nations would definitely want to send their adventurers there!” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> concluded his explanation.</p>
<p id="line_4299">It seemed that many noblemen hired adventurers or powerful mercenaries as guards. In other words, once these people caught wind of a labyrinth with piles of treasure, they would probably send a large group of adventurers to strike it rich.</p>
<p id="line_4300"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> also mentioned that the noblemen may sponsor challengers in order to obtain the treasure. In addition, unemployed adventurers may want to get involved for the money. They may try to challenge the labyrinth repeatedly.</p>
<p id="line_4301">They could probably tell from the experience of that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kai" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> guy, that it was very difficult to obtain rare-grade gear.</p>
<p id="line_4302">I wasn’t gonna reveal anything here, but <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is in fact planning something even shadier. It was something like a lottery, he had decided to spark people’s desire to draw lottery tickets. He was gonna intentionally let people see others getting expensive items from the lottery in order to create a competitive spirit. His plan was to make the adventurers and the nobles be our captives (money trap).</p>
<p id="line_4303">Moreover, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had other things planned out as well.</p>
<p id="line_4304">“In addition, I also want to establish a prize system. We will tell everyone that once they reach level 100—in other words, when they actually conquer the labyrinth—they can receive a huge prize. Naturally, many nobles would want to sponsor adventurers and other challengers and send them down there,” <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> said with a smirk.</p>
<p id="line_4305"><em>As long as we make the impression that the labyrinth is a place that will generate enormous profit, even the scrooge of noblemen will fall for it. They will probably hire the best of the adventurers, sponsoring them with gear to have a better shot at challenging the labyrinth.</em></p>
<p id="line_4306">These noblemen were the so-called benefactors. If their adventurers performed valiantly, the nobles themselves got to share the glory. Moreover, this had tremendous potential for profitability. In other words, this was enough to motivate the nobles.</p>
<p id="line_4307">Moreover, while the noblemen sponsors stayed in our nation, they would also enjoy all the entertainment.</p>
<p id="line_4308">It also seemed like a good idea to use the live footage of the labyrinth walkthrough as an attraction. We would also be opening a variety of other projects as ways to attract more consumers.</p>
<p id="line_4309">Speaking of sponsors—I was even more impressed by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> upon hearing his proposal. He was already a bad boy in my book, but I didn’t expect him to take it that far.</p>
<p id="line_4310"><em>Indeed, surely the sponsors will be happy as well if their challengers acted violently.</em></p>

<p id="line_4317">“As I have just mentioned, our nation will be providing prizes for the labyrinth walkthroughs.

<p id="line_4318">“Why?”</p>
<p id="line_4319">“The biggest reason is for the promotional effect. Your association has divisions set up in different nations. It will be the fastest and most effective way to promote.”</p>
<p id="line_4320">“I see, that makes sense. But what other reason do you have?”</p>
<p id="line_4321">“Yes. In order to manage the challengers, I would like to utilize the identity cards of the adventurers.”</p>
<p id="line_4322">“I see now. Seriously though, that’s some idea you’ve come up with…”</p>
<p id="line_4323">I’m not sure if <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was impressed or shocked, he fell into his own thoughts as he sighed.</p>
<p id="line_4324">Our nation could also issue the permits to enter the labyrinth, but that would take a lot of extra work.

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4340">I spoke to Veldora.</p>
<p id="line_4341">“Have you heard, the proposal has been accepted. There’s gonna be more adventurers coming in the future.”</p>
<p id="line_4342">“Um, um.”</p>
<p id="line_4343">“Within the first year or so, it may still pose a huge challenge. But after two, three years, I think there will be more capable people.”</p>
<p id="line_4344">“Ho? Do you have any proof for that?”</p>
<p id="line_4345">“Well, the reason is simple. There is a very low chance of dying in the labyrinth, so you can practice your skills in it. There’s no reason why you wouldn’t become stronger throughout the process.”</p>
<p id="line_4346">“I see. As expected from <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, now I’ve got to look forward to it!”</p>
<p id="line_4347">To someone with longevity such as Veldora, two or three years would pass by in the blink of an eye. That’s why his face was plastered with a smile as he commented about his expectations.</p>
<p id="line_4348"><em>Right, right, it’s great now that I’ve managed to convince him.</em></p>
<p id="line_4349">While I was laughing internally, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> suddenly raised her hand to speak.</p>
<p id="line_4350">“Can I interrupt for a second?”</p>
<p id="line_4351">“What is it?”</p>
<p id="line_4352">Although I didn’t think she objected to the matter until now, my nerves were still kind of tense. <em>I suppose I’m once bitten, twice shy.</em></p>
<p id="line_4353">“I have a request, or rather, a proposal.”</p>
<p id="line_4354">Her tone was giving me a bad feeling.</p>

<p id="line_4356">“…I’m listening…”</p>
<p id="line_4357">“Thanks, then allow me—”</p>
<p id="line_4358">What <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> brought up was “Crisis awareness may be reduced as a result of labyrinth activity.”</p>
<p id="line_4359">If they become accustomed to not dying in the labyrinth, it may cause them to become careless outside. That was <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s fear. I was worried about that too, but I felt that the adventurers should see to that themselves. I was a bit short on words while <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> pointed it out.</p>

<p id="line_4361">“Don’t think that you can just hand wave this away, this is a matter of life and death.”</p>
<p id="line_4362">“Ayy, let’s not put it that way.”</p>
<p id="line_4363">“No.”</p>
<p id="line_4364">“Come on, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-san?”</p>
<p id="line_4365">I begged <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_4366">“—But, if you are willing to accept my proposal, I may just approve your plan.”</p>
<p id="line_4367">“What proposal would that be, please indulge me?”</p>
<p id="line_4368"><em>Making <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> angry will make me die pretty horribly.

<p id="line_4369">“Hehehe, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rimuru" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>—it’s nothing really. You don’t have to be that nervous, this proposal would benefit us both.”</p>
<p id="line_4370">“Eh?”</p>
<p id="line_4371">“The labyrinth poses a pretty good challenge. Not only can one train their ability down there, we can also practice effective fighting strategies against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monsters" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. However, I’m worried that people may put their guards down against death. That’s why I want to dispatch the Priests of the Western Saints Church there.”</p>
<p id="line_4372">“The Priests! No way, are you serious, commander <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>-sama?”</p>
<p id="line_4373">It was Fuze who suddenly interrupted.</p>
<p id="line_4374">Many at the scene were shocked, and upon inquiring about it, I learnt that Priests were very capable users of holy magic.</p>
<p id="line_4375"><em>Now that you’ve said so, I believe I’ve heard similar rumors.</em></p>
<p id="line_4376">There was a group of people whose ranks were above the average ministers and have learnt the secret “Holy Magic” of the Western Saints Church. And Bishops, as well as higher ranked personnel, could even perform “God’s Miracle,” a spell strong enough to restore damaged body parts.</p>
<p id="line_4377">“Yes, I’m serious. It was indeed a secret technique, but with how things are progressing, they won’t grow in the future. Even though these people may have the talents of geniuses, none of them are able to cast God’s Miracle “Resurrection.” If this is to continue, the knowledge passed down from ancient times will be buried. It may be a different case when it comes to wartime, but such a technique is difficult to pass on during peaceful time.”</p>
<p id="line_4378"><em>In summary, are their resurrection skills rusting because they don’t have people to revive?</em></p>
<p id="line_4379">While I felt that something was off, I understood what <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> meant. She wanted to use our dungeon in order to train their “Holy Magic.”</p>
<p id="line_4380">This was also pretty beneficial from our perspective.</p>
<p id="line_4381">Even though not everyone could practice God’s Miracle of “Resurrection,” if people capable of using revival magic in general increased, combat outside the labyrinth would be safer as well. In addition, it was also helpful for me to quickly fully understand the “Ultimate Secret of faith and grace” of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminism" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> via actual information of their practices.</p>
<p id="line_4382"><em>I don’t oppose the idea.</em></p>
<p id="line_4383">“Same here, we would be troubling you as well.”</p>
<p id="line_4384">“Hehe, I knew you would say that.”</p>
<p id="line_4385">Disregarding the shocked crowd, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and I agreed to each other’s proposals. Now the matter of dispatching Priests into the labyrinth was also settled.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4386">Just as I thought that the matter was finished, <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> raised another proposal.</p>
<p id="line_4387">“By the way, there’s something else. I want the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s to challenge the labyrinth as well as part of their training.”</p>
<p id="line_4388">“Huh?”</p>
<p id="line_4389">“Veldora-san over there—eh, weren’t you selling takoyaki out there?”</p>
<p id="line_4390">“T-that’s irrelevant to the topic, right? Let’s get down to business already!”</p>
<p id="line_4391">“R-right, I definitely did not sell takoyaki under an ‘alias’!”</p>
<p id="line_4392">“…Oh, and I almost managed to convince myself otherwise… It was you after all.

<p id="line_4393">It was impossible to deceive <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. Honestly, to anyone who had heard of Veldora in the past, there was no way you could fool them either.</p>
<p id="line_4394">Because Veldora was insistent on opening up a teppanyaki shop, I asked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Myourmiles" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to help him prepare shop staff. Veldora later came up with some ideas and requested <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> to prepare some iron griddles. It was the specialized iron griddle that is commonly seen in Osaka, Japan for takoyaki.</p>
<p id="line_4395">The condition for Veldora to open shop was to not expose his own identity. With that being said, the residents of the town already knew who he was. That’s why I told him to at least hide his identity from the staff, and use an <em>alias</em>… And Veldora actually decided to use the name “Alias.”</p>
<p id="line_4396">Allegedly, the shop called “Alias Takoyaki” had quite the popular sale.</p>
<p id="line_4397"><em>But that’s really irrelevant to our topic right now.</em></p>
<p id="line_4398">“Please forget about that first, I want to discuss in detail about the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>s’ training.”</p>
<p id="line_4399">I managed to force the topic back on track. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> didn’t seem to mind, so we continued as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p id="line_4400">“In my opinion, those who have just been enlisted as a <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Holy Knight" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> wouldn’t be able to win against <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gozer" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. That’s why I want to split them into groups of five to six people to challenge the labyrinth. On one hand they can practice combat, on the other hand, we can also train the Priests we mentioned.

<p id="line_4401">“Ho? I’m fine with that. In fact, that’s just down my alley!”</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4423">Given the state of the matters, everyone seemed to have spoken.</p>
<p id="line_4424">There was one more thing that I hoped to confirm with the opportunity. Or rather, it was the reason why I gathered all my connections.</p>
<p id="line_4425">“There is one thing I hope to ask—”</p>
<p id="line_4426">With that said, I began to ask about the eastern merchants.</p>
<p id="line_4427">I was guessing those people had been busy scheming behind everyone’s back, mentioning this matter was also a reminder to everyone.</p>
<p id="line_4428">“Dwargon welcomes and accepts all, so with everyone coming and going, the eastern merchants probably also passed by. However—”</p>
<p id="line_4429">“To answer your doubts, King <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Gazel" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.

<p id="line_4430">While near the border of Armored Nation Dwargon, anyone would be under the surveillance of the spymaster <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Anrietta" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. To try to sabotage things would be the equivalent of committing suicide. So, the eastern merchants would probably behave there.</p>
<p id="line_4431">“Unfortunately, our nation was too weak as a trading partner. Moreover, the only advantage our nation had was the espionage department. Even though we do have a record of the flows of relevant goods, we don’t often see any eastern merchants.”</p>
<p id="line_4432">“Oi oi oi, your king is present right here, how can you say something like that…”</p>
<p id="line_4433">It seemed that not many people traveled to the Blumund Kingdom. And since the nation itself was capable of surveilling these people, we didn’t need to be worried about them.</p>
<p id="line_4434">“Is our nation fine in that regard?”</p>
<p id="line_4435">“Of course. All the foreign imports are overseen together, the thirteen royal families were not given authority over them.”</p>
<p id="line_4436">Basically, Sorcerer’s Dynasty <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sarion" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was almost in a lock-down state. There wasn’t much communication with other nations, so the eastern merchants wouldn’t be able to sneak in there. Moreover, there were few people that could manage to fool the eyes of Elmesia, so I didn’t think it would be an issue.</p>
<p id="line_4437">The only nation that concerned me was the newly established nation of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Farmenas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> run by <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Youm" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p id="line_4442">He had a point. Not all eastern merchants were schemers, surely there were people who just wanted to do business normally. You couldn’t order the association to just suddenly pause trade with these people. The members of the association needed to make a living as well.</p>

<p id="line_4485">That left us with <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Yuuki" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>.</p>

<p id="line_4490">I didn’t tell anyone unfamiliar to the whole ordeal about my special relationship with Shizu-san.

<p id="line_4552">The pawns at his disposal were drastically reduced. <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Granbell" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> had suffered great losses prior to the festival.

<p id="line_4564">The deadline this time is quite early, so it’s a relief that I caught up just in time.</p>
<p id="line_4565">Then, as for volume 9, it’s part 2 and the finale of the previous volume of “Founding of <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="monster" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], false):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> Kingdom Arc.”</p>
<p id="line_4566">Ahem, actually.</p>
<p id="line_4567">Although I only had the idea after finishing writing, it is an absolutely impossible mission to write both volume 8 and 9 into one book. The reduction of pages in the last volume put it back on the right (regular) track, but the situation is reversed again.</p>
<p id="line_4568">Yep, reversed to the old time.</p>
<p id="line_4569">It’s like suddenly getting back to start after a bit slack after taking much effort to successfully lose weight. My weight didn’t spare me any mercy, possibly due to me not having time to exercise during the writing. I’ve regained around seven kilograms. I need to avoid repeating the same mistake next time and don’t rush that much during writing.</p>
<p id="line_4570">First of all, the most important thing is to write the outline of the story. Outline was a bit too vague, so let me get more specific. I’ll write down the characters that will appear alongside the events! That’s the minimum that I’ll start with. Regardless of the sequence of events, how I interject all the events was a very important thing that I took note of when writing.</p>
<p id="line_4571">As for why I’m saying this now. It’s because when I finished writing the whole thing and realized “AH, I forgot to insert this event into the story!” or “Eh, that character didn’t make it in…” etc. I made plenty of major missteps.</p>
<p id="line_4572">But seriously, there were too many characters in this volume.</p>
<p id="line_4573">I’ll reflect a bit on myself, but still, I got to say—</p>
<p id="line_4574">You can’t blame me for messing up a bit. Because this is a festival volume, it’s not easy trying to cut any character. By the way, this reminded me of early on in writing the light novel—around the time of writing volume 2?—I remember talking to Editor I-san.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4575">“You shouldn’t put so many characters at the start of a volume.”</p>
<p id="line_4576">“Eh, why though?”</p>
<p id="line_4577">“Well, if the readers can’t remember who is who, they won’t be able to tell about that either later on. And in the end, they will get distracted by the names and not focus on the story.”</p>
<p id="line_4578">“I see…”</p>
<p id="line_4579">“There are also other reasons, like you’ll have a hard time setting up characters.”</p>
<p id="line_4580">“Should I cut some people then? <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> doesn’t really get a lot of screen time, how about I make <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hakurou" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> a sword smith as well?”</p>
<p id="line_4581">“No, you should keep it as it is. The charm of the characters in ‘Tensura’ is very important. I think it will cause a problem if you cut characters randomly like that!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4582">That’s how I recall. My memory is not as good as before, maybe I’ve imagined some of the dialogue, but that’s the gist of it.</p>
<p id="line_4583">I had like an enlightenment after the conversation and felt that “Thank god I didn’t cut the character.”</p>
<p id="line_4584"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Kurobee" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is still around now, all because I-san was in charge of the book.</p>
<p id="line_4585">I basically used this as my excuse to no longer limit the amount of new characters coming in.</p>
<p id="line_4586">And then, when I was writing the seventh volume—</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4587">“Umm, can I talk to you about something…”</p>
<p id="line_4588">“Yeah, what is it?”</p>
<p id="line_4589">“<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s subordinates have increased in number, is that really okay?”</p>
<p id="line_4590">“…How many people will there be now?”</p>
<p id="line_4591">“Not a lot, I plan to have six captains with another three in addition.”</p>
<p id="line_4592">“That seemed a bit too many—”</p>
<p id="line_4593">“No no no, hold on, it’s because <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Hinata" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> is gonna lead two different organizations. So, shouldn’t we have more characters that actually have names?”</p>
<p id="line_4594">“Now that you’ve put it that way…”</p>
<p id="line_4595">“Also, in order to strengthen <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>’s faction, I’m thinking about adding some new major characters!”</p>
<p id="line_4596">“I see! I understand now. In that case, please write in that direction!”</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4597">And so, I could already tell that I-san really liked <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>. And after my persisted persuasion, Arno and the boys, as well as “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Three Martial Sages" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” were set to show up in the volume.</p>
<p id="line_4598">And after volume 8 we came to volume 9. The previously added characters alongside new characters have surely caused a situation of too many characters in one volume.</p>
<p id="line_4599">It must be pretty chaotic.</p>
<p id="line_4600">Had I confirmed by writing down all the names from the start, there’s no way I’d make a mistake like that.</p>
<p id="line_4601">I’ll learn step by step and use these past experiences well in the future.</p>
<p id="line_4602">Anyhow, I thought of this when doing some final confirmation with the volume. But—</p>
<p id="line_4603">Eh, did I not mention that the “<span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Three Martial Sages" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>” wasn’t gonna be in this volume?</p>
<p id="line_4604">In that case, except for Glenda-san who betrayed her comrades to cooperate with the <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Rosso" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span>, what were <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Sare" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> and <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Grigori" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> up to now?</p>
<p id="line_4605">The chance of these two appearing in volume 9—ZERO.</p>

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4608">Let’s change the topic next.</p>
<p id="line_4609">There is a major writing mistake that I wish to inform everyone. It’s about the pronoun that <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> uses to refer to herself. She always uses “Wa-Ra-Wa (妾, わらわ),” which to me was a pronoun used by arrogant females. But in reality, this seems to be a humbling pronoun instead.</p>
<p id="line_4610">I’ll admit that I was mistaken.</p>
<p id="line_4611">When <span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> was first introduced in the light novel, I had already known the correct usage of the pronoun at this point, but it was strange to suddenly change her tone. Based on these considerations, I decided to continue its usage.</p>
<p class="space-break" id="line_4612">When I was publishing the web novel, I already got a lot of criticism for misuse of “役不足 (Yakubusoku)” (Does not have sufficient power/authority to do something)<span class="icon color-primary color-in indent" data-hover-text="I think this is referring to the confusion of “役不足” and “力不足,” the former refers to the inability to do something due to lacking in authority (specifically referring to not having a high enough role/power to perform a task), the latter refers to the lack of personal ability in performing a task." onclick="this.app.showFootnote(this, this.getAttribute('data-hover-text'), event)"> <span class="footnote clickable indent"></span></span>, but to be honest, I still want to directly use the phrase in the light novel.</p>
<p id="line_4613">Even though there may be misuse, I just have to clarify with the readers. But, if I continue to use wrong phrases, it may cause the accurate message in my book to not be correctly understood by future readers. An author shouldn’t be limited in the way he chooses to express himself—that’s my two-cents, but then again, it’s important to use the correct grammar and phrase in writing.</p>
<p id="line_4614">If I encourage misuse, it will cause a lot of problems. That’s just how I think about it. That’s why I’m clarifying here, even though the tone of a character is not going to be revised in the future.</p>
<p id="line_4615"><span class="clickable {:this.app.getSupportingClasses(this):}|{otherConfigs.underlineChooseable}|" data-term="Luminas" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> does not have any intention of kneeling to anyone!

<p class="space-break no-indent" id="line_4617">And so, the afterword is about to finish.</p>
<p id="line_4618">I-san also very casually demanded me to “Please write six pages of afterword!” …When I handed in the initial draft, there were a lot of words. With the help of others, I added more to the character description before adding the afterword.</p>
<p id="line_4619">I-san seems to be less and less repulsed by thicker volumes.</p>
<p id="line_4620">It’s better than him telling me to cut stuff, so I don’t have an issue with that—just kidding, I have no clue what will happen in the next volume and I’m actually kind of nervous. After all, the story was planned to go through some key plots…</p>
<p id="line_4621">I’ve prepared a lot of events, and as to how to write the story in the future, even I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p id="line_4622">First off, I’m gonna finish the dungeon that I didn’t manage to finish this time—with this thought in mind, I plan to focus on outlining things clearly.</p>
