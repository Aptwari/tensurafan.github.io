Even then, not being punished at all would be unacceptable. I didn’t want to cause further problems, but this depended on how the King of Blumund would handle it. And the King, who seemed to have understood that well enough, replied in a voice that abandoned all mercy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_465"><span class="indent"><span>“Kazak is a Viscount. That man has done things tantamount to abandonment of his duties as a nobleman, such as helping local criminal organizations, to say the least. We cannot allow such a person to be a noble of Blumund.

In truth, we concluded this case with the ruination of his entire family.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_466"><span class="indent"><span>If that was the case, then we had no problems with it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_467"><span class="indent"><span>This might seem like a draconian punishment, but slave trade is an international criminal act.

As someone who had lived their whole life as a nobleman, it would be hard for Kazak to adapt his lifestyle. After losing his title and wealth, and being exiled from the country he lived in, it would probably be difficult enough for him to barely live through it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_469"><span class="indent"><span>However, as long as he was alive, he could turn over a new leaf.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_470"><span class="indent"><span>I had no further opinion on the matter because I deemed it a punishment befitting of his crimes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_471"><span class="indent"><span>“I understand, I shall see it as a punishment fit for him.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_472"><span class="indent"><span>“It’s a relief to hear those words.

Then I’ll be in your care from now on.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_474"><span class="indent"><span>The King of Blumund and I held our hands tightly and shook.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_475"><span class="indent"><span>And with this, the case came to a close.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_476"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_477"><span class="indent"><span>After that, we went on to the main topic.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_478"><span class="indent"><span>The King of Blumund put on a pleasant smile and asked, cutting to the chase, “By the way, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-dono, I heard back from Fuze.

I have heard a brief explanation from Fuze, but this could put our country in an awkward position.

So that’s it.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_486"><span class="indent"><span>“Sire, I believe we must carry out this plan regardless of its difficulties.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_487"><span class="indent"><span>I only explained things loosely but the look in the King’s eyes had changed; they revealed his true nature full of burning ambitions. And even the Queen, who had been holding back from saying anything, couldn’t hide her excitement. It seemed like the Queen could keep up quite well too. It looked like they were able to calculate just how much profit they stood to gain from merely hearing my story.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_488"><span class="italic indent"><span>Maybe there are more people to watch out for than just the King of Blumund.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_489"><span class="indent"><span>The King of Blumund with a gambler’s instinct, able to make rational snap decisions, and the composed and calculative queen. It’s because these two combined their strength that Blumund was able to maintain its influence despite being a small country.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_490"><span class="indent"><span>“We would have to discuss that after we conclude the </span><span data-term="Founding Festival" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, without issues, in three days.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_491"><span class="indent"><span>“If that’s so then I don’t think we need to worry.

However, Gazel didn’t flinch in the slightest and accepted the stare.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_514"><span class="indent"><span>“The elders spontaneously requested to come along, increasing the number of carriages dramatically. This is all your fault, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>!” Gazel said.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_515"><span class="indent"><span>If they were to use the pegasi they could arrive within a day from Dwargon. But since this was a formal visit, they couldn’t use the pegasus knights.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_516"><span class="indent"><span>This wasn’t just for the escorts. There was a need for a large and powerful country like Dwargon to show its majesty to the nobles of other countries that would be visiting the festival. And for that reason, not only did they prepare multiple outfits to change into, but they also had to bring aides to manage all the clothes and servants to help change into them. Because there was a need to bring them all they had to plan a large-scale visit.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_517"><span class="indent"><span>“To act like a king, there needs to be a preparation to its scale. It was a relief that at least the roads were properly maintained but the last few days still made for a very tiring trip.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_518"><span class="indent"><span>So that’s why Gazel often snuck away to visit here with a small number of people.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_519"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_520"><span class="indent"><span>Speaking of which, I received a report from </span><span data-term="Souei" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> that the road to Blumund had been jam-packed. It was so crowded that they needed traffic enforcement and all the inns were full.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_521"><span class="indent"><span>This was a report gleefully calling for a larger scale of transportation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_522"><span class="indent"><span>Modern Japan didn’t have problems with cars breaking down often. And even when it happened, there would be insurance agencies that would respond. However, it was always a big problem when carriages broke down in this world. Just clearing the carriage off of the road to not obstruct traffic took a lot of effort.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_523"><span class="indent"><span>You also had to take care of the horse’s condition, meaning you couldn’t use it however you wish.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_524"><span class="indent"><span>We had constructed the roads with extra width in preparation, but as expected, problems still arose.

And with </span><span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s support, it was said that Kagali-san had made a breakthrough achievement this time. That was the surprising discovery of the ancient ruins called “Soma”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_726"><span class="indent"><span>With this outstanding feat under her belt, Kagali-san’s reputation was revised in the public eye. Even those who were convinced that she had been afforded a high position solely through her personal connections with </span><span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> now acknowledged and revered her as the deputy grandmaster.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_727"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_728"><span class="indent"><span>“We discovered the ruins, but we still have a lot left to explore. We were only able to make a full map of the top floor; many of its riddles remain yet to be solved.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_729"><span class="indent"><span>“But that’s the job of the exploration adventurers. If they have Kagali’s map, even they could explore without problems.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_730"><span class="indent"><span>Instead of leaving it all to one accomplished exploration adventurer, it seemed like they were mobilizing people to start excavating. Since it would also help nurture young rookies, I think it would be killing two birds with one stone.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_731"><span class="indent"><span>And so Kagali-san took up the job of training exploration adventurers of at least rank B at the </span><span data-term="Ingracia" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Freedom Association" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> headquarters.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_732"><span class="indent"><span>The pay was quite high, and apparently, some of the income earned from selling the things found in the ancient ruins went straight into her pockets. Considering that the transactions were all made through the guild, the profits they reaped couldn’t be underestimated.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_733"><span class="indent"><span>“I see. Ruins seem to be quite profitable.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_734"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s right. Although in my case I’m not in it for the money, it’s more of a hobby. Although, occasionally, I put the things I found up for auction to top off the activity funds.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_735"><span class="indent"><span>As expected, exploring ruins was expensive, she seemed to have had a hard time.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_736"><span class="italic indent"><span>Yes, yes, talking about ruins…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_737"><span class="indent"><span>“I have something I want to ask, who owns the ruins? Does the country they are in manage it?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_738"><span class="indent"><span>“Uh-um, that’s a bit complicated. Take, for instance, the topic of our conversation, the ancient ruins of ‘Soma’; they are under the administration of the </span><span data-term="Freedom Association" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

So, no one currently claims ownership of the ruins found there.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_740"><span class="indent"><span>“Is that so… Then, as expected, it is necessary to carefully consider how to manage such a place…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_741"><span class="indent"><span>“Huh? Is there something that’s bothering you, </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-san?” </span><span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> asked, seemingly bothered by my reaction.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_742"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_743"><span class="indent"><span>The thing on my mind was, of course, the ruins under Clayman’s castle. Likely magical items and other things were sleeping in that place, so exploring it would, by my estimation, earn us some hefty profits.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_744"><span class="indent"><span>But there was something that bothered me. It was the question of rightful ownership surrounding the findings from the ruins. Another thing that bothered me was the potential of attracting unsavory adventurers in it only for the money or even distasteful outlaws.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_745"><span class="indent"><span>Although the proposal of digging up treasure in ancient ruins was enticing, we ought to consider their historical value as well. Investigating them can tell us a lot about how the ancient people lived back then. The world of ancient civilizations captures a certain sense of fascination. If we act too hastily, we will run the risk of destroying valuable information. That was my biggest concern.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_746"><span class="indent"><span>The ruins weren’t something I intended to hide from them, so I decided to discuss the matter with </span><span data-term="Yuuki" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and Kagali-san.

Is that true?!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_750"><span class="indent"><span>The moment I said that, Kagali-san shot a sharp stare at me, radiating an incredibly intense force that made my skin crawl. I was somewhat taken aback but decided to continue my explanation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_751"><span class="indent"><span>“Clayman had accumulated an immense fortune, and he also handed weapons and shields with magic effects to his subordinates. So I was wondering if he was making use of the things he found in those ruins, but—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_752"><span class="indent"><span>“—But?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_753"><span class="indent"><span>After hesitating a bit, I let out my thoughts.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_754"><span class="indent"><span>“It may be rude to say this to people who make a living with ruin exploration, but I refuse to tear apart the ruins merely for a chance of treasure. What kind of life and culture did the residents have and what ultimately lead to their downfall—these are the things I want to find out. Even if it’s just to make meaningful use of the past, I think we should show our respect to the ancient people.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_755"><span class="indent"><span>Well, those were probably just my overly emotional thoughts. It’s not that I didn’t have an interest in treasures, but I believed there to be something more important.

But that was still a future awaiting us several years from now.

Since it’s a request from my adorable junior, gladly—how could I ever refuse?” King Gazel announced his decision on the spot.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1011"><span class="indent"><span>He probably weighed the benefits after laying eyes on the rails and saw the potential.

I saw a new side of him.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1018"><span class="italic indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1019"><span class="indent"><span>There were those who went ahead and experienced the large bathhouse before the eve of the festival. Most deemed it favorable and had asked many questions to the one in charge of the bathhouse. I heard there were large bathhouses in other big countries, though many found the hot spring itself to be breathtaking. The ingredients providing the medicinal effects were a tightly guarded secret, severely hampering attempts to reproduce it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1020"><span class="indent"><span>I had received copious requests, asking us to introduce them to their countries as well, but I decided to gather and file those guests’ requests for later review.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1021"><span class="indent"><span>That said, all I could tell them was to please visit us often.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1022"><span class="indent"><span>Among the people who were satisfied after soaking in the bath, several were now sitting in the tatami room with a Yukata we provided them.

Their prickling gazes were unnerving, so I greeted them lightly and immediately announced the start of the banquet.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1025"><span class="indent"><span>“Ah, it is a pleasure for me to welcome you here today.

I would prefer for this night to be free of serious topics, and instead would like to direct you towards our nation’s dishes that I hope you will enjoy. Long speeches are not my strength, so please excuse me for cutting it short. I wish you all a grand time; let the party begin!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1026"><span class="indent"><span>The preparation was perfect. The way we served the dishes was the cherry on top. I hoped our sincerity could be conveyed fully.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1027"><span class="indent"><span>Each table had a waitress assigned and Vester strictly educated them to bring dishes with every request. Everything was laid out to serve the guests—the results of intense education and training were now on full display.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1028"><span class="indent"><span>I called for a toast after I finished my greeting.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1029"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1030"><span class="indent"><span>The eve of the festival had been set in motion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1031"><span class="indent"><span>Gasps swept through the crowds as they all drank a glass of cold beer.

After all, they were kept freezing cold.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1032"><span class="indent"><span>The method of preparing a cold glass cup, was something taught by the meticulous style of Japanese service. Even for my own sake, it wasn’t something I could compromise on.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1033"><span class="indent"><span>Not only that, but elven ladies were pouring alcohol. It wasn’t forced, you know? I only accepted those who voluntarily offered to help.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1034"><span class="indent"><span>This was another huge success. Beautiful elven ladies were roaming around the banquet hall carrying various kinds of alcoholic beverages. Those who were accustomed to wearing formal dress seemed to be enraptured by the Yukata adorned elves’ voluptuous figures. In addition, the way the elves greeted the guests by putting three fingers on the floor, shook the hearts of men equally among all nations. I could see their faces turn red even when they weren’t drunk. The view of the elves’ chests, laid bare behind the Yukata, must’ve been an alluring sight.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1035"><span class="italic indent"><span>Hehehe. Like I intended.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1036"><span class="indent"><span>I would say that this was the pinnacle of merging western and Japanese traditional culture. The heterogenous mixture of those clad in Yukatas among the nobles wearing formal attire made for quite the scene—it was something you could only see here.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1037"><span class="indent"><span>That was what we planned, but, nonetheless, it ended up being a wildly chaotic party. From a commonsense standpoint, this really looked like a mess. But if this bothered you, then you had already lost.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1038"><span class="indent"><span>I acted as if this was the norm and observed the condition of the guests.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1039"><span class="indent"><span>The extravagant dishes on the tables were made by </span><span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and Yoshida, who went through a lot of effort to create delectable meals, and I could confidently say that the guests would all be satisfied with them. Smoked chicken-duck meat and sandwiches filled with vegetables, cow-deer steak, fried vegetables marinated in sauce, karaage fried chicken, roast beef salad.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1040"><span class="indent"><span>We also prepared a sherbet made with an assortment of fruits as refreshments, and going so far as to recreate dishes like the black tiger meat stew and grilled fairy-leather bird from the Walpurgis banquet.

In the banquet hall, at the dividing line between the Japanese traditional space and the western space, a large fish was being carted in.

It had, in fact, a delicious, savory taste to all of that blubber, which was unthinkable, based solely on its appearance.

Someone who you normally could never meet, no, not only that, the empress of a superpower, who had not shown herself for tens of years, appeared. I should say it was natural for others to be causing a ruckus.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1167"><span class="indent"><span>Empress Elmesia </span><span data-term="Elaure" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span> <span data-term="Sarion" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. Someone who called herself a divine empress, was confidently walking into the venue. An incarnation of beauty, was the thought passing through everyone’s head as they gawked, bereft of words, at Empress Elmesia.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1168"><span class="indent"><span>I thought that as well. Because that appearance, no matter from which angle you looked, she was a beautiful girl. She had skin as white as freshly fallen snow, and soft, silver hair. Sharp, pointy ears and jade green eyes that seemed to see through everything.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1169"><span class="indent"><span>Gazel said she was a girl, so she definitely had to be female.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1170"><span class="indent"><span>If she was a </span><span data-term="high elf" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, then did that mean she was a pure-blooded fairy? Or she might’ve had blood that was infinitely close to pure. Calling her a fairy addresses too broad of a category, but they were said to be a race that evolved from great spirits, so this Elmesia standing before me seemed to be one of those ancient beasts from a time long gone. She was a big enough deal to warrant a warning from Gazel.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1171"><span class="indent"><span>I also needed to remain vigilant of the guardians protecting the Empress. From each and every one, I felt extreme power, despite them wearing formal garments. It must’ve been magic armor, and this was just my guess, but they were legendary-grade. The power I felt emanating from those formal clothes was equivalent to the feeling I got from the Moonlight rapier </span><span data-term="Hinata" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> wielded. Their skills would, naturally, be on equal footing with </span><span data-term="Arno" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and the Holy Knights. No, thinking about the quality of their weapons and armor, the Empress’s guards might’ve been superior.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1172"><span class="italic indent"><span>The world sure is big—</span></span><span class="indent"><span>that thought passed through my mind.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1173"><span class="indent"><span>Holding back one of her guardians from stepping forward, the Empress herself approached.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1174"><span class="indent"><span>“I am thankful for the invitation. I am happy about it.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1175"><span class="indent"><span>A mellow voice—I almost mistook it for charm magic, but it wasn’t magic at all. It was simply her voice being that charming.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1176"><span class="indent"><span>“I, too, am honored to meet you,” I answered in front of her, at which point I could see my own reflection in Elmesia’s jade green eyes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1177"><span class="indent"><span>&lt;&lt;Notice. ‘Mind Interference’ detected—Interrupted. This doesn’t seem like an attack, just an effect of ‘Heroic Spirit’ that seeped out.&gt;&gt;</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1178"><span class="indent"><span>This was dangerous. This person seemed to have a higher level of ‘Heroic Spirit’ than even Gazel. In other words, her strength was not only equal to Gazel, but there was a chance that she was able to top it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1179"><span class="italic indent"><span>Maybe she’s a </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> class? </span></span><span class="indent"><span>It would be good not to be hostile towards this person. This was a peaceful invitation; I would try my best to appease her in the hopes of friendly relations in the future.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1180"><span class="indent"><span>“Then, though it may not be up to standard, we have prepared meals as well. I hope you will enjoy yourself tonight.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1181"><span class="indent"><span>“Hmm, I am happy to receive such consideration from </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-sama. I expect a lot from the festival that will take place tomorrow, so please make me happy. And—” she said with a leisurely smile, then brought her face near mine, and whispered in a hushed voice only I could hear, “It doesn’t have to be today, but I hope you can make time for me. There’s something I’d like to discuss with an open heart, in a less formal setting.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1182"><span class="indent"><span>That informal way of speaking must’ve been Elmesia’s true self. As someone who was still not used to being a stern and dangerous </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, but had to play the part nonetheless, this made me feel a bit more intimate with her. And so, I answered: “Alright. I’ll contact you when the date is decided.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1183"><span class="indent"><span>Elmesia nodded with a look of satisfaction, then retreated to her guards’ protective circle.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1184"><span class="indent"><span>And just like that, Elmesia gave a cute, entertaining smile to the people who were preparing to meet her for the first time, while walking towards the table laden with food.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1185"><span class="indent"><span>On a side note, I was wondering why Duke </span><span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>, the person I initially invited, was nowhere to be seen, when I landed eye-contact with one of the Empress’s escorts. </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>No, wait a minute.

I was so exhausted that, while all eyes were on Elmesia, I snagged the opportunity to go and sit down in the tatami room. I thought tonight would be easy-going, because participation was optional, but a bigwig just had to show up.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1190"><span class="indent"><span>“Yeah, I’m really tired.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1191"><span class="indent"><span>“I felt like I was gonna fall over the moment I met her. If I don’t keep my mind straight, that grand—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1192"><span class="indent"><span>Gazel swallowed his words and shut his mouth. Then he mumbled a bit and ended up just drinking the cold alcohol.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1193"><span class="indent"><span>Seeing as how I could feel a terrible chill coming from Elmesia, that was probably the reason. </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>I wonder what Gazel was about to say?

You’re just as I expected. I knew that you didn’t mean to insult me, though I wanted to test, for a moment, how you would react. But this was very telling. That Milim will grow by your example,” Frey finished, this time showing a gentle smile from the heart.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1245"><span class="indent"><span>Milim being a tyrant was a thing of the past. In spite of her current appearance, her tendency to listen to others had markedly increased. Thinking that the reason for that was me, she used my slip of the tongue to test me. And probably intended to let Milim learn from my attitude. Bowing immediately was the correct answer.

I believe only in this way can we build a better future.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1535"><span class="indent"><span>I observed everyone’s reaction as I continued my speech. It seemed that everyone was intently hanging onto my every word. This not only applied to citizens of our kingdom, but also to the peasants that came for the celebration. I continued:</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1536"><span class="indent"><span>“Some may be wary of the fact that I am a </span><span data-term="demon lord" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>. While this sense of caution is understandable, I hope everyone would put trust into your genuine feelings. I won’t force you to accept my views. It would certainly be pleasant if you were to find me trust-worthy, but even if you are not willing to trust me, it is something that cannot be helped.

However, how the people interpreted my message was entirely up to them. Next, I addressed the royal ruling classes:</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1538"><span class="indent"><span>“Fellow nobles gathered today, I hope that you will relay what you see and hear here today honestly when you return to your respective nations. Some kingdoms have already established diplomatic ties with us. Even if you can’t put your faith in us, will you not find those nations trust-worthy?

It had to be a decision made by the nation as a whole. What everyone thought here wasn’t that big of a deal, but… I still wanted to believe that there was some use to say these things.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1540"><span class="italic indent"><span>But I’ll need to give them a fair warning, so we don’t end up with a </span><span data-term="Farmus" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> 2.0.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1541"><span class="indent"><span>“I won’t wage war against you simply for the fact that you did not cooperate with us, but if you treat us unfairly due to our </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> status, or attack us with the intention of invading: that is something we absolutely will not tolerate.

Perhaps some would consider me as a threat for doing so, but those were just my honest opinions. I disliked war, but if anyone dared to invade our kingdom, I would retaliate without hesitation. An indecisive ruler will only bring about harm, especially for innocent civilians.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1543"><span class="indent"><span>After all, ensuring the lives and properties of our citizens was the responsibility of the state.

A world without military conflict was nothing but an idealistic dream. A citizen had every freedom and right to dream about peace and prosperity, but that wasn’t a luxury rulers could afford. They needed to always be on their feet, ready to handle any situation that may arise. This was the bare minimum for a nation to function. That was my justification for the speech I just delivered to the higher-class guests.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1544"><span class="indent"><span>And to wrap it all up—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1545"><span class="indent"><span>“Whether you’re a merchant, adventurer, or peasant, I swear not to lay my hands on common civilians. But that does not apply to criminals. Our country is lacking in manpower. As such, there are plenty of jobs available, so anyone who wishes to fill an empty role can consider immigrating. Naturally, with more people come more opportunities. Here, you will have freedom of speech and the ability to choose the occupation that you desire. But even so, please speak and act responsibly. If you are still interested in our nation after my speech, please consider my proposition. There are all sorts of events planned for our nation in the future as well. Today’s Tempest </span><span data-term="Founding Festival" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> is but the first debut project. With that being said, I hope everyone will have fun!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1546"><span class="indent"><span>After that promotional message to the commoners, my speech concluded.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1547"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1548"><span class="italic indent"><span>Was that a bit too on the nose?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1549"><span class="indent"><span>Oh well, I didn’t really mind. I was just a clerk working nine-to-five in my previous life, which is why my speech was nowhere near as eloquent as those delivered by kings and nobles despite my quick rise to fame.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1550"><span class="indent"><span>But, even with that being the case—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1551"><span class="indent"><span>The crowd exploded into deafening cheers. My citizens aside, even the visitors were in an uproar. Although there must also be people who still had their suspicions, most people were willing to trust me and put their faith in this nation. That would do for now. It would be odd to have complete trust from the get-go. Our heartfelt thoughts had been delivered to everyone. All that’s left was to see their reactions.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1552"><span class="indent"><span>And so, with my speech, the Tempest </span><span data-term="Founding Festival" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was officially commenced.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1553"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="text-center indent line" id="line_1554"><span class="indent"><span>***</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1555"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1556"><span class="indent"><span>After the speech, I made my way to the main hall on the ground floor.

Now just add some sweet syrup on top of that… I had tried it before, and I could definitely vouch for its fantastic taste. The aromatic smell of soy sauce combined with the sweetness of fruit sugar was mouthwatering.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1676"><span class="indent"><span>This was all possible thanks to everyone’s careful preparations for this day.

He moved towards a building near the hotel. It was the opera house. We managed to redecorate the interior on a crunch, and the end result was more majestic than what we had hoped for. We only arranged these high-quality chairs in this particular manner after considering the acoustic effect in the theatre.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1691"><span class="indent"><span>The guests were seated properly.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1692"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1693"><span class="indent"><span>The standard of culture in this world was a bit lower when compared to Japan. This was…umm, a genuine observation even from other people’s point of view. While there was a relatively high artistic and musical achievement, that was limited to royalty and nobility. They were entertainment for the upper echelon that had both an abundance of money and time. The angels would assault any city that developed past a certain threshold. As a result, most aspects of advanced culture were tucked away in the realms of the privileged. To the nobles, these forms of culture were merely considered as minor entertainment. But to me, culture was something that required a collective effort to build together.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1694"><span class="indent"><span>Geniuses had been buried in this world. It was not only difficult to discover the genius in these fields in a world with such a narrow view, but they may also even be buried and eventually not be developed for their entire lives. Art is the product of entertainment spawned from extra vitality of life, and the same goes for any innovation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1695"><span class="indent"><span>In this world, the search for such things is a luxury, but I’m not giving up because of it. I will, however, search the world to discover the geniuses that were overshadowed by the average people. In order to achieve this, first I need to foster a culture appreciation trend within my nation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1696"><span class="indent"><span>And the first step is—today’s appreciation concert. There were plenty of musical instruments in this world that were similar to my original world. To my surprise, there was even something like a piano.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1697"><span class="indent"><span>And these were all discovered at Clayman’s base. He seemed to have been living life no worse than court royals. In one of the countless luxuriously decorated rooms of his, he had stored a large number of instruments. Some </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> already understood music.

They also had a culture of holding festivals every year. I loaned instruments to these people and, with time, their talents here and there blossomed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1698"><span class="indent"><span>We prepared instruments for those conscious of learning, and gave them basic instructions such as teaching them how to read music notes.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1699"><span class="indent"><span>My knowledge alone was hardly enough, and it was a time like this that </span><span data-term="Wisdom King" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> Raphael would shine. With the music schoolbook from Japan combined with the knowledge related to instruments within the library of this world, we produced a paper book.

I wasn’t someone qualified with traits such as “pitch perfect hearing,” but it was no problem for Raphael-san. Not only did it recreate the sheet music, it even re-composed the songs.

The curtain on the stage was pulled up. Members of the orchestra in uniforms emerged. The ensemble was made up of people from different races as they held their preferred instruments. Some looked like humans, others looked like beasts. There was a lot of variety. Everyone’s face was filled with confidence and pride in their instruments.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1707"><span class="indent"><span>A halfling came to the front, likely the conductor, and bowed deeply to the audience—I recalled this young man sighing that he couldn’t do anything. I told him as comfort that “There’s no such thing.” Even though he wasn’t good at accounting, his weak physique made him unsuited for construction work and he wasn’t cut out for farming either. When out of options, he went to be enlisted, but he couldn’t win in a fight either.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1708"><span class="indent"><span>While this was the case, he was good at raising morale. His singing voice was most beautiful and united the people. That’s when I recommended him to the army band. I had even given him the name “Taktstock”—</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1709"><span class="indent"><span>Taktstock then raised his face. Unlike his expression from before, his face was now filled with enthusiasm. As he graciously subjected himself to the judging eyes of the high nobles, he turned his little back to everyone. A small and fragile body, but his back was full of strength.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1710"><span class="indent"><span>Everything happened so quickly. These people were lucky that their talents were developed.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1711"><span class="indent"><span>He raised his taktstock (conductor baton), and the next second—they began to perform. A steady tone started, and soon was followed by a change into a solemn reprise.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1712"><span class="indent"><span>Under the conduction of Taktstock, the performers were acting in unison. They had also found things to be proud of. The music they were performing seemed to be announcing: “This is the best moment of my life.” It was mesmerizing.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1713"><span class="italic indent"><span>Classical music, these are famous songs that can be recognized in any era no matter where.

Moreover, considering that most of the guests are aristocrats, they may have been interested in the outcomes, but the production process would appear less significant.

The device possessed light-magic engravings. It was a treasure that could project colored images. The room turned dim as images emerged on the white cloth.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1842"><span class="indent"><span>Some people were very surprised to see this, but Vesta ignored them and continued the explanation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1843"><span class="indent"><span>“Then, please take a look at this image. This is the dissection of the aforementioned plant, and there is another dissection graph of a random grass—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1844"><span class="indent"><span>The two enlarged dissection graphs were displayed next to each other.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1845"><span class="italic indent"><span>He didn’t mention what type of plant it is on purpose, what is Vesta’s goal here?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1846"><span class="indent"><span>“—Aren’t these two the same thing?

How about it then, do they look the same?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1856"><span class="indent"><span>As Vesta finished, people with pertinent knowledge began to disagree with him.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1857"><span class="indent"><span>“They do look different. You can see the difference if you pay attention!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1858"><span class="indent"><span>“How devious of you Vesta-san. It’s so hard to see the difference between the images like this!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1859"><span class="indent"><span>The audience began to express their views.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1860"><span class="indent"><span>The hipokute herb was rare. It was the grass that I ate inside the sealed cave of Veldora. It was also the famous ingredient that produced healing potion.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1861"><span class="indent"><span>The dissection graph looked very similar to that of the grass. How could that be possible—that’s probably the average persons’ reaction. Including me, some had become shaken by the words of Vesta. Gazel was among them, his face looked quite shocked.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1862"><span class="indent"><span>The dissection graphs of the hipokute herb and grass were the same—this suggested that both </span></span><span class="italic indent"><span>were</span></span><span class="indent"><span>&nbsp;the same thing. Then, what even was a rare herb? The common sense of this world had been completely subverted…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1863"><span class="indent"><span>While the devious smile still hung on Vesta’s face, he spread his arms to have everyone’s attention.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1864"><span class="indent"><span>“Please, everyone, calm down, calm down.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1865"><span class="indent"><span>Vesta and </span><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> comforted the guests and quieted them down. As the room was back to silent, they continued to play the images.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1866"><span class="indent"><span>“The liquid extracted from hipokute herb mixed with magicule will become healing potion. The nature of the refined liquid determines the rate of the fusion, that is a fact that everyone knows. Regarding the point, while I can’t give you the details, we’ve managed to extract liquid with purity up to 99%. The medicine made from it is the full healing potion.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1867"><span class="indent"><span>They were displaying a series of images while hiding the key technology. Vesta also explained the production process of healing potions.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1868"><span class="indent"><span>“Then there’s the leaves of the hipokute herbs. When you grind them up and mix in magicule, you can produce ointment that can be applied on wounds. However, its effect is not as obvious. Because it is considered the remains of the refined extraction. You will obviously get such a conclusion from a certain point of view.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1869"><span class="indent"><span>A picture of the leaf was projected on the screen.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1870"><span class="indent"><span>When you ground up these leaves and mixed them with the refined extract, you could make ointment.

Its appearance looked completely different, so how come the picture of its dissection was the same…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1873"><span class="indent"><span>But after switching to a few different pictures, the image of hipokute herb began to change.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1874"><span class="indent"><span>“Has anyone noticed yet? I found it purely by accident. While I was growing hipokute herbs under </span><span data-term="Rimuru" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>-sama’s order, I came by some leftovers of the herb’s refinement waste. Even if we make them into herbs, as soon as our preservation method is not good enough, its effect would disappear. Moreover, compared to the juice of the healing potion, its effect is very low. Since these leftovers have always been prepared in one way, I’ve not paid any attention to it in the past. But back then, I thought carefully and realized that there’s really no need to specifically make it into ointment. I kept on pondering as I observed the leftovers—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1875"><span class="indent"><span>It was then that </span><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> discovered something.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1876"><span class="indent"><span>That was the shape of the leftovers’ leaves.

It was the high concentration of ‘magicule’ near its surrounding that caused this particular plant to mutate—”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1878"><span class="indent"><span>“Indeed! It was not that hipokute herb grows in areas with high magicule concentration, but that only in areas with high enough magicule concentration can its mutation take place. That is the true identity of the hipokute herb!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1879"><span class="indent"><span>As </span><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> concluded his explanation, Vesta continued excitedly. No wonder he was so thrilled. The audience was riled up as well after hearing their speech.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1880"><span class="indent"><span>“T-this is a major discovery!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1881"><span class="indent"><span>“Something like that, how can you publish that in a p-place like this, Vesta! Y-you need to find a more appropriate venue… You need to contact the universities and publish something like this by formal procedure!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1882"><span class="indent"><span>Noises abrupted at the scene and the situation was almost chaotic. Even those who were lacking in interest could not keep silent. As for the people who were intrigued from the start, the impact on them was even greater. The content of this showcase was beyond their imagination. From their exclamation that “You shouldn’t have published it in a place like this—” alone could you deduce just how shocked they felt. Even Gazel’s eyes were popping out in awe. Emperor Elmesia was also whispering with Duke </span><span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1883"><span class="indent"></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1884"><span class="indent"><span>I was scared as well. I hadn’t paid much attention to it until now, and was immediately brought to speed by their presentation. Now that I thought about it, this made a lot of sense. I didn’t think that there was all that hipokute herb in Veldora’s sealed cave from the start. If it were mutation—the plant itself evolved—then it would have made sense.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1885"><span class="indent"><span>These plants returned to their original state as ordinary grass when all of its magicule was extracted through the refinement process. When it is completely depleted of magicule, its dissection graph naturally looks just like your garden variety grass.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1886"><span class="italic indent"><span>I see, that’s why </span><span data-term="Gabil" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> thought of using a healing potion to fix the sword</span></span><span class="indent"><span>. Just as any ordinary grass could be turned into hipokute herb, minerals could be turned into magisteel ore. These ores could then be refined into “magisteel” and could be used to craft weapons. Therefore, he would naturally question whether healing potions could be effective on swords or not.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1887"><span class="indent"><span>The result of which was the demonstration at the start of the presentation.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1888"><span class="indent"><span>“As for my question ‘What is magicule?’, there has not been any clear answer. </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.capitalCase(this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term], true):}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and majins are also affected by magicule. That is a known fact. But what about demi-humans? Is it possible to make them human by extracting all the magicule from their body? Questions similar to these started pouring into our heads, but proving any of these would prove to be extremely difficult.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1889"><span class="indent"><span>“With that said, we will carry on with our research. There are many researchers gathered on this land, we promise to continue our search for the answer.

They managed to announce something so important without revealing any of the core information on the matter.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1896"><span class="indent"><span>The most important point was that through a presentation, you couldn’t really steal any of our technology.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_1897"><span class="indent"><span>Magicule could cause changes to plants—that was some wonderful information, but other nations may not have been easily able to research the matter.

After processing a selection of giant rocks, we embedded them in this empty lot. We first compressed the hard rock into a cube, two meters in length. We then arranged them carefully as a base.

Normal, hard rocks were already three hundred times harder than cement, and with magicules infused into the rock base of the colosseum, it became ten thousand times that. It was two meters thick alone, and its hardness put nuclear blast shelters to shame.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2238"><span class="indent"><span>I hadn’t done any real testing, but I was certain it should survive a direct nuclear magic strike without a crack.

This was largely due to him observing the hard work of his father as he grew. While the former king still ruled the nation, Gazel was having the time of his life during the last free period of his life. Apparently, it was then that he met </span><span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and Elmesia.

I couldn’t see it, but that was not the case for Elmesia. Picking up on people’s actual feelings was a piece of cake for the royal court. That’s why they were constantly wearing masks and deceiving each other cautiously… Looks like I needed to call Gazel my mentor in that regard, yet Elmesia was still treating him like an infant. No wonder why Gazel’s face was filled with disgust.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2921"><span class="indent"><span>Elmesia then exclaimed, “Let me have a drink as well,” as she took a glass of fruit wine from </span><span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>.

The two looked quite tacit, but they were both no different than children in Elmesia’s eyes, perhaps that’s why they were similar.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2923"><span class="indent"><span>But of course, also myself, who’s inexperienced had no chance of winning in a negotiation with Elmesia. That’s why Gazel told me to forget about it.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2924"><span class="indent"><span>“Ara, this tastes good as well.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2925"><span class="indent"><span>“You are too kind.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2926"><span class="indent"><span>The fruit wine poured by </span><span data-term="Shuna" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> seemed to have fit her appetite, filling her face with an even brighter smile.

If she were to dislike it, it would be difficult to prepare anything better. I was a little relieved as Gazel spoke up once more with emphasis.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2927"><span class="indent"><span>“Alright, that’s enough. Time is precious, I’m afraid there’s none to waste on your little hobbies.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2928"><span class="indent"><span>After his hurrying again, Elmesia was finally willing to talk business.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2929"><span class="indent"><span>“Alright.

Even though Gazel and </span><span data-term="Elalude" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were shivering, seemingly sighting omens, we simply did not care.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2937"><span class="indent"><span>And then Elmesia took out her magic wallet.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_2938"><span class="indent"><span>“I only have some pocket changes with me, at most one thousand gold coins.

They didn’t want any of their men to be injured. Even the slightest misstep could have cost them their lives, and so they would most definitely avoid fighting </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> that yielded no profit. Even though they didn’t really need to worry about dying in there, it would take some time for people to actually accept such a mindset.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3824"><span class="italic indent"><span>With that in mind, perhaps I should re-evaluate how I’ve been trying to promote the labyrinth…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3825"><span class="indent"><span>And soon, the battle began.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3826"><span class="indent"><span>Basson lunged forward to take on the great-bear’s attack. A look of desperation was etched on his face. The only thing between him and the </span><span data-term="monster" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> was a worn-out piece of leather armor. A piece that didn’t cover up his entire body and left his hands and lower sides completely exposed. He found himself in quite the precarious situation despite confronting an opponent weaker than himself. His great axe could land heavy chopping blows, yet it was not suitable to defend against a bear’s claws. That’s why Basson had been using his round shield to deflect the great-bear’s paw.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3827"><span class="indent"><span>His companions, on the other hand, were covering for Basson. To keep themselves safe, they were targeting the eyes and feet of the great-bear when launching attacks. The magician named Gomez, meanwhile, launched the great-magic spell Wind Slash to take its life.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3828"><span class="indent"><span>“And it’s at this moment that their battle to the death with the great-bear concludes! An excellent fight!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3829"><span class="indent"><span>“Indeed. Their actions were very logical and devoid of unnecessary complications. That was the style of experienced fighters.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3830"><span class="indent"><span>As I listened to </span><span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> and </span><span data-term="Myourmiles" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s broadcast, I mulled over the fight just now. Indeed, their teamwork was flawless. In the end, there were no casualties in Basson’s team, and they took around five minutes to take down the great-bear.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3831"><span class="indent"><span>But I couldn’t shake off the troubles as new problems started to emerge.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3832"><span class="indent"><span>“Oi oi oi, I didn’t expect them to fight so cautiously against an enemy far weaker than themselves…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3833"><span class="indent"><span>“Um—I was surprised too. But shouldn’t that normally be the case?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3834"><span class="indent"><span>“I suppose. Although not having drawn a map is indicative of poor performance, we seem to have underestimated their abilities.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3835"><span class="indent"><span>“That’s true, maybe it will take three days just to break through the first floor alone…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3836"><span class="indent"><span>“Um—if that’s the case, we should really think about quantifying the rations…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3837"><span class="indent"><span>I didn’t expect our project to be disrupted by something like this.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3838"><span class="indent"><span>Basson’s team had teammates of varying ranks, but their overall strength was the equivalent of Rank B. As for Basson and Gomez, with their good equipment, they may have been around Rank B in terms of skill. Yet we couldn’t have anticipated that such a six-man team had to struggle in a fight on the second floor already.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3839"><span class="indent"><span>In terms of results alone, it was their complete victory, though taking five minutes was perhaps way too long. However, as professional adventurers, they might also value safety more…</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3840"><span class="indent"><span>Maybe they should be taught to adapt different fighting strategies, perhaps they could adhere to the strategy of “Use healing potions even if it’s only a scratch” to improve their combat efficiency.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3841"><span class="indent"><span>Not sure why I was worried, but right now Basson’s party was approaching the treasure chest.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3842"><span class="indent"><span>“It looks like the room contained a treasure chest, it looks silver as well, what could possibly be inside…?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3843"><span class="indent"><span data-term="Souka" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s words had tensed up the audience. While the other teams had opened treasure chests several times by now, people were still highly interested in the instant that they were opened.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3844"><span class="indent"><span>One of Basson’s teammates went up and immediately threw the lid open.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3845"><span class="italic indent"><span>Oi oi oi, shouldn’t you at least check for traps?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3846"><span class="indent"><span>Silver chests weren’t set with traps, but Basson’s team had no clue of that. Just before this, they had gotten poisoned with paralysis and enveloped with sleeping gas. They also seemed to be taking turns when opening chests, but this wasn’t a punishment game… Their crude way of opening the chest even put me, as a spectator, on edge.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3847"><span class="indent"><span>In this regard, in the eyes of me, an epic gamer, I could only call them amateurs.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3848"><span class="indent"><span>Having treasure chests inside labyrinths was a foreign concept to people here… is that why they were so quick to do something so reckless? From this point of view, </span><span data-term="Elen" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s party was at least somewhat better. Their team had Gido, who, so far, had ensured that they wouldn’t trigger any traps while extracting items from treasure chests.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3849"><span class="indent"><span>Basson’s team’s issue probably came down to them not having a thief. Professional adventurers that exterminated </span><span data-term="monsters" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span> were probably the buff type who weren’t suited for situations like this. They should have hired teammates specializing in exploration.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3850"><span class="italic indent"><span>Hold up?</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3851"><span class="indent"><span>It may be that the difficulty of the labyrinth was higher than we expected. I thought that the issue was Basson’s party not being professional enough, but it would seem that a lot of people were simply not good at exploring a labyrinth. Their walkthrough couldn’t be made faster.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3852"><span class="indent"><span>I needed to reflect on the issue.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3853"><span class="indent"><span>“OH, WOWOWO! Basson-aniki, it’s a sword!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3854"><span class="italic indent"><span>NICU!</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3855"><span class="indent"><span>They seemed to have hit the jackpot. Moreover, the rare-grade jackpot deluxe. There were many different types of rewards, such as high-grade healing potions, ancient gold coins, or fine quality gear etc. We also designed it so that, starting from level two, there would be a very low chance of the reward being a rare-grade item.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3856"><span class="indent"><span>What Basson got was a rare-grade sword.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3857"><span class="indent"><span>“By the way, Mentor said that all of the treasure chests were designed to have higher reward drop rates!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3858"><span class="indent"><span>“I-is that so? But so far they have been getting shit rewards all around…”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3859"><span class="indent"><span>It was rare for Veldora to be so generous, yet it was ruined by Basson’s bad luck. No, had Veldora not raised the probability, they could have been getting shit gear even now.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3860"><span class="indent"><span>With that being said, obtaining this rare-grade sword was a game-changer for them. This would be great for publicity. Basson’s team would probably also want to test their luck even more. Upon thinking so, I had to compliment Veldora with a “Good job”.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3861"><span class="indent"><span>“For Veldora, this decision has been amazing. If you failed to leave these folks with some good memories, it would affect the future of the labyrinth exploration.”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3862"><span class="italic indent"><span>I’ll thank Veldora later.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3863"><span class="indent"><span>Basson’s men whistled upon laying eyes on the sword.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3864"><span class="indent"><span>They seemed to be very fond of the treasure.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3865"><span class="indent"><span>“You guys, let’s keep on going at this pace!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3866"><span class="indent"><span>Basson sheathed his great axe and changed his weapon to the sword.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3867"><span class="indent"><span>In the next room, three Rank D bats appeared, all cut down by him in one smooth slash. The quality of the sword had perhaps added a bonus to their overall effectiveness, they seemed to have become faster in dealing with enemies.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3868"><span class="indent"><span>This was a sword crafted by </span><span data-term="Kurobee" class="underline clickable selectable-term" onclick="this.app.selectNameEventHandler(event)">{:this.app.allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]:}|{allTermsChosen[this.parentNode.dataset.term]}|</span><span>’s disciple.

No wonder why Basson and his boys were so happy.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3870"><span class="indent"><span>As if they were making up for their previous losses, the party pushed forward confidently.

Yet to their surprise, there was a turn of events.</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3878"><span class="indent"><span>“Have we farmed enough?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3879"><span class="indent"><span>“Are we really going there now?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3880"><span class="indent"><span>“Uh… Aren’t you going to ask me about it…?”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_3881"><span class="indent"><span>“Of course we are going!

It’s not that simple to apply it universally!”</span></span></p><p class="indent line" id="line_4440"><span class="indent"><span>I managed to cover my tail with this explanation.
