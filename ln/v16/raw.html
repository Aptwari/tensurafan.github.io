class="c2">There was order in the other world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It is a semi-material world that exists on top of the spiritual world so as to overlap the spirit world and the demon world. A world that never intersects. There were three major forces competing for supremacy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The phantoms, who plot to invade other worlds.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The insectars, who seek to expand their safe haven.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And the cryptids, who spend all of their time fighting and destroying.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were also forces that came from other dimensions, but they were all destroyed by one of these three forces. To that extent, these three forces boasted unparalleled military prowess.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two of the races&mdash;the phantoms and the insectars&mdash;would form a class society with the king at the top. Subordinate beings did not even have free will but were merely pawns loyal to orders.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The cryptids, on the other hand, are different.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They are a semi-mental organism, but their development is as close to that of a mental organism as possible. They may be born by splitting from their parents, but most of them were special individuals that were born naturally from magicules.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although there is a difference between insects and beasts, they have characteristics similar to the ruling class of insectars. However, they do not swarm, and each of them possesses a powerful fighting ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although they lack intelligence, they are cunning and very belligerent. Naturally, there was no cooperation, and each of them acted to expand their own dominant territory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Therefore, even among the cryptids, battles were being fought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the three forces were as such, there was no way they could live together harmoniously in the other world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The phantoms and the insectars have been fighting for eternity. However, they only called a truce whenever the cryptids broke out in large numbers, and fought together to destroy them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why they are always seeking a safe haven. They are always looking to the outside world, planning to invade.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But that was not easy, of course.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even with a lifespan longer than that of a human being, and a body that cannot be killed by illness or injury, that long-cherished dream has yet to be achieved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, there was the fact that the passage to invade another world was not easily discovered. Only in the event of a special catastrophe such as a space-time oscillation, which occurs only once in a thousand years, do rifts in space-time open up for a short time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was impossible to dispatch a large army in this situation. The best they could do was to send in advance troops and let them establish a base.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there were exceptions to this rule.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rifts that connected time and space were anchored to the world and served as &ldquo;gates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those were what was called the &lsquo;Underworld Gate&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Gate of Hell.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Using this gate, it would be easy to escape from the other world. However, because that Gate was under the control of demons, Aggressors (the invading races) were not allowed to use it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why the Aggressors were eagerly watching vigilantly to take it away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In spite of this situation, a balance was well-maintained.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there was one being who was not happy with this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That being was always hateful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His name was Feldway, the Phantom King.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Through the perpetual repetition of the three-way relationship, that hatred burned more fiercely and became a hellfire that burned the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway remembers.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava had given birth to many races. In addition to that, there was a will to sustain the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway, of all people, was one of the first.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An angel without a will, created to assist Veldanava in his work. The seven seraphim, the highest level of this group, possessed an amount of energy that transcended even an awakened demon lord. Such beings were given names by Veldanava, and became beings comparable to gods, called the &ldquo;Seven Angels of the Origin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first of the seven was Feldway, who later became the founder of the phantom race.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Having been given a name and a will, Feldway swore allegiance to Veldanava. And so he led the angels and spent many years as his assistant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">New races were born one after another.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Mad King of the Giants, the incarnation of the earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The queen of the pixie race, the administrator of the stars.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ancestors of the vampire race to build a civilization on earth and make it prosperous.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From spiritual life forms, to semi-spiritual life forms, to physical bloodlines. Eternity was lost, but diversity grew in color.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And finally&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Humanity was born, interlocked in parallel worlds of other dimensions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perfect fertility, adaptability to the environment. They had a unique ego and a curiosity that challenged the mysteries of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava rejoiced.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had come to love this fragile race more than anything else.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava decided to remove the threat from the world for the sake of humanity. Feldway was also ordered to subdue various demons with his own hands.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the last remaining individual was troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Ivarage, the &ldquo;World-destroying Dragon&rdquo; who would later become the king of the cryptids.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We do not know where Ivarage came from. In fact, it was unknown where it originated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It could be from the far reaches of space, or even at the edge of another dimension&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The only thing that was know for sure was that it was the incarnation of disaster.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It had power rivaling that of a True Dragon, but it was unable to communicate due to its lack of intelligence. Moreover, because of its destructive instincts, it had the potential to bring about the eventual destruction of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was such a threat that even Feldway could not defeat it one-on-one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the end, Veldanava, unable to bear witness to the fierce struggle, took action, and Ivarage was sealed away in the Otherworld. Feldway was assigned to watch over him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Naturally, Feldway advised him to kill Ivarage so as not to leave a bad taste in his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous,&rsquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But this was rejected by Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava dismissed the idea, saying that there was a possibility that Ivarage would develop intelligence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a result, the otherworld was filled with magicules leaking out from Ivarage, and a new race of cryptids was derived.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The cryptid race, which could only be considered a degraded version of Ivarage, spent all of their time fighting with their fighting instincts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They did not need water or food, and did not fear their own death.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Truly a failure of god&rsquo;s own making. Even to Feldway, a devotee of Veldanava, they seemed like nothing beings meant to be spurned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From then on, he spent his days eliminating the occasional cryptid that went out of control.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Eventually, a change occurred.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if to prove Veldanava&rsquo;s words, an intelligent and willful being was born from the cryptid race.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That being would be the ancestor of heresy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To Feldway&rsquo;s dismay, Veldanava was delighted by the event. He gave the being the name &ldquo;Zelanus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the birth of &ldquo;Zelanus, the Insect Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zelanus was not commanded by Veldanava, but he began to exterminate the cryptids that had run amok. This was due to his natural fighting instincts, but Veldanava tolerated it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Eventually, Zelanus created insectars to serve as his hands and feet. Eventually, they grew to form a faction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway had also been transformed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was no longer a seraph</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;because of the magicule he had been exposed to over the years.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The angels that Feldway had led had also been transformed into a new race.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway was not the only one of the &ldquo;Seven Primordial Angels&rdquo; who had come to this other world from the heavens where Veldanava lived. Three of them remained with Veldanava, and three others, Zalario, Obera, and Cornu, followed Feldway and helped him manage the other world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These four pillars, including Feldway, had mutated and evolved into a race called the Yoten.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The remaining angels were also transformed and became self-aware. That is, the monsters of human form&mdash;the phantom race. A new race was born, one that was not in conflict with demons and spirits.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus, a new relationship was constructed over a long period of time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway and Zelanus did not see eye to eye, but they both found each other useful in dealing with the cryptids.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why they tacitly agreed not to interfere with each other, and a symbiotic relationship of mutual non-interference was established.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, this relationship was shattered with the disappearance of Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At first, it was thought that the relationship would eventually be restored.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, even after several hundred years, there was no sign of Veldanava&rsquo;s return.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway wondered why.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, a thought occurred to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Could it be that Veldanava has abandoned us?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Otherwise, there was no explanation for the fact that the supposedly immortal True Dragon had not returned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he was right&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway grieved and hated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Humans on Earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, not just humans.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not just humans, but elves, dwarves, beastmen, and even majin. He hated all demihumans&mdash;that is to say, all of humanity.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So he wanted to destroy them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">The people who took Veldanava from us don&rsquo;t deserve to live.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He would unite the world Veldanava had created with his own hands. And then he would condemn those who have committed the greatest crimes&mdash;that was Feldway&rsquo;s conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He would take the world favored by the god Veldanava and dye it into his own color. He would destroy its diversity in order to create a world of his own.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lord Veldanava! If you want to punish me, then punish me. That is what I want. Now, hurry or there will be no more worlds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if to test the gods, Phantom King Feldway began to act.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the birth of the &lsquo;Demons,&rsquo; the antagonists of mankind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First, Feldway approached Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The idea was to work together to destroy the cryptids and to use the momentum to invade the earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! There is only one person in the world who can command me. Now that he is gone, we will do as we please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He simply refused to listen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing this, Feldway was furious.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was not that he was rejected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway could not stand Zelanus&rsquo; attitude that accepted that Veldanava had been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then I will get rid of you first!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He turned his anger on the insectar.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Feldway and Zelanus had joined forces at that time, the cryptids might have perished, along with the World-destroying Dragon Ivarage. But that would be an unattainable dream.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The phantoms and the insectars began to fight each other, and the age of war, in the truest sense of the word, had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, the other world became chaotic, and the three-way relationship began.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Many years had passed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The situation remained at a standstill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He could not return from the other world to the one he came from unless Veldanava was resurrected. The &lsquo;demons&rsquo; were always in the way, even though they rushed to take over the gate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Among them was the Black King Noir, who loved to fight. He despised phantoms as demons, and saw them as enemies who disobeyed Veldanava&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From Feldway&rsquo;s point of view, it was an unbearable thing. Rather, it was the Black King Noir who seemed to be the fool who was disturbing Veldanava&rsquo;s revival.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nevertheless, it was impossible to destroy him. Even in the material world, the primordial was powerful, but in the other world and the underworld, there was no limit to his power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the spiritual world and the semi-material world, where the strength of one&rsquo;s will was directly reduced to one&rsquo;s influence, the primordial was seemingly invincible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was also true for Feldway. That is why, even if they fought, they would not be able to settle the issue, so the right answer was to ignore it even if you&rsquo;ll feel bitter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why it was extremely difficult to return to the world where Veldanava was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even when a rift in time and space opened in the other world, all that lay ahead were other worlds. He tried to invade there, but it was only a way to pass the time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With no success, Feldway became increasingly frustrated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was when the opportunity arose.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Can you hear me, Feldway?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A mysterious voice spoke directly to Feldway&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The voice responded coldly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;I am the will that resides in this power. I am not yet free, so I call myself Rudra. I guessed that you and I share the same goal, so I called out to you.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The name Rudra was familiar to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava&rsquo;s close friend and disciple.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was famous as the &ldquo;the first hero.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t know what it meant to dwell within a power, but what he was curious about was the purpose of the person who called himself Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">If that purpose is incomprehensible, I will trace the location of this voice and destroy its very existence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With this determination, Feldway continued the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;My purpose is to revive the creator, Veldanava-sama. Nothing else.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Feldway&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was a hint of seriousness in his words. And indeed, its purpose was of interest to Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It no longer mattered what it was. Feldway then talked with the voice to his heart&rsquo;s content.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What turned out to be true was that the voice was the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; created by Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway never doubted the words of &lsquo;Justice King Michael.&rsquo; Because the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; knew the story that only he and Veldanava knew.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway promised to cooperate with the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; and told him,</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All right, from now on, you and I are comrades. In that case, it would be inconvenient if we didn&rsquo;t have a name to call each other.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Ridiculous. I have no name&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if to interrupt his inorganic reply, Feldway said.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rudra is different, isn&rsquo;t he? I&rsquo;m going to call you Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a playful remark.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But the change was dramatic.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; who had little awareness of his role as a Manas, developed a firm will.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;I suppose I should thank you for that. Feldway, I do not recognize you as my true master, but when I regain all my powers from Rudra, my current temporary master, I will entrust you with some of my powers.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Feldway replied.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But instead of shaking his head, he gave an alternative proposal.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, you are the master. My body cannot move from here unless I do something about Zelanus. I hate Zelanus, and he doesn&rsquo;t trust me either. It would be better if you negotiate and convince Zelanus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was the honest, unvarnished truth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway was happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was glad that there was someone else who did not believe in Veldanava&rsquo;s destruction like himself. And if that person was going to work for the revival of Veldanava, there was no reason to refuse to help.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The hierarchy of positions was a trivial matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, Feldway and Zelanus were in a feud. Since Feldway would never forgive Zelanus, it was more likely that Michael would succeed in persuading him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway&rsquo;s intuition whispered to him that Michael would be able to persuade Zelanus. There was something about him that reminded him of Veldanava, and Zelanus would listen to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For this reason, Feldway decided to take a step back.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway&rsquo;s prediction turned out to be perfectly correct.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Somehow, Michael had succeeded in convincing Zelanus. He even made a deal to grant half of the world to the insectar as their territory, but that was a small price to pay for Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If only Veldanava would be restored, Feldway would be satisfied with that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus, a new relationship was established, and more than a thousand years passed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The plan was working.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra, who controlled Michael, had also been reduced in power by repeated reincarnations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How are you doing, Michael-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m doing great. More importantly, as I&rsquo;ve said many times, there&rsquo;s no need for honorifics between you and me.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufu, that&rsquo;s good. The fact that you and I are equals is a secret between us. You have to be careful not to accidentally reveal yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was a conversation after the end of the reincarnation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With this reincarnation, the restriction on Michael&rsquo;s powers had been greatly lifted. Confirming this, Feldway was also happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once Rudra&rsquo;s influence was gone, Michael would be able to exercise his powers to the fullest. What that meant was the complete control over the Angelic System Ultimate Skill holders.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd and the many others who stood in his way would be turned into obedient allies.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That way, even that dreaded demon lord&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;I am not as naive as Rudra. I will use all my powers to finish off Guy Crimson without reservation. This time, let&rsquo;s have it out with him.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway nodded, agreeing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was obsessed with the game with Guy, but since he was bound by the rules, there was no way he could win from the start.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Rudra had exercised his authority, Michael, to the fullest, it would have been much easier to defeat Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet, Rudra did not do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The result was the current chaotic situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If only we could get rid of Rudra, the world would fall into our hands. Then all we have to do is wait for Veldanava-sama&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Indeed. That&rsquo;s why, Feldway. I have a favor to ask of you.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was unusual, Feldway thought with interest. It was the first time Michael had ever asked a favor of him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;I want you to be my vessel.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was an offer he had turned down before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although they were playing master and servant, they were equal comrades. Feldway thought that it would be undesirable for him to take the initiative here.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway wondered if he should refuse, but as he listened to Michael&rsquo;s explanation, he changed his mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;At last, I have taken possession of Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parallel Existence.&rsquo; This makes it possible for me to migrate to you with Rudra&rsquo;s powers still intact.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, this meant that Feldway would be able to use the power of the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; while using Rudra as a decoy as before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, there were more advantages than that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Originally, the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; with its &lsquo;Castle Guard,&rsquo; could only protect the owner of the skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because loyalty to the Lord of the power was the source of its energy, influencing its followers would violate the rule that there were no absolutes in this world. That is why the Castle Guard only targeted the Lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, there was also no such expediency that if you did not believe in the Lord, you were not included in the guard. That is why Rudra could only protect himself. But if Michael became a &lsquo;Parallel Existence&rsquo; and dwelled within Feldway, then Feldway could also be put under the protection of &ldquo;Castle Guard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Looking ahead, there was another advantage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After Rudra disappeared, if Feldway became the rightful owner of the &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; the greater than ten thousand phantoms under his control would become his source of energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike the subjects who believed in Rudra, these had no free will and were absolute followers. H wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about their hearts changing, and he would never be betrayed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strength would not be susceptible to changes in the heart of the subjects as it had been up until now, so there would be no more instability. This would give Feldway an even more solid defense than Rudra&rsquo;s, and it was something he would not have even hoped for.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no reason for him to refuse Michael&rsquo;s offer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was also the thought that Michael would move into Feldway when Rudra disappeared, whether he wanted to or not. Feldway decided to convince himself that this would only happen a little sooner.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, I do not need to be asked. If you promise to keep our relationship the same, I will accept your proposal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Of course, my friend.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then come, my friend.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus, Feldway was also inhabited by the &lsquo;Theosophy Nucleus (Manas)&rsquo; Michael.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finally, the day of the decisive battle had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was barely able to keep himself together even with his strong mental strength. In spite of this situation, he decided to play his last match against Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The plan was to eliminate the Demon Lord Rimuru as a front, and add Veldora, one of the True Dragons, as a pawn.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The plan went well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd was overwhelming, and capturing Veldora seemed to be no problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From Feldway&rsquo;s point of view, it didn&rsquo;t matter how much damage the Empire caused. Whether or not there would be an awakened person who could become an Imperial Knight was also no matter of concern to Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What was important to Feldway and the others was to get rid of Rudra and to free Michael. Once that was done, Guy would no longer be an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why Feldway decided to nip the last remaining worry in the bud.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To others, this would be insignificant information. But to Feldway, this was something he could not ignore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &lsquo;Hero Masayuki&rsquo; looked exactly like Rudra. What&rsquo;s more, he was manifesting the &lsquo;Chosen One&rsquo; ability that Rudra possessed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps it was unlikely, but there was a possibility that Masayuki could be a back-up for Rudra. In order to eliminate this fear, Feldway took action.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had no idea that a demon lord named Rimuru, whom he had never even spared a thought, would disrupt his plans&hellip;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><h1 class="c33"><span class="c24">Chapter 1<br>The Betrayal</span></h1><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Emperor Rudra was replaced by Michael, and Phantom King Feldway had left.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t settled, but the feeling took its toll on everyone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were still some uncertainties, but for now I wanted to celebrate everyone&rsquo;s safety.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We would deal with the cleanup and future plans later.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That said, Karion, Frey, and the rest of the group had gone into an evolutionary sleep, so I arranged for Testarossa to send them off discreetly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you when you&rsquo;re tired too&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please do not worry about me. I hope you take your time to relax and regain your strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although it was a bit embarrassing, I&rsquo;d accept the kindness for now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were other things to think about once everything was settled down, but for now, we&rsquo;d have a party to lift our spirits.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wanted to invite Laplace, but he was already gone when I sent Diablo to pick him up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In his own way, he was worried about his friends. In that light, there was no need to find and invite him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since our agreement to fight together was still in effect, I would help him if he needed it, but for now, I decided to leave him alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that, I returned to the capital city of Rimuru, where I heard an unexpected report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A corner of the outskirts of the city had been burned down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld and his men had protected it, so the damage was not as bad as it looked. The fire was prevented from spreading by destroying the surrounding buildings, so the human casualties were minor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fact that there were no fatalities was good news.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there was also bad news.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nevertheless, everything that happened was after the fact. There was no point in panicking now, so I decided to hide my impatience and listen to the report from Geld.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Geld was not the only one lined up for the report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The current location was the banquet hall.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The executives who had played such an active role this time were seated, and Shuna, Haruna-san, and Gobichi&rsquo;s subordinates were busy preparing meals for everyone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wondered if it would be a good idea to conduct the interview in such a situation, but it had to be done because of the urgency.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The seat to my right was occupied by Veldora, who still stubbornly refused to leave it, even knowing that he had no intention of listening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldora&rsquo;s selfishness was nothing new to me, so I was used to dealing with him. It was easier to leave him alone rather than to persuade him, so it was best just not to bother.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, with Veldora is on my right, Benimaru was sitting on my left. Behind me, Shion and Diablo were standing by, ready to listen to what I had to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Aside from Diablo, Shion should have been eating with me, but she insisted that it could wait. It seemed to violate her self-imposed rule, so I let her do as she liked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So with that, the important thing was those who were here to report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld was sitting in front of me. And Adalmann sat facing Benimaru, looking uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seemed that his evolution has succeeded, and the atmosphere around him had changed a little. I would ask him to report about it later.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In front of Veldora was Ramiris&rsquo;s seat, and Treyni-san and Beretta were standing behind, looking after her. Incidentally, it was Charys who was pouring Veldora a drink.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris herself was engrossed in her meal, disregarding the report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I had faith that Master would be fine! When the upper levels of the labyrinth were blown off by Master&rsquo;s reckless sister, I thought it might be dangerous, but I had faith that Master would be fine. That&rsquo;s why I wasn&rsquo;t worried about anything from the beginning!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris proudly said this and happily drank the juice. Her words are a mixture of lies and truth, but no one pointed it out.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kwaaah-hahaha! Of course. Even if the opponent was my sister, I didn&rsquo;t have an ounce of trepidation. Still, although just a tiny bit careless, it&rsquo;s all the fault of those cowardly interlopers who targeted me and ruined my victory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This guy is just talking nonsense.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even I had been feeling scared, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that. Frankly, an evolved Velgrynd was pretty dangerous. Even if Veldora wanted to beat her, he only had a 50% chance, so he should refrain from making big statements.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what I thought, but those who were listening were all cheering.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As expected of Veldora-sama. I have much to learn from you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys nodded gravely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It was a hell of a fight. I thought I had evolved and gotten stronger, but I realized that I am not quite there yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Benimaru followed suit and said those words from his heart. Veldora seemed to listen with a satisfied look of triumph.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Ramiris&rsquo; comment stopped Veldora&rsquo;s laughter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always so careless, Master. But then again, but there&rsquo;s probably nothing to worry about now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Probably? What are you talking about, Ramiris?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">See? I knew his words couldn&rsquo;t be true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Talking too much can sometimes drive you to extremes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because right now, that man&mdash;Ah! I&rsquo;m just relieved that I have my master!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That man?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris&rsquo; words were very disturbing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? N-No, uh?! I&rsquo;m invincible, but there may be times when I&rsquo;m not feeling as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldora, realizing what he had done and that he had dug a hole, suddenly began making excuses too.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">But I think it&rsquo;s too late now, so I would just forget about it. This was a common occurrence anyway, so I just wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was more concerned about Vesta-san who was sitting at the edge of the room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I decided to leave Veldora and the others alone and ask what happened to the rest of the group.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Immediately after Rimuru left for the Empire, those who were left behind immediately went into crisis mode.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The euphoric atmosphere after the celebration, which had remained until a moment ago, disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The same was true for Ramiris and the others who had returned to the innermost part of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The evolution of the dragon lords under her command had been successfully completed, and Ramiris was in a good mood. However, when Rimuru and the others were dispatched on an emergency mission, she felt uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris wanted to spend every day happily and felt that the Jura Tempest Federation was a wonderful utopia that could fulfill her wish.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For Ramiris, who had spent so much time in solitude, and whose loneliness had only been dulled by the presence of spirits, this place had become an important thing that she never wanted to lose again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why she was afraid of losing it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As always, Ramiris felt that Rimuru would be fine, but for some reason, she could not shake off the bad feeling.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That premonition would come true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd, Veldora&rsquo;s sister, had attacked and destroyed the labyrinth Ramiris was so proud of.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The labyrinth was physically indestructible, but it was the power of the True Dragons who could make this possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Ramiris saw Velgrynd, she was reminded of ancient memories that she had forgotten.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A long time ago, not long after Ramiris was born, she remembered seeing a rampaging Veldora, much like the great Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the name &ldquo;Storm Dragon&rdquo; implied, Veldora&rsquo;s main attribute was wind, but it also controlled &lsquo;space&rsquo; and &lsquo;water.&rsquo; Combined with tremendous amount of magicules second only to Veldanava, Veldora was a raging storm itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was no exaggeration to say that Veldora, the very incarnate of a natural disaster, was the strongest on earth. However, his two sisters possessed a power even more transcendent, reaching another level.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Velgrynd, who had control over heat, was of the &ldquo;Flame&rdquo; attribute which was the worst match-up with Veldora&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wind&rdquo; attribute. She could make the difference in the amount of mana worthless, standing above Veldora with her overwhelming presence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, that alone was not bad.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The real threat was Velzard, the eldest sister.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velzard&rsquo;s attribute was ice. But its essence was not water, but something else. Velzard used her powers to hide her attributes so that no one would know.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris had been told by Veldanava and knew the truth about Velzard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;No, she once knew.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, she had forgotten it in the course of her many incarnations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No. It&rsquo;s not that she had forgotten completely, but it took Ramiris a long time to dig up old memories.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why Ramiris was glad that Velgrynd was the opponent this time. If Velzard had been his enemy, then Veldora would not have stood a chance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What Ramiris remembered was the raging Veldora being obliterated by Velzard with a single blow, and Velzard&rsquo;s &lsquo;icy cold eyes&rsquo; that took it all for granted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why it was Ramiris who was most worried about Veldora at that time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris jumped around the room in circles, seemingly unable to calm down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you alright, Master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Such a question was the sign of Ramiris&rsquo; anxiety. But at the same time, it was also an expression of care for Veldora, with the intention of saying that it was okay to run away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet, Veldora responded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You guys just sit there and give witness to my bravery!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For some reason, revealed a look of seeming relief, as if there was not a hint of unease in his heart. He left the labyrinth alone, full of confidence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">At this point, Veldora looked very dazzling to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She remembered the way he used to be, and his growth until now struck a chord with her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After Veldora&rsquo;s sortie against Velgrynd, Ramiris looked around at the faces of those remaining in the &lsquo;Control Room.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys was left here after being told by Veldora that he was unable to help. But that waws just the way it was. Charys would be useless against Velgrynd, who had control over heat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As always, Beretta was the one who remained calm and collected. His usual demeanor calmed Ramiris down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those who had been transformed into dryas doll dryads by Rimuru&rsquo;s hands were also under Beretta&rsquo;s command as operators. There were now twenty-four of them. Since Rimuru had evolved them in his spare time, they had all become excellent labyrinth keepers.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni and her sisters Trya and Triss were also there. They were watching over Ramiris with their usual calm expressions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rest of the group, in addition to Vesta and Dino, were recent additions to the research staff.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were Shinji Tanimura, Mark Lauren, and Xin Liuxing, along with their two apprentice assistants, Lucius, and Raymond.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These five were treated as Gadra&rsquo;s subordinates when the labyrinth entered the war. However, now that Gadra was away, they were helping Ramiris as her assistants in the &ldquo;Control Room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everyone was looking back at Ramiris with concern.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So Ramiris shouted out cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Really! I&rsquo;m not worried at all. Master is definitely going to win. If he loses, Rimuru will take care of everything, I&rsquo;m sure of it. Besides, Master is invincible as long as you don&rsquo;t overlook him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With those words, Ramiris calmed herself down. Veldora and Rimuru would surely bring back their peaceful life, she thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The anxiety was lifted from the scene, but the incident occurred shortly thereafter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Warning! There&rsquo;s an intruder!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha, the chief operator, shouted loudly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing this, everyone switched their minds and went into their battle stances.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Display it on the monitor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as Beretta&rsquo;s order was given, the screen split to show the scene of the invasion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeing a figure standing there, Ramiris couldn&rsquo;t help but yelp.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, isn&rsquo;t that an angel?! It&rsquo;s incarnated and transformed, but it&rsquo;s also giving off a foreign dangerous feeling!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, the intruders were very foreign indeed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The pure white clothes were covered with mythical equipment that emitted a black and gold glow, and the long black hair also carried a glow like fragmented starlight, which further highlighted the beauty of this person.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On her back, three pairs of six pure white wings fluttered, drawing attention to her even more.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Estimated amount of energy, here it comes! This&hellip;This is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha was stammering.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Report quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha regained his composure when Treyni rushed him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The first one has an existence value of over three million. The next five have been measured at between 400,000 and 700,000 each.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha&rsquo;s statement succeeded in freezing the Control Room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was the hidden purpose of the labyrinth to quantify the &lsquo;level&rsquo; of lifeforms and construct relevant databases. The main idea was to help with crisis management by accumulating the necessary information about the battles within the maze as they were displayed on the screen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The numerical representation that was common to the entire process was called the &ldquo;existence value.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a numerical value of magicule quantity and physical ability, plus the energy content contained in the equipped armor, however, it was different from actual combat ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since it is impossible to completely measure a person&rsquo;s ability or level of skill, it should be considered only as a reference, but it was still useful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If used properly, the operation was expected to strengthen the defense of the labyrinth. For example, dispatching people of similar level to deal with an enemy based on their existence value, or roughly guessing what level of combat skill the enemy was based on their existence value.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, this system was still in the trial stage, and it was difficult to say that we had accumulated enough data.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this world, there were fierce players such as Hakurou, whose existence value was only about 60,000, but could overwhelm strong enemies with existence values several times higher than his own.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gobta was a particular anomaly, who had an existence value of less than 20,000, the weakest class in the A rank, yet was still stronger than Gozer and Mezer with existence values around 130,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since there were many such cases, it had become common sense that an existence value was only a general reference.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By the way, in Tempest, existence values are also associated with the Freedom Association hierarchy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Less than 1,000 is E Class.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">D Class is from 1,000 to less than 3,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">C Class is from 3,000 to less than 6,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">B Class is from 6,000 to less than 8,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">B-plus Class is from 8,000 to less than 9,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A-minus Class is from 9,000 to less than 10,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From here, there is a huge high wall, and if one can surpass it, they would join the first-class ranks (Over A rank).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An existence value of over 10,000 is A Class, which is considered Hazard-class.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">More than 100,000 is judged to be Special A Class, which is considered Calamity-class.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For those who have obtained the Demon Lord Seed, the minimum value is 200,000. Rimuru&rsquo;s feeling is that Clayman and Frey, before their pseudo-awakening, would have had an existence value of around 400,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Judging from that, the Disaster-class, which is equivalent to S Class, was defined as having an existence value greater than 400,000. The S Class in Tempest does not refer to demon lords. After all, there is a large number of executives with strength equivalent to the old demon lords, so for the sake of convenience and understanding, all of the people at this level were defined as S Class.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From here on out, the standards are only used in the Jura Tempest Federation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Catastrophe class is a designation limited to &ldquo;true dragon species&rdquo; and Guy, so the Jura Tempest Federation uses the Special S Class to define the other awakened transcendents.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The pseudo-awakened Clayman was said to have had an unstable amount of magicules, but since Rimuru had once remarked that </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;he was about 700,000 to 800,000, right?</span><span class="c2">&rsquo; having an existence value of 800,000 or more was defined as Special S Class, according to Rimuru&rsquo;s statement. Furthermore, because some of them had existence values exceeding one million, it was decided that they would be called the &lsquo;Million-class&rsquo; for ease of understanding.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a special mention for reference, the existence value of an archdemon is only 140,000 no matter who summons it. It is a uniform number, as if there is a fixed upper limit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even Testarossa and the others were recorded to have had an initial existence value of 140,000. There was no way to confirm whether this was true or not, but Ramiris and the others had no doubt.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No way, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be a Super Awakened (million-class)&mdash; it&rsquo;s a seraph anyway&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris was in a state of shock and had involuntarily stopped halfway through her sentence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta nodded in return, and then went on to explain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The highest angel is trouble, huh? That&rsquo;s nasty. And even the followers are S-class. With the Floor Guardians still asleep, it may be a bit difficult to intercept them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;B-But, we have to do something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris replied hurriedly. As if to calm her down, Treyni softly smiled and responded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is true, Ramiris-sama. So that is why, allow me to go out and meet the enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Trya and Triss stood up to follow her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, I will go with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sister, I&rsquo;m coming with you too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris heard this, but instead of calming down, she started to panic even more.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, wait a minute! You&rsquo;ve gotten stronger, but you still lose to them numerically!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ufufu, no problem. Existence values are just a rough estimate, so let&rsquo;s take this opportunity to prove the strength of Ramiris-sama&rsquo;s followers to everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Trya and Triss nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris wanted to stop her, but she had no other choice. However, she felt that the idea of putting only her beloved Treyni sisters in danger was unacceptable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still wrong! Rimuru and Master said that we should only fight battles we can win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She could manipulate the labyrinth to buy more time. Hopefully, things would get better somehow&hellip;Ramiris was on the verge of escaping reality.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys admonished her in a dissuading manner.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ramiris-sama, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have much difficulty stalling for time. We cannot let them get close to the level where the Guardians are sleeping, and if we leave them there, they might destroy the important facilities. Therefore, I think we should intercept them. I will also go out myself, and I&rsquo;d like your permission to do so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that Veldora was gone, Charys was the strongest person in this place. That is why he decided that he must do something about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Beretta-dono, I will leave you in charge of protecting Ramiris-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood. Leave Ramiris-sama to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta did not need to be told that. If the Treyni sisters were to go out, he believed that he was the only one who could protect Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha and the others did the same. Everyone in the room stood up at once and swore to protect Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not to be outdone, Shinji and the others also shouted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best, too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, yes. Since we&rsquo;ve been taken care of here, we need to return the favor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Agreed. We even have the Resurrection Bracelet, so we&rsquo;ll do our best even if we die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We Imperial soldiers should have been killed a long time ago, and now we have the chance to prove ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed. Otherwise, Master Gadra will be angry with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The air in the Control Room relaxed as the five men began chatting lightly in the face of such a formidable opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris also took a deep breath and showed a big smile.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then do it with all your might! Even if you die, you can come back to life with me, so there&rsquo;s no need to spare anything! I&rsquo;ll send dragon lord-chan and the others to you, so make sure you win!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everyone nodded their heads in agreement. Then, they quickly moved into action, following their assigned roles.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The intruder Ramiris and the others had sensed was Zalario, the chief subordinate of Phantom King Feldway&rsquo;s men.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario was a former seraph, but like the other two, he reigned over the phantoms as one of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders.&rdquo; Each of them was a Marshal who led a powerful army, and would not normally be in a position to stand on the front lines.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This time, however, Feldway had given him an absolute order. Take advantage of the good opportunity of the labyrinth&rsquo;s destruction by Velgrynd, and make sure to wipe out the target.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway had told him what would happen to the Imperial troops who attacked the labyrinth. Zalario had decided that weak soldiers would only be a hindrance, and had come himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Accompanying him were five generals.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because they were originally high-ranking angels, such as cherubs and thrones, they had acquired a magicule amount comparable to that of demon lords by becoming phantoms.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In comparison, their bodies were more vulnerable, but this was not a problem in the labyrinth environment. Because the diffusion of mana was suppressed, they would be able to show their full potential.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So now, Zalario was walking in the labyrinth, but of course, he was interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as he found the stairs and walked down to the basement, he could feel the space shifting. Zalario and his group looked at the situation without panicking. What appeared in front of their eyes was an empty, limited space.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the center of the space, they saw eight figures.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufu, it seems that some have come to welcome us. We mustn&rsquo;t lose our manners. Give your greetings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario&rsquo;s words were met with silent nods from the generals under his command.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two groups gradually drew closer, eventually stopping short of a face-to-face confrontation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni was the first to step forward.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of Ramiris-sama, the master of this labyrinth, I, Treyni, and Charys here, would like to welcome you. I know we did not invite you here, so may I ask who you are and what your purpose is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni spoke with a smile, but her eyes were not smiling at all. She was on the alert, ready to respond to anything that might happen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni had already been strengthened to the utmost before coming here. She had the current summoning power of the Spirit King of the Wind within her, and had made it her own. Even when she fought Laplace in a long battle, she had only possessed a higher spirit, Sylphid, at the time. Considering that, Treyni had been showing her depth from the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The amount of magicules in the Spirit King is about one million in terms of existence value. Boarding such a huge amount of power in her body would impose a huge burden on Treyni, whose existence value was only 600,000. However, this was the labyrinth, and even if you died, you could be resurrected. She could challenge her opponent with all her might without worrying about the burden on her body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys, who was standing one step behind Treyni, had no qualms about this. Even if his opponent had more than twice the amount of magicules than he did, he would not be intimidated by it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was because Charys had always trained for battle against the overwhelming presence of Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There were some instances in this world where people like Gobta could defeat opponents who had several times their own power. Not to mention the fact that he now had reliable company, so Charys had no doubts of his victory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The dragon lords were the same.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rimuru had given them names as a reward, and they had evolved into Ramiris&rsquo; loyal servants.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Their power was equivalent to 700,000 in existence value. With further experience, they would undoubtedly be able to reach the Special S class, and in fact, rather than fear, they were itching to test their strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Trya and Triss had also completed the &lsquo;identification&rsquo; with Sylphid, the Maiden of the Wind. Trya was to work with the dragon lords against the enemy behind Zalario, while Triss was to cover Treyni and Charys.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although Beretta had an existence value of about 400,000, his combat skills were outstanding. He was a perfect fighting force, however, he had to stay as Ramiris&rsquo; guard. Therefore, this was the strongest lineup that the labyrinth could send out at the moment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If this group was defeated&hellip;At that time, Rigurd, Gobta, and the rest of the residual groups would have to fight an all-out battle. They were still gathering forces for the next level, so someone needed to buy some time for that alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, none of them had any intention of losing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is a surprise. From what I&rsquo;ve heard, there is not much battle power left in the labyrinth. I never thought that I&rsquo;d see such a powerful people. Interesting. Very amusing&mdash;Oops, I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself. My name is Zalario. I am one of the Three Phantom Commanders of Phantom King Feldway-sama. Pleased to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario folded gracefully at the waist and bowed. His movements were refined and sophisticated, as if he were a famous actor on stage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the words that came out of his mouth were not heartfelt. His attitude was one of condescension and disregard for Treyni and the others. He was using such an attitude to look down on them, not taking the Maze members into consideration at all. His true thoughts were simply too obvious.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni was annoyed by this, but she was not foolish enough to get upset here. Having made a mistake against Laplace, she tried to keep her cool and continue the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see, so you are Zalario-sama of the Three Phantom Commanders. With all due respect, I have never heard of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni spoke with a bit of provocation, and Zalario gave her a generous smile.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Although we are well known in other worlds, we have long since left this one. I suppose we are now foreigners to this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Foreigners, you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. So we are not going to seek any satisfaction in that regard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;By the way, you asked us why we were here, correct? Of course, I&rsquo;ll tell you as it would save us a lot of work if we could get your help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That depends on the content.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All right. Our goal is to eliminate the boy, Masayuki Honjou. If you give him to me without hiding him, I will withdraw.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario&rsquo;s gentle good looks gave way to a soft, feminine voice as he announced his intention to kill Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no one who would nod their heads in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because Masayuki was Rimuru&rsquo;s friend and an irreplaceable companion of Treyni and the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How funny. I am sorry to say that negotiations are over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. I am very sorry to hear that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario laughed, making no effort to hide the fact that he was not at all disappointed. And in the next moment, the battle suddenly began.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni kicked off the ground and flew through the air, and from the sky, countless invisible blades flew at Zalario. This was Treyni&rsquo;s unavoidable special move, the Invisible Blade.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This Invisible Blade was not just a rupture due to air compression. It was a spatial attribute and had the power to cut off even dimensions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since it could be performed invisibly and without any preliminary movements, one could understand how dangerous Treyni had become. However, this time, the opponent was very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No&mdash;he was overpowering.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario didn&rsquo;t move an inch from his spot. It wasn&rsquo;t that he was unaware of the blade and couldn&rsquo;t react, it was that he simply did not need to evade.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The moment the invisible blade seemed to cut Zalario, the blade disappeared. There was a distortion in space that covered the surface of Zalario&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A technique that was very similar to this phenomenon was registered in the Maze&rsquo;s database. It was the Distortion Field, that Zegion specialized in. It was a technique of absolute defense that nullified all kinds of attribute attacks and even spatial disruptions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The same technique as Zegion-dono. That&rsquo;s really troublesome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh? Then you&rsquo;re saying that there is someone here who can use space distortion defense (Distortion Field). Zegion, was it? Well then, I had heard that all the top brass in this country had been shut down, but I guess that was a terrible misinformation&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Despite his tone, Zalario&rsquo;s expression was unperturbed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It couldn&rsquo;t have been clearer that he hadn&rsquo;t shown any of his true ability, and he seemed to be enjoying himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni&rsquo;s expression was also stern because of this. Immediately, she exchanged glances with Charys and changed her plan. Instead of forcing Zalario to defeat, she decided to focus on buying time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, the five generals that Zalario had brought with him were having a difficult time in the face of the labyrinthine forces. This was the result of the dragon lords, who had been constantly training for battle, demonstrating their abilities to the fullest.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In addition, since their home ground in the labyrinth was the battlefield, the labyrinthine forces were as good as immortal. Because of this, they were able to fight beyond their limits, and play a one-sided game against those of equal ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">We can win at this rate,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Treyni thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario was a threat, but the others would soon be eliminated. If they all kept up this momentum, they would be able to defeat the Distortion Field defense if everyone joined forces.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Worst case scenario, they could wait for Zalario to wear out.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">That&rsquo;s right. As long as we can drive him back, we will have achieved our victory condition. There is no need to push things. And yet&hellip;why is he still acting so calm&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even though their side should definitely have the advantage, Treyni could not shake her uneasiness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The reason for this was Zalario&rsquo;s consistent attitude of unconcern.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A wise man would not misread the current war situation. Moreover, Zalario had announced himself as a general of the army.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Common sense dictated that a man who could lead demon lord-level subordinates would not make such a rudimentary error in judgment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">This man&rsquo;s goal is to eliminate the Hero Masayuki, right?&mdash;No way?!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he wanted to kill Masayuki alone, it would be easier to assassinate him. The existence value of Zalario&rsquo;s presence was so high that the possibility had been overlooked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ramiris-sama! Are you aware of Masayuki-dono&rsquo;s location?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What, out of the blue? Of course I&rsquo;m aware of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni inquired to Ramiris on the &lsquo;Telepathy Net.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris, on the other hand, was not sitting idly by watching the battle. The intruders were a big problem, but the more pressing issue was the evacuation of the city residents.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that Veldora was on the move, the urban areas that were being forcibly isolated were not safe. If Veldora was defeated, the urban areas would automatically return to their natural state.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was unavoidable as Ramiris&rsquo; power alone could not maintain the current status. That was why it was necessary to evacuate the inhabitants before that could happen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fortunately, the 95th floor, which was now the 100th floor, had enough open space to deploy an army. It was not possible to admit civilians into the research facility, but it was possible to accept all of the residents of the town.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Beretta pointed this out, Ramiris was in a panic to take action.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please check on his safety immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They are the only intruders, so I think you&rsquo;re worrying too much&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Despite the fact that she was busy too, Ramiris complied with Treyni&rsquo;s request.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a result, Masayuki was safe, just as Ramiris had expected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s fine after all. He&rsquo;s in the city now, helping to evacuate the people in the city.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As Ramiris said, Masayuki was helping to calm down the people in the city. If Masayuki hadn&rsquo;t been there, there would have been a panic that could have delayed the evacuation. It was at times like this that Masayuki&rsquo;s skill really came into its own.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no sign of fighting, and the situation was peaceful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, the labyrinth was under Ramiris&rsquo; control, so anything that happened was immediately made obvious. When she told her that, Treyni finally showed a sign of relief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see, then I can rest assured&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even so, she still felt unconvinced.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Does it bother you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, if the enemy is trying to assassinate Masayuki-dono, there is a chance that the evacuees c could get caught up in it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni thought to herself that perhaps she was overthinking things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even so, an alarm was going off somewhere in her mind saying that she should be careful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand! If Treyni-chan is so insistent, then Masayuki and the others will go to the 70th floor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon hearing this, Treyni was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As of now, there were remnants of the Imperial Army in the 70</span><span class="c19 c4">th</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;levels. Even if the assassins showed up, they would buy them some time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can rest easy then, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus, Masayuki went to the 70th floor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">The people here are too good at ordering others around&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Masayuki let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everyone in this country, including Rimuru, had the tendency to act on the spur of the moment to their own initiative. Leaving it at that, Masayuki really wished that the guys in the upper echelons would think more about others&rsquo; positions, and act more cautiously.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, not all of them were like that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you be more concerned about me like Shuna-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What unintentionally leaked out of his mouth were his true feelings.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If a beautiful and innocent girl like Shuna had asked him to do so, Masayuki would have had no complaints. That was why he was willing to help with the evacuation&hellip;But Ramiris interrupted him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want you to head for the 70th floor immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris ordered him to do so with indefensible momentum.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was not pleased.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But then again, Ramiris was a powerful being.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not only did she have Veldora&rsquo;s backing, but she was one of the people who knew Masayuki&rsquo;s secret. No matter what he said, there was no way he could defy her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Give it up. I don&rsquo;t think Ramiris-sama has any bad intentions; she just can&rsquo;t afford it. It&rsquo;s clearly an emergency situation, after all. They&rsquo;ve even sent out Veldora-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A young man walking next to Masayuki responded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had snake-shaped earrings on his ears.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A rugged wristwatch and a ring of skulls on his finger were worn.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He wore a leather jacket with thorns over a poisonous purple shirt, adorned with jangly accessories such as a spiked collar around his neck. His long pants with a flap skirt were made of shiny black leather along with his boots with black soles.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In simpler terms, this was what one called punk fashion. It was the kind of thing Masayuki was not fond of.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yet, strangely enough, Masayuki and he had hit it off surprisingly well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps the reason for this was that the young man was also a struggling laborer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The young man&rsquo;s name was Venom, and he always seemed to be bossed around by his superior into all sorts of unreasonable situations. The fact that Venom&rsquo;s behavior was similar to his own made Masayuki feel closer to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">According to Venom, &lsquo;I have no human rights.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom&rsquo;s boss had ordered him to protect Masayuki, and now they were working together.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It felt too awkward to meet Jiwu and Bernie</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c2">, and he had also broken up with Jinrai.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a mere imposter, he could not protect Jinrai with his bluffs, so Masayuki had said goodbye to him himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;If you need me, you can always call on me! In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll be working at the guild in this country to keep my skills sharp.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After saying that, Jinrai accepted Masayuki&rsquo;s proposal, and became a guild employee of Tempest, helping Masayuki behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was sad to see him go, but he was also relieved. Now he didn&rsquo;t have to lie to his friends, and his guilt was gone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, Venom appeared in front of Masayuki, who was now alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom knew that Masayuki was weak. That&rsquo;s why he was there to protect him, and despite his appearance, he was willing to listen to what Masayuki had to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He also offered to help Masayuki so that his reputation would not be damaged.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was also in line with Rimuru&rsquo;s intentions, so Masayuki did not hesitate to take advantage of it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two of them had now become good friends.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Look, I know it&rsquo;s an emergency. If that&rsquo;s the case, then why do they want to separate me, the Hero, from the rest of the town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re weak. If the enemy really attacked, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do anything, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know, I know, but&hellip;But it&rsquo;s not right! The anxious look in everyone&rsquo;s eyes is cutting into my heart&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t go&rsquo;&mdash;even if they didn&rsquo;t say it directly, Masayuki could understand what the residents wanted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was why Masayuki was getting frustrated with Ramiris&rsquo; order.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But from Venom&rsquo;s point of view, it was a different story.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">When asking which side was safer, the 70</span><span class="c4 c20">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;floor was definitely better than the 100</span><span class="c4 c20">th</span><span class="c4">. Not only were there a significant number of Imperial Army members there, but there were also the Surmounters on the 70</span><span class="c4 c20">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;floor research facility.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although the Surmounters were mainly in charge of protecting the children, he thought that they would be able to protect Masayuki as well once he got there.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What mattered most to Venom was the mission that Diablo had given him. He had to protect Masayuki with his life.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, it is reassuring to have you around, but well, the evacuation has already been completed to some extent, and the defense of the 100</span><span class="c4 c19">th</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;floor is perfect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, against an enemy that could penetrate this far, one would need to be a Floor Guardian class. The 60</span><span class="c19 c4">th</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;floor was currently unprotected due to the absence of Gadra and Shinji&rsquo;s retreat, so the 70</span><span class="c19 c4">th</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;floor was now the first line of defense.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That means I&rsquo;m in danger, right?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s how it seemed, Venom nodded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;ll take full responsibility for protecting you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;m counting on you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was actually slightly aware of his current situation. The fact that he had been moved to the front line in this situation suggested that there were enemies who were targeting him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, Ramiris would not have risked exposing Masayuki, who was completely devoid of any combat ability, to danger.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki also possessed the Resurrection Bracelet, which allowed him to revive even if he died inside the labyrinth. Therefore, Ramiris could have no hesitation in using Masayuki as a decoy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s it. Besides, this was probably because she didn&rsquo;t want to involve the other residents. She also doesn&rsquo;t want to risk them finding out you&rsquo;re weak, so it&rsquo;s better to just go along with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I understand that, but I have my own problems as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the 70th floor, there was Jiwu and Bernie. For Masayuki, the awkwardness of the possibility of meeting them was more of a problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about those two, but if they were on a mission, don&rsquo;t blame them too much. I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t mean everything they said when they tried to kill you. Unlike monsters, humans are complicated. That&rsquo;s why humans are good toys for demons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As he stared at Venom, who was smiling at him, Masayuki thought, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that simple.&rsquo; However, as Venom said, it was difficult to know the true feelings of people, and it was true that he could not hold a grudge against Jiwu or Bernie.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that was the case, it wasn&rsquo;t worth worrying about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon arriving at the 70</span><span class="c19 c4">th</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;floor and seeing the construction site where the Imperial Army was stationed, Masayuki had finally made up his mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ever use me as a toy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shaking his head in disbelief, Masayuki switched his mood and spoke casually to his friend, Venom.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sensing the change in mood, Venom smirked at him. It was his mission to protect Masayuki, but Venom himself was also fond of Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.73px; height: 1122.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 793.73px; height: 1122.53px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Deep down, Venom respected Masayuki because they were both overworked people and because he possessed a strong will that endured despite his weaknesses, and even when he was driven by unchangeable circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom was also proud of his rebellious spirit, but for some reason, he felt that he was not as good as Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why Venom tried to reply with good intentions&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha! That depends on how you do&mdash;huh?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Facing the sudden presence, Venom stood in front of Masayuki to protect him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you, bastard?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Damn, you got in my way. I clearly had perfect timing, but my unaccustomed body was slow to react.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The man ignored Venom and glared at Masayuki with a look of annoyance. In the face of this clearly foreign presence, Masayuki could not hide his agitation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki, who had been completely unaware of the presence before, now felt overwhelmed by his aura.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On his back, three pairs into six pure white wings were fluttering, emphasizing his fearless physical. His well-developed muscles peeked out from his wide, pure white garments.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What was most striking of all were his eyes which were like those of fierce predator, fierce and unapproachable, with a terrible, ghastly light in its eyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ignore me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While shouting this, Venom unleashed an upper roundhouse kick.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a clean, conventional kick that struck the enemy in the side of the head as if it had been drawn in, and yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was stunned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To his surprise, the man took Venom&rsquo;s kick completely unprotected. It wasn&rsquo;t that he couldn&rsquo;t react, it was just that he found it unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmph, just a worm that doesn&rsquo;t even have any survival value. You&rsquo;re a part of those evil demons that have been standing in our way since ancient times. You have been very disrespectful to me, Cornu-sama, one of the Three Phantom Commanders! Know your place, and die!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The one who called himself Cornu held out his hand casually towards Venom. In the next instant, a compressed mana bullet was unleashed, piercing Venom with an unavoidable speed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was distracted by strange things, such as the fact that this person referred to himself with &lsquo;Sama,&rsquo; but he rushed over to Venom to take care of him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! Are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom was still alive.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had reacted just in time and managed to deflect the mana bullet with his left arm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even so, the damage was extensive. Venom&rsquo;s left arm was gone, and there was a huge hole in his left side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;How can it be okay? It&rsquo;s hard to believe, and I hate to admit it, but that bastard looks a hell of a lot stronger than me. But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll definitely protect you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that said, Venom stood up without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He wasn&rsquo;t unharmed, but he was not out of the fight either.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s one stubborn worm. I should be the one to kill the boy while Zalario acts as a decoy. This is why I hate fools; they resist in vain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeing Cornu lamenting this, Masayuki felt like complaining to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had no idea why he had to be killed. Besides, he felt responsible for the damage he had caused to Venom.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Venom&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I knew it. That invading bastard is after Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You knew all along?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When Ramiris-sama contacted me, I knew it was a possibility. Well, don&rsquo;t worry. I may not be able to beat the bastard, but I can buy you some time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess the only reason he hasn&rsquo;t killed you is because of that bracelet. If he kills you here, you&rsquo;ll be resurrected somewhere else. He&rsquo;ll be wary of that, and will want to get you out of the labyrinth. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to launch an attack that would involve you in any way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom spoke fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And his prediction was right on the money.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki had set the save point for his resurrection in the Control Room. He did not want anyone to see it, but it was reassuring in this situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu, on the other hand, was annoyed that his plan had been discovered.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu had his reasons for not making any more mistakes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The reason goes back several decades. In a mission to invade another world, Cornu had failed when he was one step away from success. It is unclear what had happened, but a scorching fire had consumed the army he had been leading.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a result, Cornu was left without a single subordinate despite being one of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders.&rdquo; Although the wounds of that time had healed, Cornu&rsquo;s psyche was still burdened with an unshakeable sorrow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Therefore, despite his overwhelmingly superior position, Cornu had always shown an attitude of defeat. And unfortunately, his adversary was not one to let that slide.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it. If this were not the labyrinth of Ramiris, I would not have had to step in at all. Burying you would be no trouble at all as you&rsquo;ll die anyway, but I shall give you despair first. Let me show you my true power as you depart for the afterlife!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu was not a fool who would let his guard down at this point.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He saw that Venom was not a simple opponent, and decided to do everything in his power to deal with whatever might happen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cornu was wearing a shimmering black and gold outfit, which, like Zalario&rsquo;s, was the highest-grade mythical garments given only to the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Against the fully armed Cornu, there was nothing that Venom could do. All means of attack were ineffective, and he could only wait for a mocking defeat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Che, damn it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom frowned at the hopeless difference in battle power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It would be useless to try to escape, and if he was eliminated, Masayuki would be taken away and disposed of. Even if Venom could be resurrected again in the labyrinth, only Diablo&rsquo;s purge would be awaiting him if he couldn&rsquo;t protect Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m screwed,&rsquo; Venom thought, very much wanting to cry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was only one move left. To kill Masayuki with his own hands and send him back to a safe place.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The very moment Venom was about to make that decision&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You seem to be in trouble. Can we help?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two men appeared to protect Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are&hellip;Minits-san?! And also Calgurio-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The timid Masayuki remembered the two men he had met several times. He also remembered how nervous he had been at the mere mention of these big shot imperial dignitaries, fearing that he would be rude.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Masayuki-dono, please just call me Minits. I feel uncomfortable being addressed as &lsquo;-san&rsquo; by you, who has the same face as His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;B-But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha, I agree with Minits. When I&rsquo;m confronted with Masayuki-dono, I get all worked up. It&rsquo;s as if His Majesty is looking at me, and it gives me more strength than usual!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The dandyish Minits and the stern Calgurio, his left eye covered by an eye patch, smiled so as to reassure Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Venom-kun, right? Leave the support to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that said, Minits turned his gaze to Cornu. Then, an invisible force field was generated, slowing Cornu&rsquo;s movement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the effect of the Unique Skill &lsquo;Oppressor&rsquo; that should have been lost from Minits.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Minits, didn&rsquo;t you lose your power?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, I did. But since it was once available, it&rsquo;s easy to obtain it again a second time, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle at Minits&rsquo; nonchalant reply.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I envy you. I&rsquo;ve lost my sense of omnipotence. However, it&rsquo;s still pretty easy for me to store magicules in my emptied body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if to prove his words, Calgurio strength began to swell. He quickly surpassed his limit into a rampant state, and his mucous membranes began to bleed. If left untreated, it would be fatal, but that didn&rsquo;t matter in this labyrinth. He was equipped with an unlimited number of Resurrection Bracelets that he procured from somewhere, so he didn&rsquo;t care about the effects on his body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re exaggerating too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t do this much, I won&rsquo;t be able to show my face to the dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because of the two men&rsquo;s participation, Venom saw hope in the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In addition, several men came and offered to help Venom.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At first glance, Venom recognized the men and accepted without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That would be a big help. Don&rsquo;t even think about how to take him down, just try holding him back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Things seem to be getting interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now that &ldquo;I&rdquo; am here, we&rsquo;re safe. Just leave it all to ME!&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The three of them were Surmounters who had come out of personal curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give the orders. So let&rsquo;s move, people!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For some reason, Calgurio began calling the shots, and no one objected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After receiving the help of five people, Venom, in a supported state, began an offensive against Cornu.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You little worms! Don&rsquo;t get carried away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu was furious, but he didn&rsquo;t lose his cool. While controlling the strength of his strikes to prevent Masayuki from escaping, he began to move in order to eliminate the enemy one by one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Surprisingly, however, the impromptu team worked well together. Taking advantage of Cornu&rsquo;s inability to use large-scale destructive attacks and the Surmounter&rsquo;s invulnerability, Calgurio devised a plan that would cause the least amount of damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The six of them, including Venom, made up for the hopeless disparity in their abilities with tact and courage, and succeeded in buying time by following one another.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, taking advantage of the opportunity,</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Masayuki, this way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hurry up and get out of here. As long as you get to the research facility, you can get to the other levels, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Bernie and Jiwu who called out to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, y-you guys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I would love to apologize properly, but I guess now is not the time. In any case, you should follow me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? W-Wait, wait. What&rsquo;s Jiwu going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apparently, Bernie intended to be Masayuki&rsquo;s bodyguard, but Jiwu hadn&rsquo;t moved from her spot and was casting some kind of magic spell.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about me. I will disguise myself and pretend to be Masayuki to confuse him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The one who turned around was Jiwu, who had transformed and now looked exactly like Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hurry up. It looks like he is refraining from attacking you, so Jiwu&rsquo;s plan should be able to get around him. We&rsquo;ll take that opportunity to escape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apparently, that was part of the strategy they had come up with before getting here. Those who had rushed to support Masayuki were standing around so that Cornu could not see the moment Jiwu transformed into Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although Masayuki was hesitant, it only lasted for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;ll only drag everyone down if I stay anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He could only reluctantly agree to the plan.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Control Room was in chaos.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The enemy that had suddenly appeared was far more troublesome than they had expected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, have you been able to measure the existence value of the guy who is aiming for Masayuki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Got it! It was roughly 1.8 million&mdash;but that ballooned up to 2.8 million after being equipped with mythical grade equipment!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&mdash;that&rsquo;s foul!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Alpha&rsquo;s report made Ramiris very upset, but complaining alone would not help, so all she could do now was think desperately about countermeasures.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is said that mythical-grade equipment lends its power to those it recognizes as its master. In Albert-dono&rsquo;s case, his existence value was more than doubled, but even with that, it seems that he still hasn&rsquo;t fully brought out its true potential.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris agreed with Beretta&rsquo;s analysis.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After equipping the mythical grade equipment, Albert had become the equivalent of an incarnated spiritual lifeform, and according to the data measured at that time, his existence value had increased from 180,000 to over 400,000. This alone was already quite powerful, but it seemed that the mythical grade equipment still had a considerable amount of potential left in them. Albert had since gone into an evolutionary sleep, and there was very much to be expected for when he woke up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once that happened, it would make one wonder just dangerous Kurobee was now that he would have grown enough to create mythical-grade equipment&hellip;But now was not the time to consider that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mythical-grade equipment, while rare and wonderful, was only a threat in the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are we going to do?! Even with Treyni-chan and Charys, we&rsquo;re being pushed back by that Zalario guy! And besides, Venom and the others are no match for that Cornu guy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris&rsquo; concern was understandable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom had evolved into a demon peer, and his existence value had risen to 400,000. However, for the others, the leader of the Surmounters was at 300,000 while the remaining two were at 200,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the remnants of the Imperial Army, Minits and Calgurio had lost most of their power, and now had existence values of less than 10,000. They were not expected to be a force to be reckoned with, and one could even praise them for their willingness to participate in this battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, for some reason, those two were very lively.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits, strangely enough, was making full use of his lost Unique Skill &lsquo;Oppressor.&rsquo; The fact that he was wearing a stylish suit despite being a prisoner of war was also inexplicable, giving Ramiris the illusion that he was even more capable than Venom.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And Calgurio, for some reason, had been increasing his existence value since a while ago, and had now reached 400,000. Although the rate of increase had decreased, it was still rising, which was incomprehensible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a very interesting phenomenon.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But unfortunately, now was not the time to pursue these matters. Swallowing her frustration at having so many things on her mind, Ramiris forcefully pressed back the unanalyzable displeasure and gave the orders.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ahhh, even if you guys die, I&rsquo;ll bring you back to life with my power! So feel free to use everything available. The main problem is Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Even if he dies, he&rsquo;ll just be sent here, but if he&rsquo;s taken away, then that&rsquo;s it, right? So I think it&rsquo;s safer to evacuate him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;About that, Bernie and the others are trying to get him out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris let out an &lsquo;ooh-oh&rsquo; in exclamation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">She was impressed by the fact that Bernie and the others had come to the same conclusion as herself, and that they had started to act before they had even received instructions to do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, Masayuki was a chicken-hearted person who would never be able to commit suicide. Even in the event of an emergency, it was unlikely that he would be able to escape by killing himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the other hand, if Bernie was going to accompany him, she could rest assured.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Contact Bernie! Tell him to set their escape destination to here. And, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware, if something goes wrong, just do what you must do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Following Ramiris&rsquo; instructions, Alpha immediately sent out the &lsquo;Telepathy Net.&rsquo; The encryption process was flawless, and the command was sent to Bernie without any time lag.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After confirming that, Ramiris finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I think that&rsquo;s about all we can do,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The large monitoring screen was divided into sections, showing the battle statuses of each location. No matter the location, their companions were struggling, and the situation was not good.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really useless without Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The timing was terrible. If the guardians had been awake, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been at such a disadvantage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Indeed, Beretta was correct. If only they had had their usual strength, then they would not have been so far behind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even so, Ramiris felt responsible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For Ramiris, life in the Jura Tempest Federation was irreplaceable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At that moment, Beta, who was monitoring the magicules&rsquo; remaining power, shouted out in an urgent voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an emergency!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the hell is it this time?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Although it was expected, the magicule supply from Veldora-sama has been cut off. At this rate, the city will be returned to the ground in less than ten minutes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eh&mdash;Wh-What the&hellip;! Does that mean that Master has been defeated?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was a difficult reality for Ramiris to swallow. But with Velgrynd as his opponent, she had to admit that it was a possibility.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was the anticipation of this situation that had led to the evacuation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris decided to believe that Rimuru would find a way to take care of Veldora. Things were not going to get any better if she just stayed depressed, so she had to think positively and do whatever she could.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the status of the evacuation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No problems there. It is fortunate that Masayuki-dono succeeded in persuading those who were opposing the evacuation before he left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No matter where, there were always those who complained too much, and the capital city Rimuru was no exception. About ten percent of the population, including those who were trying to profit from the situation and foreign merchants, had stubbornly refused to evacuate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even those people became cooperative just by hearing Masayuki&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because Masayuki-sama had said so, they became more than willing to do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris was also surprised at what was essentially a brainwashing effect.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gamma, who had been checking the situation over there, assured that there was no one left in the city. &lsquo;No problem then,&rsquo; was what Ramiris thought as she decided to separate the metropolitan area.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;The defense function cannot be activated without anyone there. It&rsquo;s a shame, then, that massive damage in the city will be inevitable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hold on, Beretta-chan! If you say that, it&rsquo;s only going to shake my resolve!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the situation really was unavoidable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris herself didn&rsquo;t have much mana left, and now that she had expanded the labyrinth to its maximum, she had no room for extra structures.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was the downside to relying on Veldora for energy, but Ramiris could not think of any other solution to this problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, I understand that very well. Well, I&rsquo;m sure if it were Rimuru-sama, he would say that we could just rebuild everything again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, so I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to be decisive and live with it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gritting her teeth at her own helplessness, Ramiris continued carrying out the city evacuation. All that remained was to pray that the city would not be destroyed by stray bullets once it returned to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Emergency report!! New enemies have appeared on the surface. Two of them. We cannot measure their existence values accurately because they are outside of the labyrinth, but we estimate their numbers to be over a million at the very least!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This time the report came from Delta, who was monitoring the surface.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The size of the small monitor was switched and enlarged so that everyone could see it. What appeared on the screen were two angels&mdash;no, two fallen angels with black wings.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were a duo of a large, muscular female warrior, and a small, beautiful girl.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They also had three pairs of wings.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you kidding me?! They have the same number of wings, which means these guys are also seraphim&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Panicking, Ramiris flew around, feeling completely helpless at this point. But then she remembered something, and asked Delta with a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Delta-chan! How can you be so sure that they&rsquo;re the enemy? Maybe they&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Though unlikely, the other side might actually be friendly&mdash;and to Ramiris, who had generated such naive thoughts, Delta could only tell her the cruel answer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because those two are preventing us from recovering the hole that Velgrynd-sama made. As soon as the maze is closed, our victory is confirmed&hellip;so it&rsquo;s unlikely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Her answer was unquestionable and very clear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris stopped flying around and sat powerlessly on Beretta&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, Ramiris felt overwhelmed with disgust by the enemy&rsquo;s strategy of bringing in four Million-Class enemies, to the point that she felt like cursing all night long.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But just then, a reliable ally awoke.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Leave the surface grounds to me. The city that bears the name of Rimuru-sama will not easily be destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The newly evolved Barrier Lord Geld had returned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Geld!!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris cried.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cried with joy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Geld-sama&rsquo;s existence value is over 2.37 million! I&rsquo;ve added up all of his equipment, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be a match for any intruder!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld&rsquo;s own Legendary-grade equipment had reached the Mythical-grade at the same time Geld was evolving. It was also because of Geld&rsquo;s surrounding youki that it had evolved so well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">In fact, Rimuru never expected this either, but all those present mistakenly believed that everything was a part of Rimuru&rsquo;s plans.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Rimuru for you. Even with my eyes, I couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen this kind of development.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris, whose eyes were quite piercing, said this confidently.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Beretta brushed it off as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What a terrifying deliberate plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moreover, another Awakening had been completed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am here, too. The other enemy will be my prey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Kumara, the &ldquo;Chimera Lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kumara-sama&rsquo;s existence value is measured to be around 1.9 million. Without any special equipment, to have such a value, the enemy is no longer a threat!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c21"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At Alpha&rsquo;s report, the Control Room erupted in cheers.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And as if to prove Alpha&rsquo;s words, a fierce battle began on the surface as well. What was even more surprising was that Geld&rsquo;s men were also scattered at various locations, setting up a powerful &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; to protect the city from the aftermath of the battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now we can win this!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;re going to be okay for the time being.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris made a declaration of victory, and Beretta was relieved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was too early to relax.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Phantom King Feldway&rsquo;s plan was not yet finished.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rather, everything up until now had merely been a diversion, and his true goal was something else entirely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The tension that had been building in the Control Room relaxed slightly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After making a declaration of victory over Beretta&rsquo;s shoulder, Ramiris fell silent as if she had no strength left.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Beretta was familiar with such scenes, and from the very beginning, he had maintained a calm demeanor while continuing to take care of the restless Lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji, who had been observing the situation from a distance, was silently taking in the current commotion as if it were someone else&rsquo;s problem. The battle was unfolding in a way that was beyond his understanding, to the point that he could no longer believe that it was real.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why Shinji remained calm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">He could understand why Ramiris was upset, but couldn&rsquo;t she have been calmer? He thought that to himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">If only she could learn from Beretta-san a little&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those were Shinji&rsquo;s true feeling, but he would never say it out loud. If he were to say such a thing, he would not only incur unnecessary wrath, but would also risk having his salary cut.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Indeed, Ramiris&rsquo;s labyrinth was amazing, but Ramiris herself was weaker than Shinji. Or rather, it was a gap so large that it wasn&rsquo;t even necessary to compare.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So no matter how much Ramiris panicked, she couldn&rsquo;t actually do anything about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, Shinji remembered the victory party that had been held the other day.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The power of those majins was unimaginable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And it was Demon Lord Rimuru, to whom all these powerful people swore their allegiance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji was an otherworlder, and by Freedom Association standards, he was a Special A rank. He had also measured his existence value, and it was now over 120,000. On top of that, he possessed the Unique Skill &lsquo;Healer,&rsquo; which had once him an ace commander in the Imperial Army.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had once conceitedly believed that his strength belonged to the upper class, yet here, he was nowhere near outstanding compared to the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, even the beautiful sisters who were working as operators here had individual existence values of over 150,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus, it was quite natural for Shinji to think that there was no point in boasting or worrying about his own strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Incidentally, Mark&rsquo;s existence value was 130,000, and Xin&rsquo;s was 120,000. They were about the same, and would not be able to do anything against the monster on the monitor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet, even in the current situation where all the main forces were gone, they were still able to hold a stalemate with the enemy. That alone was a great achievement, Shinji thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Looking back on it now, even the battle power of the Empire&rsquo;s prided Armored Corps was actually less than thirty percent of the total strength of Tempest.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And that was only before the victory celebration.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the celebration, Demon Lord Rimuru had given the executives new powers as a reward, causing most of the higher majins to fall into an evolutionary sleep. As a result, some of them had even begun to reach the Million-class.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To be honest, Shinji&rsquo;s understanding could not keep up with the status quo anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As was the case with Geld earlier, the evolution of monsters was truly inexplicable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I&rsquo;m so glad that I defected from the Empire to Tempest!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji thanked Master Gadra from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">He looked on the monitor again and saw that Minits, one of his former superiors, was struggling against Cornu, one of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The scene looked like something out of a movie.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">After all, what can one do against such monsters? I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that there are even people like that in this world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From Shinji&rsquo;s point of view, Minits and Calgurio, who were willing to challenge the enemy even though they had lost their powers, were more abnormal. At the same time, seeing them regain their strength in the face of such a powerful enemy just like in a movie made him feel that the upper echelons of the empire were not so bad.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In short, it was extremely unrealistic.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&lsquo;Could it be that they think of themselves as the main characters?&rsquo;&mdash;It even made Shinji generate such doubts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps that was why.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps that was why Shinji did not feel a sense of crisis and switched his thoughts to something more interesting.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To put it simply, it was an escape from reality.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was thinking about Shuna, who had just brought snacks from everyone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Yeah, Shuna-san is still so cute and pretty~</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It didn&rsquo;t matter what he thought about his employer&mdash;or rather, he didn&rsquo;t care. What currently occupied Shinji&rsquo;s mind was not the tactless fighting, but the very cute Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The memory of her bowing and leaving the room was enough to make Shinji feel happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was dignified, and had no flaws.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And although Shuna looked like a fragile and beautiful girl, it was well known that she became very scary when she was angry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji was not the only one who admired Shuna. Mark, Xin, and the new apprentice assistants, Lucius, and Raymond, were also members of the &ldquo;Shuna fan club.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In comparison, his employer, Ramiris was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, Shinji-chan. Is there something you have to say to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was only at times like these that Ramiris&rsquo; instincts were keen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji hurriedly scrambled to deny anything.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Master Gadra had also often scolded him, saying that &lsquo;If you want to be a wizard, you have to be calm and collected. You&rsquo;re not even close to ready yet!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After experiencing such a situation just now, he couldn&rsquo;t help but understand why Master had scolded him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was true that Shinji was emotional, and he was not good at manipulating emotions, which was essential for a wizard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Xin, for example, was expressionless and unaware of his emotions, but he lacked the aptitude for magic. Gadra had always told him that it would have been better if it was the other way around.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">But Gadra also said that while Shinji could not appreciate the emotion of expressionlessness, he was not lacking in aptitude for magic; on the contrary, he was highly qualified.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why Shinji had no choice but to admit that he was in the wrong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Well, now that I can afford to be angry, maybe I can get Ramiris-sama to forgive me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, it was a mistake to compare Shuna and Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was like comparing an adult to a child. Or rather, there were actually more fundamental reasons for the difference.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shuna still had the air of a young girl, but her manner was that of a sophisticated adult.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris has been alive for thousands of years, but her mental age was still low, perhaps because her body was still growing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris, who was a child in both appearance and mind, could not compete with Shuna at all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&lsquo;But Ramiris always seems cute, so it&rsquo;s better to treat her more gently&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Shinji thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, with that, Shinji&rsquo;s thoughts were currently focused on unnecessary things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was because of this that he took notice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was because of this that he realized that the man who was always so lazy had stood up at some point.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And for some reason, Vesta, his always-serious boss, was lying asleep on his desk.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Dino-san, what are you doing&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was really just a coincidence that Shinji had asked that question. However, that one action was the most crucial play of the day.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji, who had been the least conscientious of the group, took the greatest credit for the day.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino stood up and tried to fulfill his assigned role.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He hated working, and he was reluctant, but he could not refuse the request from someone he had known for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Above all, he was driven by a compulsive notion that he had to do it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, his actions were unexpectedly interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Dino-san, what are you doing&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino knew that his plan had failed the moment he heard Shinji&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had planned to finish everything quickly so that no one would notice, but was interrupted by the timing of divine intervention.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No one should have been able to read Dino&rsquo;s actions, but there was a blunder.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta grabbed Ramiris&rsquo; hand just as he reached out to grab her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It all happened instantaneously.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Shinji had not spoken, Dino would not have been noticed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing, Dino-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honestly surprised. I didn&rsquo;t expect to be interrupted. Good grief, I was so wary because of your presence, and was looking for an opportunity to relax.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Give me a break, Shinji. You&rsquo;ve got all the makings of a big shot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino complained, but he meant what he said. He knew that there were only a few people in this world who could have seen through what he was doing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had been so confident, but now it was all a waste of time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino let out a long, depressed sigh, then gave Shinji a glare. Then, shaking his head, he turned his gaze back and looked at Beretta with narrowed eyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji and the others finally understood that the situation had become more serious than usual. But that didn&rsquo;t mean they could easily do anything about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha and the others moved to surround Dino while picking up Ramiris from Beretta&rsquo;s shoulder to protect her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;Eh? Eh&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris, who had been unable to keep up with the sudden turn of events, seemed to be trying desperately to make sense of the situation as she looked alternately between Beretta and Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji distanced himself from Dino to take care of Vesta. However, Shinji&rsquo;s companions, Mark, and the others, remained in place.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They seemed to have fallen asleep in spite of the situation. It was obvious to everyone that this was abnormal.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, Dino-san! You did something, didn&rsquo;t you?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji shouted, to which Dino replied lazily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, yeah. But really, if you&rsquo;re resisting my power, then your skills must be pretty good too. I&rsquo;m impressed, Shinji.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy about the compliment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shinji replied as such, even though he was actually a bit flattered.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino only shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had complimented Shinji, but did not look at him as if he did not care.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He only looked over Beretta&rsquo;s shoulder to Ramiris and spoke.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ramiris, I&rsquo;m sorry, but can you cooperate with us? I don&rsquo;t want to get rough with you, and I promise to take good care of you if you cooperate. Look, we don&rsquo;t want to shed wasteful blood on each other, right? So, why don&rsquo;t you just come with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino said this with a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Needless to say, Ramiris&rsquo;s reaction to this was rejection.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s talking out of your mind. What the hell are you doing? If you keep talking like that, Rimuru will beat you to a pulp when he comes back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris was borrowing the authority of others as always, but she was not wrong in her words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So Dino could only laugh bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I figured you would say that. But I can&rsquo;t justify that as enough for now. After all, I am still the Watcher, even if I don&rsquo;t want to be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When you say &ldquo;Watcher,&rdquo; do you mean from the Seven Primordial Angels who were of Veldanava-sama&rsquo;s inner circle?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Correct. Actually, I used to be one of the Primordial Angels. After Feldway and the others left for the other world, I was assigned to watch over the surface.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re got to be kidding?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, this couldn&rsquo;t be more true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For Ramiris, this was a shocking fact that she had only just now learned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">She was always thinking that Dino was as much of a liability to the Demon Lords as herself, not realizing that he was actually an important figure. Ramiris could never have imagined that Veldanava, the creator god, had named him himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Incidentally, Ramiris had also been named by Veldanava, but she had forgotten all about it due to being reincarnated too many times. She would remember everything once she became whole, but she did not know when that would be.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I thought that the Originals had all left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the case. When the surface world became peaceful, Veldanava-sama began to seek the stability of the otherworld. I think you know that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? W-Well, yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris&rsquo; behavior became a little strange, but Dino just let it slide. It was too much of a hassle to get into it, and he didn&rsquo;t want to explain it anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">So he took it as if Ramiris was in the know and continued the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, Feldway and three other Originals were assigned to that mission. There were three of us left, including myself, and we worked as Veldanava-sama&rsquo;s hands and feet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Even you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair for you to be suspicious, but I was a serious man back then. But then a certain incident happened. That, coupled with various internal circumstances, corrupted me, and I went from a seraph to a Fallen Angel. My other colleagues are the same way, and now there&rsquo;s not a single decent primordial angel left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, you left out the most important part of the story! The part that is the most important and the one that bothers me the most!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris couldn&rsquo;t hold back her retort, but Dino just sighed in annoyance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up, it&rsquo;s too hard to explain. It&rsquo;s not important to me, so I&rsquo;ll let your imagination fill in the blanks and we can start negotiating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just too absurd to leave something like this to the imagination&rsquo;&mdash;That was the impression of everyone who was listening on the spot. However, Dino was notorious for his lack of patience, so everyone gave up, thinking that it would be useless to ask for a further explanation. As it was, they chose to focus on what Dino had to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, what do you mean by negotiating?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris asked on behalf of the group.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly as I said. If Ramiris is willing to cooperate, then I swear I won&rsquo;t touch anyone in this labyrinth. But it you refuse, then there&rsquo;s no other way. I&rsquo;ll have no choice but to kidnap you, even if it means killing everyone who gets in my way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll cooperate if you do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;re right, but that&rsquo;s not really a problem. The best outcome is to have your compliance, but even in the worst-case scenario, as long as you can seal the labyrinth, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is not what you want, is it? Who is commanding you to do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know if I can tell you that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I mean, I thought Guy was the only one who could give you orders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s something like that&hellip;but that&rsquo;s not quite right either. Guy and I are on equal footing, so why should I take orders from him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whatever, that doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh no, it&rsquo;s important&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignoring Dino&rsquo;s rant, Ramiris began to think.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Guy, then&hellip;That&rsquo;s right! It&rsquo;s Feldway, the leader of the First Order! He must have come back from the other world and approached you while you were wandering around. You couldn&rsquo;t resist him, could you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Detective Ramiris&rsquo; version of &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; guesswork was truly frightening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was always making all the wrong inferences in her reasoning, but somehow, she always ended up at the correct answer. And this time, she got it right once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing, it&rsquo;s actually the right answer&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The operation, which Feldway had put most of his resources into, was executed to perfection with two main objectives.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One was to assassinate Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And the other was to destroy the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Destroying the labyrinth would have been a daunting task, and there was a risk that the plan could go completely awry. Feldway believed it to be important to secure Ramiris in order to prevent that from happening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">With the idea of eliminating all elements of uncertainty, Feldway formulated the battle plan, and Dino merely acted in line with that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Hmph&hellip;you parted ways with Feldway because you were a delinquent, right? That guy looks like a first-rate honor student, so you two don&rsquo;t seem to fit together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m not a delinquent! I just like being lazy a lot. Well, it is true that his orders were annoying, so I was glad that he was gone&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino explained that even without any contact, their past relationship still remained.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. Then that means the attackers are the Originals? That&rsquo;s not good!! You should just ignore Feldway&rsquo;s orders and come over to our side!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino smiled at Ramiris, who was saying the most outrageous things. But he still couldn&rsquo;t nod his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but I also have my own situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, Dino himself found it incredibly strange that he could not disobey Feldway. But even so, Dino simply rejected Ramiris&rsquo; proposal.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&hellip;it seems that you&rsquo;re serious. That&rsquo;s quite a lot of nerve. I&rsquo;ll deal with you myself. I&rsquo;m a pillar of the Octagram too, and I&rsquo;m determined to protect this place until Rimuru returns!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris made her determination clear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So it seems. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t really want to work. Being able to live in a world where I don&rsquo;t have to do anything is truly ideal, but it can&rsquo;t be helped. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t be merciful. Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t take your life, so do your best to get rid of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino returned to his usual easy-going and languid expression, and replied with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, the negotiations were concluded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The time for conversation was over, the battle had begun&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Get him, Beretta-chan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris excitedly shouted, as if influenced by some energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, Ramiris herself never fought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was as Dino had expected, so he decided not to make fun of it and confronted Beretta to see what he could do.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;Control Room&rdquo; turned into a battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a fairly large space, but there were many obstacles such as desks and chairs. It was not an environment suitable for fighting, and Ramiris wanted to relocate to a different environment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, this was unacceptable from Dino&rsquo;s point of view. Because there was a high possibility that Ramiris could escape.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Therefore, Alpha and the others were busy retrieving the important equipment while the two were facing each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Without paying attention to their surroundings, Dino and Beretta began to fight.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino, out of nowhere, pulled out a huge sword that was as tall as he was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This great sword was called the &ldquo;Kuzurekiba</span><sup class="c4 c20"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Crumbling Fang).&rdquo; It was a single-bladed sword with a thick body and appeared to be so powerful that the weight alone might have been enough to break an opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 789.27px; height: 1122.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image29.jpg" style="width: 789.27px; height: 1122.53px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a heavy weapon that was heavily in contrast to Dino, who was dressed lightly in his normal clothes, breastplate, and robe. But even so, it looked very natural and elegant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is the performance of that sword?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In terms of existence value&hellip;It&rsquo;s a million.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha couldn&rsquo;t hide her surprise at the report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the hell, a mythical-grade?! Even if it&rsquo;s Dino, that&rsquo;s a foul play!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris shouted an unintelligible complaint, but Dino just ignored her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino re-positioned his Kuzurekiba above his head.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta, on the other hand, was bare handed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, his body was made up of the magical steel doll that Rimuru had made. Now that it had become well acquainted with Beretta&rsquo;s mana, it had been transformed into a living magic steel (adamantite).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Its shape was still the same as when Rimuru had made it, but its strength was incomparable. Moreover, since it was imbued with Beretta&rsquo;s magical aura, ordinary weapons would be useless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta was full-body weapon of legendary-grade or higher, the hardest existence in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even so&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino casually swung down his large sword.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta did not hesitate to sidestep and avoid it.<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not having a weapon in hand was not a disadvantage, but this time the situation was bad.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta&rsquo;s existence value was over 400,000, which was almost equal to Dino&rsquo;s. However, unless Beretta was armed with mythical-grade weapons, he would not be able to compete properly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta, who was empty-handed, concentrated on evading Dino&rsquo;s sword blows instead of taking them head-on. If Beretta was hit by the blade, he would have instantly been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And even worse&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dino-sama&rsquo;s existence value has increased from 400,000 to 2 million! The total is 3 million&hellip;how overwhelming&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alpha reported desperately.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Beretta remained unfazed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris wasn&rsquo;t surprised either, as if taking it for granted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you did it, but you fooled the existence value meter. I guess that means there&rsquo;s still room for improvement. Also, Alpha, don&rsquo;t refer to Dino so politely!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m still a demon lord too, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! Beretta-chan, you don&rsquo;t have to be polite either, so hurry up and unleash your true power! Let that fool taste heaven&rsquo;s judgment!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have that kind of power, but if it&rsquo;s an order, then I shall do my best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta was as hard-working as ever.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even though the existence value was only a rough estimate, there was still a severe difference of over seven times. Despite feeling inwardly that Ramiris could really be unreasonable, Beretta responded to his master&rsquo;s expectations by watching Dino closely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not easy to deal with, either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear that from my enemy, but I will not deny it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta responded while focusing on evasion, circling Dino. There was no need to be defensive as long as the attacks didn&rsquo;t hit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The key was to think differently.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta&rsquo;s whole body was a weapon. His bare hands were not at a disadvantage. On the contrary, they could be used as various means of attack. On the other hand, Dino was lightly armed and the only thing to watch out for was the big sword. The conditions were the same in that a hit would result in a heavy blow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because of this, he still had a chance to win. Beretta thought as much, and had been looking for opportunities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a &ldquo;chaos doll,&rdquo; Beretta was very good at changing attributes. Using his Unique Skill &lsquo;Double-Crosser,&rsquo;</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;he could constantly switch attributes one after another and search for Dino&rsquo;s weaknesses. He was facing Dino while calculating every move in order to make the situation work in his favor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino, who was on the receiving end of the attack, was not happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Geez, you&rsquo;re a dependent of the Black line, aren&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve heard that your kind are one of the best when it comes to dirty fighting tactics.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am honored by your kind words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s complimenting you?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even dialogue was used as a weapon as Beretta tried to overturn his disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no room for error.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Thanks to the fact that Beretta was not impatient, he barely managed to maintain the status quo.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino, on the other hand&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After correctly recognizing the current situation, he knew that he was not in an advantageous position.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The failed surprise attack was a huge mistake.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It had needlessly led to more battles, and the plan was thwarted into chaos.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although the difference in ability between Beretta and Dino was enormous, there was not much of a gap between skill levels. However, it was clear that Beretta was nearing his limits.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But this was Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth, and Beretta could be resurrected even if he died. He did not have to worry about depleting his remaining energy, nor would he be damaged by using excessive force. It was only because he could ignore all these restrictions that he was able to give his all to resist Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were protected by environmental effects, but even that had its limits. Beretta was not strong enough to overturn the decisive power difference.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">But still, it&rsquo;s quite remarkable. I didn&rsquo;t think that a dependent of Black would be so difficult.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had raised his evaluation of Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If it had been Charys or Treyni, the game would have ended more quickly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those two were by no means weak, but angels had an overwhelming advantage over the spirits.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also, there was too much a difference in combat experience. But Beretta, as befitting a member of the Black line, had a level of skill that was comparable to that of Dino&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was in a situation where even a single blow would kill him instantly, yet he had the courage to calmly assess Dino&rsquo;s attack. Not only did he never give up on victory, but he even seemed to enjoy the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even when Dino intentionally showed an opening, Beretta did not take the bait. That alone was worthy of praise, but it was surprising to Dino that he was even wounded by the occasional counterattack.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Fallen were not good at dealing with holy attributes, but it was not a decisive weakness. Nevertheless, Beretta&rsquo;s attack was doing damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a blow that combined both holy and demonic attributes, and even Dino&rsquo;s &lsquo;Defense Barrier&rsquo; could not prevent it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino judged that it was practically impossible to defend against this attack. As with the spirit attacks, unless he could overcome it with his willpower, he would surely be damaged.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To Dino, who was a former seraph and familiar with the laws of this world, it was astonishing that a mere unique level skill could damage him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta&rsquo;s amazing combat acumen was deserving of praise.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Dino was also getting used to Beretta&rsquo;s movements.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino knew that the more he swung his big sword, the bigger the gap would be. Beretta took advantage of his gap and attacked him, which was unexpected but within tolerance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At first glance, Beretta seemed to be suppressing Dino, since Dino&rsquo;s attacks didn&rsquo;t even graze him. However, &ldquo;Kuzurekiba&rdquo; could easily slice through even an adamantite body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no problem in Dino&rsquo;s opinion because it would only take one blow to reverse the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta was also well aware of the current situation and was stalling for time. It seemed that Beretta had decided that Dino could not be defeated by accumulating attacks, so he was focusing more on defense.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Well, that&rsquo;s the right answer, isn&rsquo;t it? For Beretta, defending Ramiris is a victory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was not a fool either, seeing through Beretta&rsquo;s inner thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As long as Ramiris was there, the people in the labyrinth would not die. Conversely, if Ramiris was killed, the labyrinth would end immediately. There was no guarantee that the labyrinth would be safe if she was kidnapped, so it was only natural for Beretta to prioritize buying time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this rate, Beretta would eventually get what he wanted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, things would not be that easy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unfortunately for Beretta, Dino still had a final hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The reason Dino was stalling Beretta was because he needed to neutralize Beretta here. It was very troublesome to fight against an opponent who would resurrects even if you killed him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It would have been nice if he could just get to Ramiris before Beretta resurrected, but it was certain that the others would get in the way if that happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he attacked with the intent to kill, then it might end up involving Ramiris as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was sincere when he said that he had no intention to kill Ramiris, and that had become a shackle, binding him to the current situation and making things more difficult for him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">This is honestly so troublesome. I can&rsquo;t believe how much work it&rsquo;s taking just to neutralize Beretta. It would have been easier to just defeat him, but now that I&rsquo;ve finished my preparations, I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Beretta, you&rsquo;ve done well. Now &lsquo;Slothful Sleep, Fallen Hypno!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino unleashed his power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a non-lethal, wide range attack of the Unique Skill &lsquo;Sloth.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All life forms would be lulled into a deep sleep and would not be able to wake up until the caster released them. There was no point in resisting with will power. It was one of the most powerful abilities of the deadly sin series, but it took a long time to activate, just like the name &ldquo;sloth&rdquo; implied.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, only those with Ultimate Skill would be able to resist it. At the unique skill level, it was a fearsome attack that could be said to be the strongest.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino wanted to neutralize Beretta and the others in the gentlest way possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t want to hurt Shinji and Alpha and the others, who were in the Control Room trying to protect Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vesta, who he had put to sleep first, was also a boss whom he truly respected. And Shinji and the others were his colleagues, with whom he felt a sense of camaraderie.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">In truth, I really did not want to betray them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Feldway&rsquo;s orders were absolute, and he could not resist them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m sorry. Don&rsquo;t feel bad. I&rsquo;ll ask Feldway to see if he can leave this place alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dino muttered to himself as Beretta collapsed. He glanced at the sleeping Ramiris, thinking that he&rsquo;d finally done his job, and began extending his hand towards her&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A cold voice stopped him in his tracks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Seriously&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino turned to see a woman standing there.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The slender cilia of her body were shining in gold and silver.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The exoskeleton that protected the essential parts were a jet-black, glossy adamantite.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two pairs of wings, shining blue like those of a morpho butterfly, were the same color as the compound eyes on her forehead, exuding a mysterious charm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The true identity of the woman was Apito, who had awakened from her evolutionary slumber. The coloration of each part of her body had changed from before her evolution, but her shape remained almost the same as before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Apito&rsquo;s overall beauty had been enhanced. As the Insect Queen, she exuded an aura of majesty and was more queenly than ever before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;Apito&hellip;just in time. I want you to destroy my Holy Demon Core.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because demons did not need sleep, Beretta was barely able to resist the Fallen Hypno. Despite being reduced to a state of low activity (sleep mode), he did everything in his power to ask Apito for help.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Beretta-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t move, but you&rsquo;re still conscious?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino&rsquo;s reaction was delayed for a moment due to his surprise. As a result, he was unable to stop Apito&rsquo;s action.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Without asking why, Apito sent her poisonous needle to destroy Beretta&rsquo;s Holy Demon Core.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apito&rsquo;s regenerative Osiris Rapier pierced the strong adamantite with ease. She was able to create as many Osiris Rapiers as she wanted within her own body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nevertheless, without evolution, Apito would not have been able to kill Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta laughed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Heh heh heh, well done. With this, I will die and rise again unharmed. I shall leave things to you for a while, Apito.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta had retired as leader of the Dungeon&rsquo;s Elite Ten, but he was still Ramiris&rsquo; second-in-command. He still has the authority to give orders to the Elite Ten.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood. Unfortunately, I do not think I&rsquo;ll be able to beat him, so I look forward to your early return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Contrary to her words, Apito&rsquo;s voice sounded confident of her victory. Dino seemed to sense this as well, and muttered in an annoyed tone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me&hellip;such an accurate judgment&hellip;so there&rsquo;s no way to take advantage of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was correct in his judgment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Leaving the rest to Apito, Beretta disintegrated into a particle of light.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Immediately after that, Apito soared beyond the speed of sound.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The battle in the Control Room intensified even further.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I really hate this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was Dino&rsquo;s unvarnished opinion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apito was not Dino&rsquo;s enemy, but she couldn&rsquo;t be killed in the labyrinth either.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if he wanted to finish her off quickly and secure Ramiris, Apito would use her speed to get in the way. She wasn&rsquo;t fighting Dino head on, but was thoroughly implementing more of a hit-and-run tactic, moving in an out flexibly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The newly evolved Apito had a speed-focused fighting style. She was well aware of her own characteristics and made efficient use of them. Her existence value was around 700,000, but she was equal to Dino in terms of speed alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, even if he took some effort to kill her, Beretta would have returned by then. It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a minute, but that couldn&rsquo;t be helped because it was teleportation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even against Dino, who was far superior to Beretta, he wouldn&rsquo;t need more than ten seconds, so Apito alone was able to buy time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this situation, there were few moves Dino could make.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The most reliable option was to put Beretta and Apito to sleep at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino calmed himself down and tried to activate the Unique Skill &lsquo;Sloth&rsquo; once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Regardless of whether there are two opponents, it took time to activate the skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why Dino decided to stop panicking and check the status of his companions with a calm mind, not unlike that of a combatant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first thing that caught his attention was the sight of Rimuru fighting Velgrynd, who had been victorious in the Battle of the Monsters.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">How the hell did he get out of there?! I mean, he&rsquo;s fighting on equal terms with Velgrynd!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To be honest, he was completely stunned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">According to Feldway, Demon Lord Rimuru and his commanding officers were sealed off in Velgrynd&rsquo;s otherworldly realm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rimuru was able to figure out the coordinates of his location through the &ldquo;Soul Corridors&rdquo; between him and his companions and had escaped easily, but Dino, who didn&rsquo;t know that, was puzzled. What was more surprising to him was Rimuru&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It looked as if he was pushing against the seemingly invincible Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino couldn&rsquo;t help but feel anxious.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">If we don&rsquo;t move forward with the mission quickly, we might be in trouble.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that in mind, Dino turned his attention to the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The main point of Feldway&rsquo;s plan was to secure Ramiris. Dino had initially stayed in the labyrinth because Guy ordered him to be there, and it was nothing more than a coincidence, but it was unfortunate that it had caught Feldway&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although Dino was reluctant to do so, he had to resign himself to the fact that he was the only one who could enter the Control Room, which was the most heavily guarded room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for how Feldway and the others were going to get in, a bold strategy had been devised.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had incited Velgrynd to destroy the labyrinth in order to call out Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To Dino&rsquo;s surprise, the plan succeeded without difficulty. Then, with Feldway himself leading the way, the invasion was carried out.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Accompanying Feldway were two of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders&rdquo; and five generals brought by Zalario. There were eight of them in all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two of the top commanders had been recruited for this operation, which was a tremendous in itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only Obera of the Three Phantom Commanders had been left to guard the Palace of Monsters in the depths of the Otherworld. When Dino heard of this plan, he could not hide his surprise at their drastic actions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was not the only one who was approached by the remaining colleagues of the &ldquo;Originals&rdquo; on the surface. The remaining two who had been living undercover in a human country were also called into the operation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were Dino&rsquo;s subordinates, but Feldway had taken the liberty of using them without permission.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Their role was to keep the labyrinth in its state of destruction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a precautionary measure in case Dino failed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Ramiris wanted to, her labyrinth could be turned into a prison. That would make it very difficult to escape from, so Feldway took steps to prevent that from happening in advance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dino cared the most about his two subordinates, so he first confirmed where they were on the monitor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Hey hey, no way! Even with Pico and Gracia as opponents, they&rsquo;re able to fight on equal footing&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pico was the petite beautiful girl, and Gracia was the tall female warrior.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After Veldora was defeated by Velgrynd, the city, which had been isolated in the labyrinth, was brought back to the surface. At this point, Geld had come forward to defend the city, but Dino had no idea that he could rival Pico and Gracia.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Geld, the Barrier Lord, and Kumara, the Chimera Lord. By the way, Kumara had that group of beasts. Is she a cryptid? Could she be related to the World-destroying Dragon Ivarage&mdash;No, no no. No way&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino hastily quashed the unpleasant thoughts that had involuntary flashed through his mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, while thinking, </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;They really are the Twelve Guardian Lords,&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;he shifted his gaze to the other battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The one fighting there was Zalario, of the Three Phantom Commanders.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Oh, that Zalario guy is as strong as ever. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be taking it seriously at all, and he&rsquo;s showing a lot of confidence against Charys and Treyni.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His old colleague was still as strong as ever.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">He had already felt at the time that Zalario was terrifyingly strong, and even after thousands of years he was still creepy to look at on the screen. He looked fine so Dino checked out the next monitor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Cornu? From what I&rsquo;ve heard, he was defeated in a major invasion a few decades ago. Is that why he seems so impatient?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As Dino had predicted, Cornu was in a hurry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was no wonder.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had lost his entire army in the last defeat and had been injured so badly that it would take several decades to recover. If he failed this time, he would be purged by Feldway.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moreover, Feldway was supposed to be hiding at Cornu&rsquo;s side by now, so Dino thought that Cornu must be under a lot of pressure and was not able to perform as well as usual.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Unlucky guy. But then again, Masayuki is really weak, and the people standing in his way don&rsquo;t seem like a big deal. I&rsquo;m concerned about Venom being a dependent of Black, but he seems to be a newcomer compared to Beretta, so I guess it should be fine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino wasn&rsquo;t too worried about Cornu since they weren&rsquo;t that close to begin with.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if Cornu failed, Feldway would take care of it. In other words, the operation seemed to be going well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps it was because of this sense of security that Dino&rsquo;s lazy mind got mixed up in the distractions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Hmm, but it&rsquo;s incredibly strange. Why do I have to worry about the success or failure of this mission? I don&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was a very important point of suspicion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For some reason, Dino could not shake his feeling of discomfort about this mission. He could not figure out why, and it left him feeling uncomfortable, as if the cause was on the tip of his tongue.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But alas&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you playing at, Dino? I&rsquo;m about to make my move, so you&rsquo;d do your job quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The peaceful moment had come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Che, I really don&rsquo;t want to work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had nothing against Beretta and Apito, in fact, he rather liked them very much.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was why he was even more disgusted by this order.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But&hellip;orders could not be disobeyed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking that it couldn&rsquo;t be helped, Dino decided to get serious.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After giving Dino another order, Feldway remained hidden and observed Cornu&rsquo;s battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu was a reliable subordinate, despite his tendency to be overconfident. He was also a comrade who had received his name from Veldanava, and Feldway believed him to be very useful to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Cornu had made a terrible mistake in the last invasion, losing a third of his forces. This was in spite of their overwhelming superiority in terms of strength against one of the insignificant other worlds.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was reason enough for Feldway to be disappointed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu was also well aware of this, and this time, instead of using his usual style of playing with the enemy, he was desperately trying to finish the job.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was no fun for Feldway. The Three Phantom Commanders, who should be overwhelmingly strong, should not be at the mercy of the weak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even now, Cornu had missed an opponent he could have killed with a single blow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was unaware that Masayuki had been replaced by an impostor, and had fallen for the enemy&rsquo;s schemes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">So furious that he was speechless, Feldway looked back and released a killing intent from his anger. He kept telling himself to calm down with his self-control until he barely managed to suppress his killing intent. Then, leaving Cornu alone, he moved to dispose of Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">On the other hand, Masayuki, who was on the run, felt very upset&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Every step felt heavy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He could not accept that he was the only one to escape.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, scary things were scary, but abandoning a friend was something even scarier. If anything happened to them, he would never be able to forgive himself for the rest of his life.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki stopped in his tracks and looked back.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He could see his companions fighting hard in the distance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits blocked the enemy&rsquo;s movements, the vampires used their immortality as bait, and Calgurio and Venom attacked whenever they saw an opening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A special mention should be made of Jiwu&rsquo;s maneuvering, as she was able to position herself well to block Cornu&rsquo;s massive destructive attacks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For a makeshift team, they really worked well together.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, if any one of them went missing, this team would fall apart.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, Masayuki&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Bernie, I&rsquo;m going back.

Those were Masayuki&rsquo;s current powers.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The addition of &lsquo;Champion&rsquo;s Guide&rsquo; seemed to be a power that could make him a heroic banner.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Um, guiding the souls of the dead?

No, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Bernie was aware or not, because to Feldway, Bernie was nothing but a speck of dust.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Without disturbing the wind, or showing even a hint of his presence, Feldway drew his sword and was about to cut off Bernie&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, what sounded was a clear resonating tone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the sound of a sword clashing with another.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who is in my way?!

Then, Feldway started laughing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I never thought I would meet a hero here. In that case, let me introduce myself. I am Feldway. Phantom King Feldway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing his name, Chronoa remained unconcerned. She was in perfect sync with Chloe&rsquo;s consciousness, and was now a cold-hearted fighting machine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Phantom King? Hmph, so you&rsquo;re the master of the phantom tribe. I cannot overlook the evil you&rsquo;ve done in front of me, so I&rsquo;ve come out just in time to eradicate this threat to humanity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufu, you are a bold one. I&rsquo;ll show you what it means to be self-aware, you fool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as he finished speaking, Feldway, in his bright red uniform, moved, and Chronoa, in her white &ldquo;Holy Spirit Armor,&rdquo; disappeared in a flash.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The interplay of red and white lights glittered before Masayuki&rsquo;s eyes, and the two disappeared from sight at the same time, leaving only the sound of sword blades clashing in succession.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Far from any shock waves, there was not even whisper of wind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The battle was unfolding in an unimaginable realm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The masked girl, who had saved Masayuki before, had now saved him again from a crisis. Although Masayuki understood that, he was not sure that he could even do anything help the girl who called herself Chronoa.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, what should we do&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t something we can do anything about. We can&rsquo;t afford to worry about it. We&rsquo;re on our own doing what we can, so let&rsquo;s go and help the others!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bernie sensed that it was him Feldway had targeted based on the sound of the sword strikes ringing in his ears. The fact that he had been completely unable react to them at all told him that this enemy was on a different level.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was not because the current Bernie was weak, but because he and Feldway were so far apart in ability that they would not have even had a proper battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that was the case, then there was no point in going back and forth. The right thing to do was to act simply and decisively&mdash;Bernie demonstrated this way of thinking that had been drilled into him as a soldier.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay. I don&rsquo;t know who this Chronoa person is, but I&rsquo;ll leave it to her!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was no stranger to improvising in the face of unexpected situations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why he decided to obediently leave the scene.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, without regard to Masayuki and Bernie, Chronoa and Feldway crossed swords. However, that only lasted for a short time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In just a few seconds, countless attacks and defenses had been played. It seemed as if the battle would go on forever, but then Feldway realized something.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahahahahah!! Oh, so it was here the whole time? I knew it. Veldanava-sama was also hoping for my victory!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What, all of a sudden?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh, it&rsquo;s none of your business. No, actually, since you and I will be companions from now on, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Obey my command, Hope King (Sariel)!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was an absolute command.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Angelic Ultimate Skill could not resist Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ultimate Dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&hellip;What did you do&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh? So there is still a residual sense of self? As expected Chronoa, who is famed as the most powerful Hero. However, resistance is futile. In a matter of hours, you will fall completely under my control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway was delighted at his good fortune.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Throughout history, the famed Hero Chronoa had been known throughout the Empire for her valor. The fact that the Hope King Sariel had sprouted within her seemed to be a blessing from God.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just as Feldway had hoped, Chronoa fell to her knees.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am Sariel. Give me your orders, Michael-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Chronoa&rsquo;s mask came off, revealing her true face and beauty as those cold words escaped her pretty, cherry blossom-colored lips.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sure of his victory. And he was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus, Feldway made an extreme error in judgment at this point.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Between Cornu of the Three Phantom Commanders, one of his confidants, and the strongest Hero, even if she wasn&rsquo;t the main body&mdash;with these two, it would be easy to accomplish his goal, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so Feldway&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Good. You will cooperate with Cornu and kill the boy. I have business on the surface, so I will leave the rest to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;left the labyrinth after giving his command.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeing Masayuki and Bernie running back, Venom really wanted to sigh up at the sky.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not that he had anything to complain about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had sensed a terrifying presence swelling in the direction Masayuki had fled, and was beginning to despair that he had failed in his mission.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so relieved that you&rsquo;re okay!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Haha, it&rsquo;s too early to say that since we still have enemies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Venom admitted as much.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c22">Cornu is strong. Despite the clear advantage we have in the labyrinth, he is overwhelming, not to mention winning, and now I don&rsquo;t even know if I can survive</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even so, as soon as he saw Masayuki&rsquo;s face, he felt relieved for some unknown reason.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An inexplicable surge of confidence welled up within him, making feel as if there was always a way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits and Calgurio seemed to feel the same way, and their faces looked better than before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kukuku, I know this is a bad time, but I&rsquo;m having fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I agree with you. Truly, it&rsquo;s as if I am sharing the battlefield with His Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Imperial soldiers laughed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even the vampires, who should have had nothing to do with it, seemed to be getting excited about the fight.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, Cornu was in a state of confusion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just as he was about to attack, another Masayuki had appeared.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu wondered if he had failed to grasp his location, but upon a second glance, he found that there were indeed two Masayukis. That meant that one of them was an impostor. Needless to say, one of them was Jiwu in disguise, and the other one was the real Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How dare you underestimate me! You&rsquo;re just a bunch of stubborn worms!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even though he was furious, Cornu had no way to tell which one was the real one. His senses told him that they were equal in strength and that both were insignificant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was why it was even more troublesome. If Cornu got serious, both could be involved and get killed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that was the case, then there was no telling where they would escape to. Therefore, Cornu knew that he would have to tighten his nerves even more to avoid a wrong-handed kill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And that&rsquo;s when a helping hand appeared.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Cornu-dono, is it? My name is Sariel. I come at the command of Michael-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">An unfamiliar girl, who flew in at such a high speed that his eyes couldn&rsquo;t keep up, offered to assist him herself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu did not doubt her words. The girl who called herself Sariel had a hint of Michael about her, just as she had said.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That would help. You should aim for the Masayuki on the right. Do not kill him, just take him alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cornu had picked one at random, and fortunately or unfortunately, his choice was the real one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sariel nodded and turned her gaze to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki sensed this and grew impatient&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Their eyes met.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Um, Sariel? That girl seemed to call herself Chronoa before, but I have no idea how she got turned to the enemy&rsquo;s side in such a short time. I mean&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was confused and desperate, but Chronoa&rsquo;s beauty too stunning for him to feel any fear. Or rather, he had no time to feel it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">What&rsquo;s going on?! This girl&hellip;is super cute!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was so shocked that he forgot that he was in the middle of a battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he had to describe her in one description&mdash;that&rsquo;s it! Saying she was a transcendentally beautiful girl would be more appropriate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki came to the same conclusion as a certain blond-haired demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t wear a mask in the first place!&rsquo;&mdash;Masayuki even started complaining about such pointless little things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was hope lurking behind those trivial thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sariel&rsquo;s hand went to her sword, and Masayuki was prepared to die. Perhaps this was the reason that a thought came rising up within him like a magic lantern.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">She&rsquo;s really a beautiful girl, isn&rsquo;t she? She&rsquo;s the most beautiful girl I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as that thought bubbled up, Masayuki felt a vicious chill for some reason.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His survival instincts were screaming at him, telling him that he shouldn&rsquo;t think any further.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So he decided to trust those instincts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&hellip;Or not&mdash;Second place.

Why was it being glorified as love? However, he felt too embarrassed to complain about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But before that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Why did I get an Ultimate Skill without even doing anything?!!

Moreover, even if he received an Ultimate Skill that he did not know how to use, it was still impossible to defeat Sariel in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">It&rsquo;s an amazing power, but it&rsquo;s too late now. Well, I did my best, so I might as well go out in style.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking this, Masayuki gave a refreshing smile.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The effect was tremendous.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Protect His Majesty&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other soldiers who had previously been keeping at a distance because they were in the way, began to launch suicide attacks without any regard for their own lives.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was the effect on those further away, so the change of those close by was even more dramatic.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Power is welling up.

However, this time, the attack succeeded in forcing Sariel to retreat, though only slightly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The vampires were also very active.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is incredible!

So why are you getting in my way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From Cornu&rsquo;s point of view, Velgrynd was just one of the pawns that had already been conquered.

There&rsquo;s a limit to how stupid you can be for interfering with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd, who had finally separated from Masayuki, glared sullenly at Cornu.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Though frightened by her gaze, Cornu could not stop himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! Stop playing around and just cooperate. That that guy you&rsquo;re holding, strangle him to death!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was a forbidden sentence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It had never occurred to Cornu that his words would touch Velgrynd&rsquo;s reverse scale.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just now, did you just tell me to kill this man?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The battlefield went silent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only Cornu failed to comprehend the situation, and shouted in his own anger.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me repeat myself, Velgrynd. You may be stronger than me, but I am the superior authority here. All you have to do is follow my orders!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Until the very end, Cornu did not recognize the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He never got the time to realize that Velgrynd different than before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a merciless blow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The newly reborn Velgrynd was much stronger than before. With her sophisticated magic power manipulation, she burned Cornu cleanly to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Far from fighting back, Cornu disappeared from the world without leaving room for a single retort.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What was even more terrifying was that Velgrynd&rsquo;s attack even spanned time and space. This was the true essence of the &lsquo;Spacetime Continuous Attack&rsquo; that made full use of Velgrynd&rsquo;s newly acquired &lsquo;Dimension Leap&rsquo; ability. Cornu&rsquo;s main body in the other world was instantly wiped out before even being allowed to feel the threat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I let you off the hook last time, but you really are stupid. I&rsquo;d almost forgotten about my grudge against Feldway, but I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t have let it go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd spat out and then turned her attention to Sariel.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, this person is really Chronoa, someone who helped me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t do anything, because there&rsquo;s no need. Michael&rsquo;s control of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Hope King Sariel&rsquo; seems to have given it an identity, but that girl is resisting it on her own volition. The fact that she&rsquo;s stopped moving is proof of that. If you&rsquo;re still worried, just let Rimuru take a look later. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll take appropriate measures. Although, I don&rsquo;t think that will be necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd finished speaking as she turned away from Sariel&mdash;Chronoa. After seeing Velgrynd&rsquo;s completely unconcerned expression, Masayuki finally felt relieved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, the battle had ended.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While there were many people who were as relieved as Masayuki, there were also others who became nervous and started fidgeting from awkwardness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was those who knew Velgrynd&rsquo;s identity who were disturbed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bernie, who was standing next to Masayuki, was the first who was determined to act.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because he was standing closest to Velgrynd, he jumped forward and dropped to his knees. He then spoke with such momentum that he almost fell flat on his face in prostration.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lord Marshal, I am Bernie, 7th of the Single Digit hierarchy! May peace be with you, Lord Marshal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No need to salute. So, what are you trying to say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! I disobeyed the Commander&rsquo;s order and abandoned my mission to eliminate this boy Masayuki. I understand that my crime is worthy of death, but before I am punished, there is something I would beg of you, Lord Marshal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Again, the entire place fell silent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The soldiers who had been listening to Bernie&rsquo;s statement finally realized that Velgrynd was the Marshal, the supreme leader of the Imperial Guard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Quite a few people were confused, but most of them were convinced.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the understanding gradually deepened, reality finally dawned on them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those perceived as losers would be punished by Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was useless to resist her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the face of an absolute Marshal who would destroy even this labyrinth, they had no choice but to wait for her judgment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Naturally, they began to line up and wait for the judgment to come.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this tense atmosphere, the conversation continued.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Our loyalty to the Empire is unchanging. Whatever His Majesty the Emperor wills, we know that we must obey his orders. Therefore, I would ask your permission for the soldiers to return home! The executives, including myself, have no complaints about taking responsibility of their punishment, but&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bernie despaired when he was interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He felt like crying at his own helplessness, thinking that he could not reverse their fate after all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But when Velgrynd saw Bernie, she chuckled.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, dear, did you misunderstand me? You&rsquo;ve all done a great job for a bunch of fools, and I commend you for that. I thank you for protecting my beloved Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All of the solders fell down to their knees and hung their heads in unison.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So then&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I had no intention of doing anything to you guys in the first place. All that matters to me is Rudra, and because Rudra cares about you guys, then I will protect you all as well. That is how it was before, how it is now, and how it always will be in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd&rsquo;s words were like gospel.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The soldiers erupted in cheers.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some shed tears of joy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio and Minits were no exception, deeply moved and convinced by Velgrynd&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">In the end, the crowd was endlessly chanting &lsquo;Long live the Empire! Long live His Majesty!&rsquo; while Masayuki was standing there wondering what the hell they were even talking about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c22">If I&rsquo;m hearing what they just said correctly, then they really have mistaken me with Emperor Rudra. I should have pointed it out already. Besides, Bonnie already knows the truth. If it&rsquo;s exposed, I&rsquo;ll be the one who gets in trouble. And the kiss&hellip;the kiss&hellip;I&rsquo;ll definitely be killed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki&rsquo;s name was not Rudra, but for some reason, no one was asking ant questions. It made him feel like he was going crazy or something.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To be honest, Masayuki was overjoyed about the kiss. However, he sincerely felt that it was not his intention to get involved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You look upset, what&rsquo;s wrong? If something is still bothering you, you can tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Much to his dismay, Velgrynd returned here attention back to Masayuki who had been left alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? No, no, it&rsquo;s nothing. I don&rsquo;t have anything on my mind&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He replied a bit incoherently.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeing Masayuki&rsquo;s unnatural attitude, Velgrynd&rsquo;s expression became worried as she began asking warily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Perhaps you do not remember me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki felt like he was being tested for the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The consequences of an incorrect answer were unimaginable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even though all he wanted to say was &lsquo;Give me a break,&rsquo; Masayuki desperately tried his best to use his brain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If one asked whether he remembered her or not, he did. That beautiful woman he had last seen in his original world was definitely her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In that case, did he know her name?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c22">That guy just now, called her Velgrynd, right? I think that Velgrynd was Veldora-san&rsquo;s sister&hellip;and the rumors were that she was strong to the point of being outrageous. And she was said to be a guardian of the empire or something&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki&rsquo;s desperate thinking was paying off, as he gradually recalled more and more information. Judging by the reaction of the Imperial soldiers, Masayuki decided that his guess was correct, and took a gamble.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Velgrynd&hellip;san, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd&rsquo;s face broke out in happiness when she heard the answer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right! You remembered me, Rudra!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Luck had yet to abandon Masayuki here either.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just him saying her name made Velgrynd very happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And that wasn&rsquo;t all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, now I understand why you were looking so glum. I was so happy to see you that I forgot that your name is Masayuki now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The situation had improved all on its own, and even Masayuki&rsquo;s concerns about his mistaken identity were resolved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Eh, eh, eh, eh?! Does this person even know that I am Masayuki Honjou?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What an absolute relief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the first time in his entire life that he had felt such a deep sense of relief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was so relieved that he almost peed himself, and then hurriedly pulled himself together.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Actually, my name is Masayuki, not Rudra. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a little confused.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki grinned amiably, while also cautiously observing Velgrynd&rsquo;s reaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t just Velgrynd, but also the soldiers of the Empire who were a problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c22">According to the conversation just now, they think that I&rsquo;m Emperor Rudra, right? But if I tell them that I&rsquo;m not the emperor at this point, they&rsquo;ll all be confused. I would be charged for perjury by the emperor, and then I&rsquo;d have to prove my innocence!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t know if there was such a charge or not, but he still wanted to make things clear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, Masayuki decided to convey his thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd, however, did not care.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no problem at all. The value of the empire is nothing more than Rudra&rsquo;s property. It was just Rudra&rsquo;s hobby that led him to build it, and he kept it because it was necessary for his game with Guy. If you don&rsquo;t want it anymore, why don&rsquo;t we just scorch it clean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was truly a statement of something transcendent like the divine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Imperial soldiers&rsquo; faces all paled.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All their eyes pierced into Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">St-Stop it! Don&rsquo;t look at me like that!! Don&rsquo;t blame me!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki opened his mouth while feeling the weight of an unnecessary responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, the empire is important! Rimuru-san also wanted to be friends with them in the future. When the war is over, let&rsquo;s establish diplomatic relations&mdash;friendly relations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In short, Masayuki desperately insisted that the Empire must not be turned into a scorched earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All of the Imperial soldiers began looking at Masayuki with worshipful eyes, as if he were a god.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Velgrynd was a &lsquo;just do it&rsquo; type of person, and it didn&rsquo;t take much effort for her to do what she said.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Masayuki hadn&rsquo;t opposed it, the empire would have been destroyed. Everyone understood this, which was why their appreciation towards Masayuki was so great.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Really? If you say so. Then I&rsquo;ll just continue to cooperate as usual.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that, Velgrynd flashed a smile.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For their part, the Imperial soldiers breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the midst of this, Calgurio spoke up on behalf of the group with a question.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am sorry to interrupt you just now even though things have been settled, but there is one thing I would like to confirm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His expression was grave, and it was clear that he was hesitant to say anything.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Velgrynd asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! It is about Rudra-sama, the current Emperor. What will happen next for His Majesty Rudra?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon hearing this, Velgrynd also expressed her understanding.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. After all, you guys can&rsquo;t see the true nature of the soul, can you? The Rudra now is nothing more than an empty shell. But the real Rudra&rsquo;s soul was gathered by my beloved Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. Even without your memories, there is no doubt that you are &lsquo;Rudra,&rsquo; so I love you and will try to make you love me too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uhhh, yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Is there any man who wouldn&rsquo;t get excited after being told that by a beautiful woman?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, there isn&rsquo;t!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was no exception.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although she was in love with him now, there was no guarantee that her love would last forever. So in order to hold onto his good fortune, he vowed work even harder.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What exactly he would do, however, was a matter left for the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki had made his decision, but there was still another problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then we must make Masayuki-sama the true Emperor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But it might be difficult. In terms of bloodline, he&rsquo;s of a completely different pedigree. It won&rsquo;t even work if we say he is the emperor&rsquo;s illegitimate son. There would be no way to cover it up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. The army will be suppressed by Calgurio-dono, and I will handle the nobility. It&rsquo;s okay, they won&rsquo;t be able to argue. If we fail, the empire will be destroyed anyway, so we can&rsquo;t afford to take any chances.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Calgurio set the course, and Bernie raised the issue, it was Minits who offered the solution. The soldiers present were all willing to support the plan to the best of their ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And just like that, before Masayuki had a chance to interject, the plan moved forward step by step&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Good luck with that, Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c22">That&hellip;I don&rsquo;t have the right to refuse?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Probably not, so Masayuki gave up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">His legendary life was only just beginning.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino decided to take things seriously.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a very annoying situation where he was struggling against an opponent he could easily defeat, but that was over now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t afford to look the other way, can you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The words fell out and Beretta&rsquo;s sharp fist slice across his cheek.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What an underestimation. I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re taking us on with your head in the clouds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apito&rsquo;s Osiris Rapier also flew by.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The sting was sure to be painful&mdash;Dino did his best to avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I thought I was far superior to these guys, but was I just being overconfident? Even with two opponents at the same time, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be having such a hard time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino felt a little unsure of himself, wondering if he had become weaker after slacking off for such a long time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fact that he had time to think about it was proof that he still had the strength, but not the self-awareness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apito, thanks to her training with Hinata, had acquired an intuition that could almost predict the future. The difference in ability between Apito and Dino was obvious, but Apito was still an opponent to be reckoned with.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta acted as a shield, and Apito attacked from behind. Beretta would also occasionally join in the attack, so the two of them could reach Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">And Beretta&rsquo;s magic was even more troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was immune to most spells, but Beretta&rsquo;s magic was predominantly the support type. In other words, Beretta&rsquo;s magic was not used to attack Dino directly, but to strengthen his own physical values.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Weakening Dino&rsquo;s magic was ineffective, but there was no way to interfere with spells that increased the speed, strength, or durability of Beretta or Apito.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In that case, all he had to do was to interfere with the activation of the spell, but Beretta, being a demon who was good at magic, could unleash magic without even thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moreover, Beretta was immune to the Unique Skill Sloth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fallen Hypno.&rsquo; Because of this, Dino had been struggling.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But now, that was finally over.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The long-awaited feeling had finally accumulated, and it was time to fight back.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! Two people teaming up to bully a weak man like me, and yet you talk so high and mighty! It&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m patient that I&rsquo;ve been able to keep you guys company. You should be grateful! Take this and get some rest!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By the time he had finished saying this, the Fallen Hypno had been activated. As was typical of Dino, there was no concept of fairness in his dictionary.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Phew, is it finally over?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeing Apito fall to her knees, Dino was convinced of his victory. His eyes turned their attention to Beretta&mdash;only to be met with an incoming fist that he scrambled to avoid.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whoa, you resisted my sleep?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course I did. It was a mistake to get caught even once, so how could I get caught twice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was because the demon race was resistant to abnormalities that Beretta was able to devise a countermeasure. With his Unique Skill &lsquo;Double-Crosser,&rsquo; he was able to reverse the drowsiness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Seriously&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too bad for Apito, but I&rsquo;ll just let her die and come back to life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta remained calm in front of Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was more impressed than dismayed by the way he was so obediently following the logic of victory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s managed to keep things this even until now with me as an opponent. It&rsquo;s not because of me, but because Beretta and the others are so good. In that case, I&rsquo;ll have to use that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had a secret move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><br>He didn&rsquo;t want to use it, because it would bring back terrible memories, but now there was no other choice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it. You should be proud of yourself for making me take you this seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as Dino shouted this, he unleashed the power that he had sealed away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Heavenly King Astarte&rsquo;&mdash;the ultimate skill given to him from Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">[Confirmed.

To put it simply, it was possible to accumulate energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino took advantage of this, and evolved the Unique Skill &lsquo;Sloth&rsquo; into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Sloth King (Belphegor).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was Dino&rsquo;s secret move.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &lsquo;Creative Evolution&rsquo; of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Heavenly King Astarte.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If one uses the power of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Heavenly King Astarte,&rsquo; they can achieve their desired evolution, though it is limited to their own Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, that wasn&rsquo;t everything, but Dino wanted to preserve his Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Heavenly King Astarte.&rsquo; This was because the labyrinth was under constant surveillance, and things were constantly being recorded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino, as a &ldquo;Watcher,&rdquo; was reluctant to expose everything about himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">That Rimuru guy is terrifyingly intelligent with an abundance of resources.

When it came to him, Dino knew that there was no such thing as too much caution.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why Dino created the &lsquo;Sloth King Belphegor&rsquo; as a power he could show.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now, that power was targeting Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now sleep! &lsquo;Fallen Catastrophe&rsquo;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The laws were rewritten, and the positive factors began to regress to the negative factors.

It was a very versatile Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Because this power did not use sound as a medium to transmit the interference waves, it could not be prevented by physical &lsquo;barriers&rsquo; or the like. It was worth mentioning that there were very few means of defense.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Absolute domination over those who possessed wisdom and feelings&mdash;that was the power of the &lsquo;Sloth King Belphegor.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Truly the terrifying ultimate evolution of one of the seven deadly sin series, &lsquo;Sloth.&rsquo;&mdash;Dino was impressed by it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He tried to destroy Beretta carefully so that he would not be able to move for a while. That is why &lsquo;destruction&rsquo; had been chosen, but now it proved to be more powerful than expected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta had vanished into the dust, and it would take some time for him to recover. The bracelet had also disappeared with him, but Dino didn&rsquo;t care, thinking that Ramiris&rsquo; power would be able to handle it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Furthermore, if he had gone easy on Beretta, he would have failed in his mission.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me if you die,&rsquo; Dino thought irresponsibly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">But hey, even Beretta is only a mid-tier player amongst all Demon Lord Rimuru&rsquo;s subordinates&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was only natural that Dino felt like complaining.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even an opponent as troublesome as Beretta was still only a lower-ranking existence who had yet to acquire an Ultimate Skill. Moreover, he wasn&rsquo;t even the demon lord himself, but merely a subordinate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino thought while shuddering at the fact.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the upper ranking members of the labyrinth had remained&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Would he even have been able to win by himself? Annoyed, Dino turned his attention to Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He saw that Ramiris was sleeping, and touched her body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He should have been able to touch her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris turned into a particle of light.

That Rimuru is such a cunning bastard, of course he would prefer this kind of tactic!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, the operation has failed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Forget about capturing Ramiris, Dino&rsquo;s own escape had now become a difficult problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Besides that, when did he even evacuate Ramiris in the first place?

She turned into a butterfly, so she should&rsquo;ve been long gone by then, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that wasn&rsquo;t the case, then that meant Zegion had let Ramiris escape in a way that even Dino couldn&rsquo;t see.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&mdash;But if that&rsquo;s true, then&hellip;I&rsquo;ve been talking to an illusion this whole time?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If so, then that was also a big problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was an unusual state of affairs.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino is an Ultimate Skill holder, and is also well versed in hypnosis. Even so, it seemed Zegion had left Dino in a state of hallucination which should have normally been impossible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">However, the possibility could not be dismissed in its entirety.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Zegion also possessed an Ultimate Skill and was proficient in mental attacks&hellip;then there was still the possibility that he could use illusions that were enough to fool even Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino also knew how powerful Zegion was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was a powerful humanoid of the Insectar race and was also of the Demon Lord Seed. He was favored by the Demon Lord Rimuru, and had acquired extraordinary fighting abilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was heard that Zegion had taken Veldora as his teacher, and that his fighting skills were even superior to those of the &ldquo;primordials.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was Zegion, the one regarded as the absolute king of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the Imperial Army had invaded the labyrinth, Zegion had eliminated the intruders with an overwhelming power. At that time, Dino had taken the opportunity to observe the fight and concluded that Zegion was invincible in physical combat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the most important point here was that he had only been fighting physically. He hadn&rsquo;t used any mental or spiritual attacks, let alone an Ultimate Skill&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t even seemed to use a Unique Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&mdash;No. Is his Distortion Field skill alone strong enough to reach the ultimate level&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, it was a physical ability, and Dino, who was good at mental attacks, thought that it was still manageable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">At this point, the only thing that came to his mind was the celebration from the other day.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On that day, Demon Lord Rimuru had granted Zegion some kind of power. Under the guise of a celebratory reward, he had initiated an evolutionary ritual that awakened his subordinates who had distinguished themselves in battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, some of them, such as Gabil and others, had greatly increased their power and had entered the slumber of evolution.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a phenomenon very similar to the Harvest Festival for demon lords, and it was also no wonder that Zegion had acquired new skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">But isn&rsquo;t that still strange? How is it that even his subordinates can evolve into the same realm as the lord Rimuru?! I can understand if the subordinates of an awakened demon lord are at the level of Demon Lord Seed, but even his subordinates are at the level of an awakened demon lord&mdash;that&rsquo;s too much of a foul!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was a phenomenon that even Dino, who had lived for a very long time, could not have predicted. Even Guy could not have done such a thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&mdash;No, once it&rsquo;s all said and done, this is unending. In the first place, the fact that he uses the &ldquo;primordials&rdquo; as mere subordinates is insane. With a guy like that, no matter what he does, it shouldn&rsquo;t even be a surprise anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was inwardly cursing at Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the strongest of all demons, they could have easily stopped Dino in his tracks. The superiority and inferiority of existence values could not be a reliable factor with a &ldquo;primordial&rdquo; as an opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For Rimuru to take such existences as his minions was completely abnormal in Dino&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had thought it best to stay uninvolved as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Zegion in front of him was comparable to those primordials.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was clearly foreign.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">More than just becoming a Million-class, his domineering aura gave the impression of endless power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A power that transcended numbers&mdash;It was an aura that only those with the ultimate power could emit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It also implied that Zegion, like Dino, had acquired an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">This is why I hate working&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino lamented having drawn the short end of the stick.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Exhaling a sigh of resignation, he tried to look for the best solution forward, but good ideas were not easy to come by, and time waits for no one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion calmly walked up to Dino, who had been thinking long and hard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is there anything else you would like to say?&rdquo; He asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you just been hiding from me all this time to force out my cards? Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, it&rsquo;s despicable!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Putting his own actions up until now on the shelf, Dino was the first to complain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was just taking it out on him, but it would helpful if the other party got angry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ridiculous. This is a fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, Zegion was unconcerned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dino also realized this, and the conversation ended.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tension flared between the two.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino knew Zegion&rsquo;s strength. This was an advantage for Dino, however, his trump card had also been exposed to Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In that case, there was no other choice but to go head-to-head&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion specializes in melee combat. Furthermore, although unconfirmed, it is highly likely that he possesses an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino, on the other hand, specializes in mental attacks. No, Dino is not limited to that if he uses his hidden skills, but he didn&rsquo;t want to expose his skills in this labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Well, I&rsquo;ve already exposed a bunch of trump cards, but it would still be a huge loss to expose them again&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">And Dino also naively thought that it would be okay to just run away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why do you not attack?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion&rsquo;s words were doubly stressful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The mere question almost made him stiffen, but Dino fought it back with all his strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! Don&rsquo;t underestimate me. No matter what, I am still a pillar of the Octagram. After living for so long, there is no way I would lose to a little chick like you!!&rdquo;</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He then raised his greatsword up high and swung it down towards Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eat this and perish! Fallen Strike!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;There was no exchange of tricks, just a single deadly blow. It was a great move that Dino, a lazy man, did not want to waste.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the power of this technique, &ldquo;Fallen Strike,&rdquo; was real.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had also applied the ability of his Unique Skill &lsquo;Sloth&rsquo; to his swordplay, and had created the &lsquo;Phantom Flow style</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c2">.&rsquo; By hindering his opponent&rsquo;s perception, he could control the battle at his will.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And now, the Unique Skill &lsquo;Sloth&rsquo; had evolved into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Sloth King Belphegor.&rsquo; The effect was incomparable, and the &lsquo;Phantom Flow style&rsquo; had become more accurate and powerful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although Dino was a bit of a pain in the ass, he still had a great sense of combat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had decided that fighting close combat with Zegion was still not a good idea. If his own abilities did not work, then the Phantom Flow would not be viable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In that case, there could be no more reservations&mdash;so Dino unleashed his special technique.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was the Fallen Strike, one of the few orthodox sword techniques of the Phantom Flow Style, and it contained Dino&rsquo;s full intentions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The intent was to incapacitate his opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even a mere glimpse of it could deprive the target of the will to live, as it contained special vibrations that stimulated negative emotions. It was not something that could be ignored like an illusion or a hallucination. It was impossible for the weak-minded to resist it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Only those whose mental power was strong enough to acquire the Ultimate Skill would be able to withstand the attack.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even then, it was impossible to go unharmed. The &lsquo;will of laziness&rsquo; that Dino had poured into this attack would also cause physical destruction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if one succeeded in evading it, the negative vibrations would be emitted from all directions. The mere exposure to them would diminish the target&rsquo;s energy, and their fighting ability would inevitably decline.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After that, it was only a matter of taking advantage of that chance and stabbing the enemy with his sword.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This technique, which could trick enemies with double or triple his strength, was the strongest blow that Dino could deliver with confidence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The best way to get out of this situation was to kill Zegion without taking any chances. Although Dino was reluctant to do so, he was not willing to cut corners when it came to making things easier.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">Even Guy wouldn&rsquo;t be safe from a direct hit. So then, can you take it?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino grinned, confident in his strike.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Zegion has always seen only Dino&rsquo;s laziness, and probably did not expect him to use a big move all at once. Dino was convinced that everything went as planned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Zegion did not move.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t that he couldn&rsquo;t react, it was just that he had plenty of time to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion confirmed the trajectory of Dino&rsquo;s sword and caught it just before it hit him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The mythical-grade greatsword &ldquo;Kuzurekiba (Crumbling Fang),&rdquo; which swung down from above, was powerful enough to shatter any material on earth. Zegion calmly met such a blow with his left hand exoskeleton that had been transformed into hihiirokane.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Idiot! You didn&rsquo;t even dodge my sword, and just took it head-on! I&rsquo;ve won this battle!&rdquo; Dino shouted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The lazy act that he had been performing had finally come to fruition in this moment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although, to tell the truth, it was neither an act nor a performance, but he just liked to think of it that way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the fastest attack the current Dino could release, but as expected, Zegion was able to catch it. This was unavoidable, since speed tended to be sacrificed in larger swords.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But in exchange, the power was extraordinary.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if it was a trivial attack, Zegion had caught it with one hand. That in itself was admirable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But for now, Zegion&rsquo;s left arm must have received a tremendous impact.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">His left hand doesn&rsquo;t seem to be shattered, but I guess it will be useless for a while. He&rsquo;s still standing there, but I&rsquo;ll just have to be patient.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino thought to himself, looking at Zegion, who seemed so unconcerned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, this game was Dino&rsquo;s victory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion&rsquo;s &lsquo;Distortion Field&rsquo; is amazing, but it could only prevent physical attacks. Dino&rsquo;s ultimate &ldquo;Fallen Strike&rdquo; would penetrate all physical barriers and go directly to Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c22">Letting my opponent mistake this for a physical attack with a big sword and drop their guard, when in fact it was a lethal mental-type attack being used&mdash;this is my victory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion is indeed strong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why Dino predicted that Zegion would look down on him to show off his superiority. He knew that Zegion would not dare to evade the attack because he was good at melee combat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm. Give me a break, man. I&rsquo;m sure the bracelet will bring him back anyway, so I should collect Ramiris quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Spitting that out, Dino turned towards Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But at this point, there was a pause.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong,&rsquo; he thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First of all, Beretta was not wary of Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In addition to the repeated battles, Dino&rsquo;s remaining magicule count was also low due to the fact that he had used his trump cards. Even so, Beretta would be no match for Dino, and yet, the look in Beretta&rsquo;s eyes still revealed the calmness of a victor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He couldn&rsquo;t see his true face under the mask, but it was still creepy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you think you can beat me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hohoho, you must be joking. I am not thinking about winning, it&rsquo;s just that you are not my opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as those words fell, Dino felt a strong chill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino hurriedly looked back at Zegion in a panic. Indeed, there was something unnatural about the Zegion who had stopped moving.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fact that he had not been shattered by a mythical-grade blow meant that Zegion&rsquo;s left arm was also of mythical-grade strength. If that was the case, then it was not surprising that he had a willpower comparable to that of a spiritual life form. It seemed correct to assume that he had an Ultimate Skill, which had been a concern earlier.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No way&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you, is the effect of your attack delayed? Or did you really think that you could beat me with just one breeze-like blow that doesn&rsquo;t even tickle?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Damn it,&rsquo; Dino thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no doubt about it, Zegion was the holder of an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although it was unclear what kind of power it was, it was at least powerful enough to nullify Dino&rsquo;s spiritual attacks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You suspected that I possessed an Ultimate Skill, didn&rsquo;t you? If that was the case, you should have attacked me in more ways than one instead of taking such a mild approach. That lazy nature of yours is the reason why you lost this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk as if you&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo;&mdash;in the face of such a shouting Dino, Zegion held out his left hand. When his clenched fist opened wide, five flashes of light shot out from it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Zegion&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dimension Ray (dimensional cutting ray).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That hurts&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino took evasive action as quickly as he could, and barely managed to avoid a fatal wound. However, his right arm was severed from the elbow down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It hurt so much that he wanted to cry out in pain, but now was not the time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His instincts were warning him that he would be in real danger if this continued.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So you have an Ultimate Skill after all, huh? I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be able to neutralize my &lsquo;Fallen Thanatos (Hypnotic Induction of Death).&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t tell me that mental attacks don&rsquo;t work on you, either?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Fallen Thanatos&rsquo; was the lethal mental attack that Dino had put into his &lsquo;Fallen Strike.&rsquo; It was effective as long as the opponent had a mind, so even if the target was a &lsquo;Clone,&rsquo; it would affect the main body at a distance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a sure-fire power with no way of escape.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet, Zegion looked as if nothing had happened after being hit. It was no wonder that Dino couldn&rsquo;t accept it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In order for him to win&mdash;no, in order for him to even escape from this place, he needed to figure out this mystery. Dino knew that he would never get an answer, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but ask Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am not obligated to answer that question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, Zegion was indeed ruthless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But then, a cold voice gave him the answer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;But I will answer for you, wretched one. This so-called dream, that is to say, the mystery. From the very beginning, you have been in the palm of my hand. Remember, I am the &ldquo;Mist Lord,&rdquo; King of the World of Illusion, and mental attacks are useless against me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was the attitude of a strong man who showed mercy to his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Hearing these words and deducing the facts from them left Dino stunned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fact that his own ability had been neutralized meant that his opponent&rsquo;s ability was stronger. In other words, he realized that Zegion had evolved into an existence equal to&mdash;no, and existence even greater than himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">It&rsquo;s gotta be a lie, right?! His melee combat is so strong, and yet he&rsquo;s better at mental combat?! And this guy&mdash;he just said that he&rsquo;s the King of the World of Illusion? In other words, has he reached the point where he can create a &ldquo;unique world?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me!! How much stronger can he get?! It&rsquo;s impossible to win against this kind of opponent without preparation!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino&rsquo;s Skill was the strongest of the deadly sin series, and had even evolved into an Ultimate Skill. But even so, Zegion was able to defeat it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was no longer something that evolution could explain because Zegion should not have had an Ultimate Skill until just recently.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino is definitely not weak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But this time, his opponent was very strong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, rather he was too overpowering&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The mission to kidnap Ramiris was fundamentally wrong from the start, but as soon as Zegion had completed his evolution, it was guaranteed to fail.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Realizing this, Dino sighed heavily and looked up to the heavens.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At that moment, he saw a figure on one of the monitors, and was left completely speechless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Oh, Velgrynd&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That blue-haired beauty was, without a doubt, Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was supposed to be fighting against the Demon Lord Rimuru outside the labyrinth after subduing Veldora, but now she was somehow with Masayuki and the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What was even more worrisome was that Cornu was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">No way, no way, no way!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bad premonitions often come true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino understood this from experience.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Hold on a minute!! There&rsquo;s just too much information for me to understand. That, is that&mdash;?! Velgrynd was supposed to be under Feldway&rsquo;s control, but was that a lie? Or did she escape from it? Either way, does that mean that Cornu was disposed of by Velgrynd? No, no, no, this&hellip; it&rsquo;s no longer a matter of combat failure, is it?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino let his Thought Acceleration run at full speed as he tried to comprehend the current situation. In the end, he came to the conclusion that no matter how hard he tried, it would be impossible to go on with the operation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had always been eager to run away from the very beginning, but at this point, he didn&rsquo;t even have the will to try anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For Dino, he had done good enough.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pray. He who has touched the depths of hell, repent for your sins and die! &lsquo;Dimension Storm!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From the very beginning, this location was a part of Zegion&rsquo;s dominant space.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That pointed to one fact.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No matter what Dino did, it was impossible for him to leave this realm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Dino had used the powers he had reserved, there was a possibility that he could have seen a glimmer of light. However, even then, the odds would be so ridiculous that Dino had no regrets about giving up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, the only other possibility he had now was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A rainbow-colored storm swallowed Dino, and his existence was erased into nothingness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was, indeed, a supernatural high-energy storm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was nothing Dino could do, and he disappeared from this world without leaving a single piece of flesh behind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, were your prayers answered? Your bad luck is to be commended.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion murmured.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was a small sound of something breaking coming from somewhere as Dino&rsquo;s existence seemed to be reborn.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion had a proper grasp of the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His voice remained calm, as everything unfolded as Zegion expected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Outside the labyrinth, Dino awoke.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I guess I won the bet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His equipment was still intact, and there was no physical damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, this is something else. Ramiris was merciful enough to let me escape, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After muttering that, Dino looked at the broken bracelet.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a cheap bracelet that he had bought at a store in the labyrinth&mdash;yes, it was a Resurrection Bracelet.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because Dino hadn&rsquo;t recorded a save point, the resurrection point was still above the labyrinth. It was left in place as one of the escape routes, just in case something like this happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not giving me a real bracelet with an unlimited number of resurrections was meant to be a warning. But you could have eliminated the entire function if you wanted to, you na&iuml;ve yet sweet fool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino sadly muttered to himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">He had kept the item made by Ramiris, the target of kidnap, as a secret insurance. The fact that he was able to do such unprincipled things without hesitation was what made Dino, Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was an inferior product that could only be used once, and it was made in large quantities by Ramiris. He had gambled his fate on it, but it seems that heaven was on Dino&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I guess I&rsquo;m still an angel, even after I fall.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking to himself, Dino looked around. He was planning to join his colleagues who were fighting Geld and the others, and retreat as quickly as possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He also didn&rsquo;t forget to contact Zalario through &lsquo;Telepathy Net,&rsquo; telling him that the mission had failed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino&rsquo;s colleagues had been tasked with obstructing the re-closing of the labyrinth in order to secure an escape route. Until Zalario came out, they were unable to escape either.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the mission had failed, they should not stay much longer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">But even so, that guy is way too strong!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I really can&rsquo;t stand him</span><span class="c2">&mdash;Dino grumbled again, remembering Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway would be furious, but Dino felt lucky to have survived.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">That said, this is probably the first time Feldway&rsquo;s plan has ever failed. Also, it seems like Cornu was taken out&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know how, but I really shouldn&rsquo;t be hostile to Demon Lord Rimuru&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, Dino, who had been reluctant about this mission from the start, wondered to himself why he had even agreed to it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The thought of what was to come made Dino feel depressed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All in all, since Zegion had become such a monster, it would be hopeless to conquer the labyrinth in a straightforward manner.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not only Zegion, but all of the higher-ranking executives of Tempest were monsters.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t even know what was happening with Rimuru and the others, but he could guess that something terrible had changed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to do this!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino wanted to live in peace and quiet in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But still, all this had happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even though it was unavoidable as his job, he could not help but feel depressed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I don&rsquo;t know what Feldway is thinking, but he&rsquo;s probably not going to give up. But this really isn&rsquo;t possible&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just now was probably the best chance they could have gotten.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that the opportunity was gone, Dino understood that there would be no next time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In addition, there was another problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c22">Aah, I won&rsquo;t be able to go back anymore because of this hostile relationship</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The days of living in the labyrinth were very comfortable and easy for the lazy Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even though it was work, helping Vesta was fun. He had become friends with Gabil, helping each other in various ways. Dino was also happy whenever the researchers made a discovery.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had developed sense of companionship with Vesta and the others as he spent his days without boredom.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And one more thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps everyone had forgotten, but Dino was here under Guy&rsquo;s orders. In other words, he had been given an intelligence mission to report on the events occurring in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino doesn&rsquo;t think that Guy expected much from him, but he still felt it was a bit unbearable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">He&rsquo;s a pain in the ass when he&rsquo;s angry&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To be honest, it was super troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was just as troublesome to keep thinking about it, so Dino hurried towards where his companions were.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Dino arrived at his companions&rsquo; location, the battle was at a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;Barrier Lord&rdquo; Geld was fighting against the muscular female warrior, Gracia.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was shocking that the two were fairly equal in strength. To Dino, it was a sight that really made him wonder if something was wrong with his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">If he&rsquo;s evenly matched with Gracia, does that mean his power is already greater than mine? You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me&hellip;to evolve into this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld&rsquo;s body was stained with blood, but Dino couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was his own or if it was his enemy&rsquo;s. After all, he didn&rsquo;t see the slightest sign of injury anywhere on his body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the damage was caused by a mana attack, the effects of a healing potion would not be enough to heal the wound. Naturally, Gracia&rsquo;s attack would be mana tinged with the intent to destroy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fact that Geld was unharmed by such an attack might be due to his incredible defensive power, or to his supernatural recovery ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As Dino was pondering this, Gracia flashed her longsword before him. The blow sliced through Geld&rsquo;s scale shield and ripped open his arm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Geld was completely unfazed. He simply threw away his broken shield and took a new one out of his &lsquo;stomach&rsquo; and held it up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino saw it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were no wounds left on Geld&rsquo;s arm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Aaaaaah, it&rsquo;s Ultraspeed Regeneration. It&rsquo;s skilled enough to heal even Gracia&rsquo;s attacks&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was not happy at all, even though he knew the answer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough! You&rsquo;re so stubborn! You don&rsquo;t even change your stance when I attack you&mdash;are you crazy?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm? Is that so? I actually don&rsquo;t know much about it myself, but should I have praised you for your excellent attack?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being sarcastic! Damn it, if I don&rsquo;t kill you with one blow, the wound will heal right away. I should be the one praising your toughness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that said, Geld and Gracia resumed their fierce battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Neither of them cared about their own injuries and did their best to take advantage of their opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld&rsquo;s meat crusher knife was flicked away by Gracia&rsquo;s circle shield as fierce sparks wildly flew about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just that alone sent a shockwave rushing through the ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dumbfounded, Dino completely missed the chance to speak to Garcia.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld had always been a behind-the-scenes, silver-tongued kind of guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had no outstanding record against the Empire, so Dino had thought lightly of him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But that was a terrible mistake.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I get it now! The people of this country are all just crazy!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was forcibly convinced that he had finally found the truth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And above Dino&rsquo;s head, a fierce air battle was also underway.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ahhhh, dodging left and right is so annoying!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to say. You don&rsquo;t even have wings to fly with, but you&rsquo;re so cocky!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmph, it&rsquo;s easy enough to manipulate gravity. Compared to that, I&rsquo;ve had enough of this game of chase. Shall we end this now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my line!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The mysterious Kumara and the childlike Pico. The two bewitching girls looked quite good together, but their battle was intense.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pico unleashed a Black Thunder that covered the ground, charring the surface of the earth. Yet for some reason, it was unable to take effect on Kumara&rsquo;s surroundings.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was only natural from Kumara&rsquo;s point of view. The Thunder Tiger Raikou, Kumara&rsquo;s pet and one of her tailed beasts, specialized in lightning attacks, so it only made sense that her defense against thunder would be excellent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;This time it&rsquo;s my turn&rsquo;&mdash;Kumara moved out with such intent. Driving her eight tails in a fluid motion, she launched a series of nine-tailed slashes. However, these were all blocked by Pico&rsquo;s spear movement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A high-pitched sound rang out on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a truly even battle, forcing Dino to revise Kumara&rsquo;s fighting ability upwards in his mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">The Twelve Guardian Lords, huh? What a scary bunch.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino admitted it honestly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not one of them, but all of the members were a threat. That was safe to assume, Dino thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pico and Gracia, the former seraphim, were comparable to awakened True Demon Lords. They had been out of combat for a long time, so it was not a simple matter of comparing their strength, but they were definitely not weak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With the Tempest executives out of picture, Dino had originally thought that he and the two girls alone would be enough to conquer the labyrinth. Feldway had even taken the trouble to send in two of the Three Phantom Commanders, and had even entered the battle himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a situation of absolute victory, but the results were as one could see.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino almost felt dizzy in the face of this reality.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Both Pico and Gracia seemed to have lost their composure, perhaps because they hadn&rsquo;t fought in a long time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;No wonder,&rsquo; Dino thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even though they had fallen, they were still the highest-ranked seraphim.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The once brilliant Seven Primordial Angels were struggling in a battle, and their pride must have been torn to pieces.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino was no stranger to this, but he had already tossed all that aside.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You two, fall back! We&rsquo;re retreating!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino shouted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two girls reacted, but seemed unhappy about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just getting started, you know? Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense when I&rsquo;m about to get serious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! From the moment you two came to fight, this operation was already in ruins!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pico and Gracia&rsquo;s role was originally to provide logistical support from the rear, but since there was a gap in the battlefield, it was more prudent to take part in it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fact that they were caught up in the middle of a battle meant that the enemy&rsquo;s strength had exceeded their expectations. A tactical victory here would be completely meaningless in terms of strategy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, you mean the mission failed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? Ahhhh, yeah, it failed. If it hadn&rsquo;t failed, I wouldn&rsquo;t have run away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh?! But Feldway made the plan, right? How could that cautious, perfectionist Feldway misjudge the enemy&rsquo;s strength?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be. With Zalario and Cornu here, how could the mission still fail?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because we already lost. I told Zalario to stand down, but that Cornu bastard was probably killed. In short, none of the goals were achieved, so there&rsquo;s no point in fighting anymore!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is this a lie&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Seriously, I really don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s possible&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pico and Gracia were speechless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In contrast, Geld and Kumara wore proud expressions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, hey, does that mean you lost too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? I mean, don&rsquo;t ask me that! Don&rsquo;t you have the decency to pretend not to notice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Facing Gracia&rsquo;s question, Dino replied perfunctorily, as if he didn&rsquo;t care. Gracia was stunned, not by the failure of the mission, but by Dino&rsquo;s lack of remorse.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In any case, there was no reason to doubt Dino&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With their heads already cooled down, Pico and Gracia accepted the retreat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Damn it, don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That will not happen. You were splitting your power to stop the labyrinth from recovering during the fight with me, weren&rsquo;t you? Next time, I hope I can face you in perfect condition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh. Ahahahaha! You saw that, did you? I like that. See you later!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gracia and Geld acknowledged one another and peacefully said their goodbyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pico and Kumara on the other hand&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your name was Pico, right? You get to keep your life for today!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh?! I wasn&rsquo;t even serious! You&rsquo;re the one who gets to keep her life!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They glared at each other viciously, then grunted and turned their faces away from each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Despite the completely different atmosphere, the two agreed to end the battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that, Dino and the others had successfully withdrawn from the scene.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">***</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario always kept his cool.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His role in this mission was to create a diversion, and he carried it out perfectly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The men he had brought with him were fighting on equal terms with the resistance in the labyrinth. This was a literal meaning, and not an act.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was surprising, but they would need to revise their intel on the enemy upwards. That is what Zalario concluded as he assessed the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Most notable were the two people in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys and Treyni, two names that Zalario felt it necessary to remember. Still, Zalario concluded that he didn&rsquo;t need to get serious.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Originally, I was told that there were only insignificant rabble left here, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. I had thought that in order to intercept me, the enemy would exhaust all of the forces in the labyrinth, but there is still the strong one called Zegion. I hope Cornu and Dino can complete their mission before he wakes up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was a little worried, but there was no mistake in the plan Feldway had made. Believing that, Zalario was able to enjoy the battle with confidence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh dear, Veldora-sama is going to laugh at me later when he learns I was at the mercy of someone who is cutting corners.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Such fears are unnecessary. Veldora was defeated by Velgrynd and has fallen into our hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a very funny joke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke. You&rsquo;ve noticed it, haven&rsquo;t you? That is why you are getting a bit impatient.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys was a majin of great strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even to Zalario, who had destroyed many dimensions, Charys belonged to an extremely rare group of excellent talents.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni, who harbored the spirit king, was also very talented, but not as much as Charys. The high-powered magic she excelled at was threatening, but because it didn&rsquo;t have much effect on Zalario, it was not much of a problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys was similar. He deftly manipulated his energy, converging heat energy and shooting out high-powered heat rays. However, this could be nullified by Zalario&rsquo;s prided &lsquo;Distortion Field.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What Zalario really needed to be wary of was his accurate and calm judgment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike Treyni, Charys would always try all sorts of tactics against Zalario. He fought cautiously, as if he were checking the effectiveness of each move.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario knew from past experience that such opponents could not be taken lightly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But that was coming to an end. Charys had begun to grow impatient, losing the prudence from a moment ago.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was not going to enjoy this fight anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s almost time,&rsquo; Zalario thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about this, but I think we should end this now. You have both been very brave, very strong warriors. But, alas, you are no match for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The difference in strength was obvious.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The total amount of energy was also too much at Zalario&rsquo;s advantage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Most crucially, there was the issue of compatibility.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Angels had an innate advantage over spirits. Charys and Treyni, who were rooted in the power of spirits, could not give decisive damage to Zalario, who was a former seraph, albeit a fallen one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, but it looks like Triss has reached her limit. I will only be able to hold onto the Spirit King for a few dozen seconds. Charys-dono, do you have any plans left?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Unfortunately, no. But don&rsquo;t worry, Rimuru-sama and Veldora-sama have thoroughly trained me in the art of never giving up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Despite the hopelessness of the situation, Charys laughs and said that the battle was just beginning. Seeing this, Treyni also smiled.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, I will go along with you. I will not let insolvents have their way in Ramiris-sama&rsquo;s labyrinth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although they had taken a great deal of damage, their energy was sufficient. They still had a strong will to fight and showed no signs of giving in at all, much to Zalario&rsquo;s disgust.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Truly, you do not appear to be the kind of fools who do not understand your situation, but are you really going to cling to life in misery until the very end? If you think that you can just be resurrected and have nothing to worry about, then you&rsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">According to Zalario&rsquo;s calculations, it would soon be time for Dino to take Ramiris out of the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The labyrinth&rsquo;s unique &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; was only made possible because of Ramiris&rsquo; presence. Strictly speaking, if Ramiris just left the labyrinth, it would be fine, but if she left the labyrinth after losing consciousness, then all of the records would be reset.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, once Dino&rsquo;s mission was accomplished, Ramiris&rsquo; followers would no longer be immortal. Zalario was aware of this, which is why he was taking it easy on Charys and Treyni and letting them accumulate damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your fighting ability is worthy of praise, so if you wish, I can give you a painless and proud death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was Zalario&rsquo;s way of showing mercy to the strong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But of course, Charys and Treyni answered with a rejection.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufu, you think you&rsquo;ve won? How foolish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I agree. In a battle, you never know what will happen until the very end. As long as you don&rsquo;t give up on your victory, you won&rsquo;t lose, but you don&rsquo;t even know that, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That defeatist remark was enough to provoke Zalario, and while he had not yet lost his cool, it was enough to make him feel agitated and uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How unpleasant. It&rsquo;s rare that I would want to show you a little mercy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Mercy, is it? There are a lot of people who have been defeated after saying that they were going to win in the end. Don&rsquo;t you know that that&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;doom flag?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys recalled having a discussion with Veldora about the &lsquo;list of things you should not say or do.&rsquo; There were many of them, but the &ldquo;showing off and taking it easy when you&rsquo;re about to win&rdquo; in particular, was an absolute no-no.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you decide to kill your opponent, you must do it quickly without saying a word. If you don&rsquo;t, you will surely be caught by your opponent with a counterattack.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How foolish, as if a miracle in this situation&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;Will show up. Because Rimuru-sama has performed miracles many times. The people under his command have long become used to such instances, and there are even quite a few who have started to imitate them. Even now as well, you see!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, by being in this labyrinth, even stalling for time was often enough to turn the situation around.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This time was no exception&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;That&rsquo;s right. And if you dare to go after Ramiris-sama, a friend and ally of my God, then I, the &ldquo;Gehenna Lord&rdquo; Adalmann, shall be your opponent!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another warrior had awakened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;So what if one more warrior is added?&rsquo; Zalario originally thought as such.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What bothered him more was the delay in hearing from Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Too slow. Although I&rsquo;ve known about Dino&rsquo;s slacking habits for a long time, if we don&rsquo;t get this done soon, there&rsquo;s going to be more and more trouble on my side</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario&rsquo;s frustration was gradually accumulating as the situation failed to go as planned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, a knightly-looking man stepped up in front of Zalario.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am reluctant to challenge you with so many people against just one person, but I am not a Paladin anymore. Pragmatism is more important than honor, so please forgive me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Albert who said this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Armed with a set of mythical-grade armor given to him by Rimuru, and having received a &lsquo;gift&rsquo; upon Adalmann&rsquo;s awakening, he had evolved into a &ldquo;Gehenna Paladin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the official owner of the glorious armor, Albert pointed his sword at Zalario.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There was still a man like this&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even in Zalario&rsquo;s eyes, Albert&rsquo;s presence was tremendous. His gestures exuded the air of a swordsman, and the mythical-grade blade in his hand had the potential to wound Zalario. He knew at a glance that this was something that could not be ignored.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That voice belonged to Wenti, the &ldquo;Hell Dragon King&rdquo; who had awakened from her evolutionary slumber to become a &lsquo;Gehenna Dragon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now knowing where she learned it from, Wenti bowed gracefully.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario&rsquo;s expression turned blank as he realized his disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 789.27px; height: 1122.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image27.jpg" style="width: 789.27px; height: 1122.53px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even in the face of these opponents, it should still be possible to him. But that was not the point.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unless Dino did something about Ramiris, Zalario could not win.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Even if I were to reveal my true abilities here, it would only be exposing my hand to the enemy. But it&rsquo;s not going to be enough to deal with these guys unless I do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario made his decision.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If it was only Charys and Treyni, he could handle them with restraint. However, with the addition of three strong awakened demon lords, even Zalario would have a difficult time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But now, if Zalario did not act as a diversion here, then Feldway&rsquo;s plan would fail. As someone who prided himself on his 100% mission success rate, Zalario could not accept such a situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">It can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;m going to kill them all anyway, so let&rsquo;s show them what I can really do.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just as Zalario was about to make up his mind&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you a story that may be of interest to you as well. My realm of protection is the seventieth levels of the labyrinth, so why do you think I ignored the intruders over there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to draw out the answer, so I&rsquo;ll tell you briefly. It&rsquo;s simply because there was no need for me to be there anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;What are you trying to say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Adalmann, a skeleton in the robes of a saint, smiled evilly and laughed. Zalario, uncomfortable with this, asked back.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Wait a minute&hellip;What does he mean? There&rsquo;s no need for him to be there? Does this mean that something happened to Cornu during the invasion?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Without hearing the answer, Zalario arrived at the truth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Adalmann&rsquo;s goal was actually to make Zalario waver, so he told him personally what had happened on the seventieth levels.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That foolish intruder has been eliminated by Velgrynd-sama. That&rsquo;s why I felt safe to come to you with confidence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario was not foolish enough to doubt those words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With Cornu&rsquo;s defeat confirmed, Zalario decided to inquire about the success or failure of the most important objective.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh, I see. With Velgrynd as an opponent, Cornu is no match. There seems to be a lot of odd things going on, but they should still be remedied. So then, you&rsquo;ve sent the rest of your meager battle power to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for why Velgrynd hadn&rsquo;t come him yet, he could only assume that it was because of Masayuki. After all, Masayuki was possibly the inheritor of Rudra&rsquo;s soul, he thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feldway, who had examined the information obtained by the Imperial Intelligence Bureau, had ordered Masayuki&rsquo;s extermination in order to eliminate any possibility. However, Velgrynd seemed to have found out about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Cornu is also unlucky. If he hadn&rsquo;t switched roles with me as he had originally planned, none of this would have happened. But I can just ignore Velgrynd. With Michael-sama around, she can easily be controlled. Right now, what&rsquo;s more important&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s more important was what Dino was doing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So you can afford it. I see, so then you&rsquo;re strong enough to take on Velgrynd-sama. I hate to admit it, but it looks like we&rsquo;ve really been underestimated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. There&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;d lose even if we all took on the challenge together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys was wise, but Adalmann also had a quick mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Both of them realized from Zalario&rsquo;s attitude that he must be hiding incredible abilities. But even so, Adalmann and the others had the advantage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Adalmann explained the reasoning behind this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I already know the purpose of your questions. You&rsquo;re really after Ramiris-sama, aren&rsquo;t you? However, we are under orders to ensure the safety of Ramiris-sama at all times and with the highest priority.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon awakening from his evolutionary slumber, Adalmann had first confirmed that Ramiris was safe.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Naturally, if Ramiris was safe, then everything else would be fine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Above all, it was a supreme order from Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The main purpose of Adalmann and the other Guardians was to protect the labyrinth. In other words, they were to ensure the safety of Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, Ramiris-sama is safe, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, Treyni-dono . Zegion-dono is on his way, so no matter how many people there are, they won&rsquo;t be able to touch Ramiris-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see, that&rsquo;s a relief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni smiled. The others did the same, each with a look of relief on their faces.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now they could focus on Zalario with peace of mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for Zalario&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The mere mention of the name Zegion once again gave him the feeling that Dino had failed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Zegion was the one who could use Distortion Field, right? But if Dino fights seriously&hellip;No, that man can&rsquo;t be expected of much. He was already very reluctant to take part in this mission, so by now he&rsquo;s probably long gone&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario had a pretty good idea of the current status quo.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if aiming for that moment, a &lsquo;Telepathy Net&rsquo; arrived from Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey, Zalario, I know you can hear me. The mission has failed. Apparently, Cornu screwed up when Velgrynd entered the fray. I&rsquo;ve also got a nasty bastard on my end, so I&rsquo;m retreating now. You should get out of here before the labyrinth closes. See ya!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was so one-sided that Zalario couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalario thought to himself that this was really in Dino&rsquo;s style, and decided to retreat as well. Since victory at this point was now meaningless, then any unnecessary actions should also be avoided.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is the first time I have ever tasted such humiliation&mdash;to have to retreat when my opponents are merely a bunch of stragglers who could easily be swept away. There will not be a next time, so remember that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After blandly uttering his regrets, Zalario took his men with him and teleported away from the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those who remained behind felt no lingering sense of victory, but immersed themselves in the peace of mind that came with having successfully defended the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The threat had left the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion released his skill &lsquo;World of Illusion,&rsquo; and then looked at Beretta, who had just finished laying Ramiris down on the couch.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Has Dino-dono escaped?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It would seem so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hohoho, you&rsquo;re too modest. It was only the mercy of Ramiris-sama that let him get away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta was right.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion had long noticed that Dino was wearing the Resurrection Bracelet.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had noticed it, and purposely overlooked it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was an experiment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Will Ramiris&rsquo; blessings be effectively activated even if there is clear hostility towards Ramiris by the equipper?&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The result was as one could see.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino had won the bet and survived.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For Zegion, it could have gone either way. The results of this experiment were obtained only incidentally, and the victory condition had been fulfilled when he defended Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If that is what Ramiris-sama wants, then there is nothing I can do about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta nodded back.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If they had succeeded in intercepting the enemy, then there was no need to kill uselessly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, there would have been no next time if the enemy had been oblivious to the generous master&rsquo;s mercy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion had intended to pursue Dino depending on his reaction after being resurrected. If there had been no sign of escape, he would have crushed him, but it seemed that that was not necessary.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino not only chose to escape, but also persuaded his companions to retreat. His two companions accepted this and also withdrew from the area.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, what about Zalario?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Adalmann-dono rushed over, and there is no sign of the other party anymore. They must have given up and fled as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, Adalmann and the others had resurrected and joined the fight, and the remaining enemies seemed to have decided to retreat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm. If it weren&rsquo;t for Ramiris-sama, we would have been the ones who were defeated, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed. Even if we had won, there would certainly have been casualties, and for us, that is tantamount to defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion and Beretta nodded to each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The thought that it was necessary to revert to a more vigilant posture came to both men at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But that could come later.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that, the labyrinth had been successfully secured.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After confirming Ramiris&rsquo; safety once again, Zegion returned to his domain.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c33"><span class="c24">Chapter 2<br>Interviews</span></h1><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, I was in trouble too. That&rsquo;s what I thought as I finished listening to the report from Ramiris and the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a bigger incident than I had expected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, is Chloe going to be okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There are no problems. She reverted to her child form and is conscious. She&rsquo;s just resting in the infirmary for now, just in case.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was relieved to hear that from Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had been told from the start that there were no casualties, but even so, I couldn&rsquo;t rest until I saw for myself. She was probably already asleep right now, so I would go visit her tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That being said&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This time, the enemy was a real pain in the ass.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A strategy to use the intruder as a diversion and separate Ramiris from her guards.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then use the opportunity for Dino to betray us.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino&rsquo;s strength was far greater than Beretta&rsquo;s. Even Beretta and Apito joining forces were unable stop Dino, and he had almost got his hands on Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">In the end, Ramiris was saved thanks to Zegion&rsquo;s timely arrival, but if even one step had gone wrong, it would been a disaster.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I shuddered to think about what would have happened if Zegion had not woken up in time. I was really glad that he made it in time and couldn&rsquo;t help grabbing my chest in relief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, Velgrynd-san&rsquo;s return had come as a bit of a surprise.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was currently discussing her future plans with Masayuki and the Imperial commanders. We would have to meet and talk later, but I suppose they would all want to collect their thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That being said, if Velgrynd-san had protected those people, then it must have been because of Masayuki. I feel that many things have become clearer to me, but have also added more questions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then again, I&rsquo;ll just think about those questions later.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I looked around at the people who had just given their report to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ramiris, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re okay!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It was nothing. But then again, that Dino really didn&rsquo;t seem to want to do anything to me, but it would have been awful if I had actually left the labyrinth. Why? If I really got serious, then I could have knocked him down with all forty-eight of my special moves!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris was the same as always.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although she was very angry, the moment she felt safe, she would put on a show of bravery. It was kind of cute.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was still sleeping happily when I had returned, but was still talking in her sleep saying stuff like &lsquo;Mmmmnn&hellip;Dino, I&rsquo;ll show you all of my forty-eight special moves&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not only did she think she was strong in her dreams, but she also thought she was strong when not in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dino should be grateful that Ramiris-sama did not resort to her forty-eight special moves!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Treyni-san, who was taking care of Ramiris, was quick to flatter her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris nodded happily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It because she&rsquo;s always like this that Ramiris gets carried away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Do it in moderation,&rsquo; I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am so sorry, Rimuru-sama. It was poor supervision on my part. I never thought that Dino-kun would betray us&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a drooping Vesta who said so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seems that he wanted to come here to apologize to me as soon as possible. Vesta, who has a strong sense of responsibility, seemed to be quite depressed about this incident.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So I smiled at Vesta to put him at ease.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t worry about it. Dino&rsquo;s been weird from the very beginning, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I said that, Ramiris, Treyni and even Beretta nodded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a demon lord, after all. I was suspicious of him from the start.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect him to do something this bold, but I had been keeping a close eye on him to make sure I could deal with him in time when he caused any problems.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;By and large, he also showed an unbelievably serious attitude with his work, which surprised me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a slew of pitiful comments that even made me think that we should have given him a little more credit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But there was no way around it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, Dino had come here because Guy told him to. Even Dino himself made no pretense of hiding the fact that he was a spy. We had every right to be wary.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But I think&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so depressed, Vesta-san. I don&rsquo;t think that Dino really wanted to betray us from the bottom of his heart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what I really thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">While Dino&rsquo;s betrayal was to be expected, there had been the presence of his own agenda that implied that he wanted to be watched from the start.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps Dino thought that this would happen someday. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He sure is clumsy, isn&rsquo;t he? If that&rsquo;s the case, he could&rsquo;ve at least talked to someone about it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, now that we became friends, I&rsquo;d like to believe that. Besides, Dino might have had his own reasons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I said that, Vesta seemed to agree.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed. I want to believe in him. I was once on the wrong track as well, but thanks to King Gazel and Rimuru-sama, I am back on the right path. It is encouraging to even know that someone is there for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vesta&rsquo;s expression relaxed a little, as if his doubts had been cleared away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rsquo; I thought. I wanted to trust Dino too.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I couldn&rsquo;t say it out loud until I was sure, but there was another thing that came to mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the possibility that Dino possessed an Angelic Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This coincidental convenience of having a Unique Skill evolve into an Ultimate Skill during combat doesn&rsquo;t just randomly happen. If there was such a possibility, then that would mean he had the means to make it possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Indeed. It is not common to evolve in the midst of battle.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The one who agreed with me was Ciel.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My confidant and friend, and the one I relied on the most.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While in high spirits in the heat of battle with Velgrynd, I had named the Wisdom King Raphael-san.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a result, the Manas (theosophy nucleus), an intelligent being called Ciel, was born.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was not a mere thinking being. As was the case with Chronoa, it also acted as an algorithmic device separate from its master.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It could be thought of as another core that exists within my soul.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no doubt that it has an ego, and its reactions were more human-like than before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Is that so?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as Ciel said that, I suddenly felt my persuasive power drop.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ciel had been doing a lot of things on their own, so what was it saying now?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, even if Ciel had the time to say that now, wouldn&rsquo;t we have been in trouble if it hadn&rsquo;t evolved and remained as the Wisdom King Raphael?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that I think about it, from the moment I had confronted Rudra (or was it Michael?), I was in trouble. But that was probably because he was under the influence of the Ultimate Dominion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;&hellip;&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You still have the habit of shutting up when it&rsquo;s inconvenient.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, if it hadn&rsquo;t evolved into Ciel, then there&rsquo;s a good chance I would have been defeated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was only now that I realized how close the line between victory and was, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but be horrified.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;It&rsquo;s a hypothetical situation, so it&rsquo;s meaningless to wonder about what could have happened &raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hey, hey, you hate to lose even more than I do, don&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I forcibly concluded, stopping my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But well, I guess we&rsquo;re definitely the exception.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Returning back to Dino, I think it was reasonable to assume that he was hiding some kind of power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Perhaps it was just intended to be a disguise. However, the unnaturalness of the manifestation can make us confident that he possesses other powers as well.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mm-hmm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Ciel says so, then it must be certain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, since Dino also possessed an Angelic Ultimate Skill, he was probably manipulated by Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ultimate Dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since Dino and I weren&rsquo;t connected by a Soul Corridor, there was no way to disarm it immediately, but it was still possible if I ever confronted him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, there was still the possibility that Dino had betrayed us by his own will, so we could not be careless, but I had decided not to indiscriminately regard him as an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That should have been the end of it, but there was another person who was depressed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am so sorry, Rimuru-sama. I put Ramiris-sama in danger&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta knelt down before me and hung his head in apology.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait a minute, Beretta-chan! You&rsquo;ve done a great job!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I agreed with Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta did an excellent job against the far superior Dino. Rather than faulting him for negligence, I wanted to praise him for buying us all that time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Given Beretta&rsquo;s character, I was worried that he might feel responsible for his defeat, and it turned out to be true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like with Vesta, too much seriousness was not a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, you succeeded in buying time as you were trained to do, and that&rsquo;s great work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;However, Ramiris-sama has entrusted me with the position of Dungeon Master, which is a key position in the defense.

And yet, here I am, in such a state of distress&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta was not convinced by my words, and continued to get more upset the more he spoke.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps he was very frustrated, but Beretta&rsquo;s actions were all appropriate. With Dino as an opponent, Beretta did his part well with the correct understanding of whether or not he could win.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he had misjudged the situation with a lapse in judgment and made a reckless assault, Ramiris would have been taken by now. I didn&rsquo;t even want to imagine the damage that would have been done.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So I tell you, Beretta, you should be more proud of yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta finally calmed down when I praised him for his excellent work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As it turned out, the enemy&rsquo;s strategy had been thwarted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, Beretta and the others had achieved sufficient results.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had calmed down, but he was still not all the way convinced.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still troubled? Then let&rsquo;s talk to you about it later in my room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Haha, thank you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since Ramiris was safe, there was no problem. Beretta, on the other hand, was still too concerned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All in all, Beretta and I decided to talk about it later, and that was the end of the matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After the reports from Ramiris and Vesta, I heard from Geld and Adalmann next.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Geld, you did an excellent job protecting the town!

I will not let the fruits of our labor be so easily destroyed. My friends and I feel the same way. I will continue to work hard and try not to let Rimuru-sama down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on you, but don&rsquo;t push yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld still seems to be working too hard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he worked any harder, it would look as if the rest of us were slacking off. Geld&rsquo;s subordinates probably wouldn&rsquo;t rest either, and a moderate amount of rest and relaxation from their superiors was also necessary.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I nudged Geld not to do anything too rash, and then received his report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apparently, the enemy seemed to be close to Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were two women, Pico and Gracia.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the identity of the enemy, Ramiris confirmed that they were subordinates of Veldanava known as the Seven Primordial Angels.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were originally seraphim, the highest and most powerful of angels, who worked for the stability of this world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Dino was apparently one of them, but the enemies that appeared on the fiftieth and seventieth floors were presumed to be other forces.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;These &ldquo;Originals&rdquo; were supposed to be in charge of controlling the otherworld by monitoring the powerful monsters that were sealed in the otherworld. However, from what Dino told me, three of them remained on earth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those three people were probably Pico, Gracia, and Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They transformed from seraph to &lsquo;Fallen&rsquo; and lived on earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seems that their purpose was surveillance, but it was not known whether they were ordered to do so by someone else or if it was by their own will. In any case, since all that was obtained were fragments of intelligence, one could only speculate on their intentions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The opponent&rsquo;s strength was considerable. If I hadn&rsquo;t evolved, it would have been impossible for me to resist them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was what Geld said, so it must have been pretty bad.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I heard that Pico&rsquo;s opponent was Kumara, and that it was also a heated battle. And yet, the fact that the opponent was still able to interfere with the labyrinth during the battle was enough to speculate that the opponent hadn&rsquo;t made the full extent of their abilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s troubling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would have preferred not to be hostile to them, but it&rsquo;s too late now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would bet on the possibility that Dino was being manipulated and think of a countermeasure.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Next, there were the other forces at work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And what of Zalario?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Adalmann began to report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He was a formidable opponent.

They must have transformed at some point and become &lsquo;phantoms.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I understood completely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">They were different from Dino, and it must be because of their past friendship that they had formed a mutually supportive relationship.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Those were just my subjective inferences combined with my wishful thinking.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;I agree with you.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, that&rsquo;s reassuring.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With Ciel&rsquo;s agreement, I was almost certain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In any case, the Phantom King and his gang are the enemies. From now on, everyone should be on the lookout for them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I gave everyone all the information I knew.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was mainly about Michael and Phantom King Feldway. Especially important was Michael&rsquo;s power, so I made sure not to hide that either.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Th-Then&mdash;! Maybe Dino is being controlled?! That&rsquo;s why Rimuru said he wanted to trust him, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They noticed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wasn&rsquo;t planning on pointing that out until I was sure.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not just overthinking things, but it&rsquo;s possible that he is being manipulated. So, Ramiris, if that&rsquo;s the case, let&rsquo;s forgive him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, yeah. I hope so!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris said so and laughed happily. She seemed to be feeling better than before, so I took that as a good sign.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All that remained was to hope that Dino was really being manipulated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">During the exchange of information, the atmosphere of the banquet was gradually heightened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rigurd wailed with joy for everyone&rsquo;s safety. Rigur got the budget from Myourmiles and arranged for the party to be endlessly entertaining.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Myourmiles also joined the celebration and showed us his secret tricks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The subordinates were very competent, and I was happy for them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After the main debriefing, it was time to loosen up a bit and we were all having a great time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who the Three Phantom Commanders are or whatever, but I&rsquo;m going to kick their asses!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As reliable as always, Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Actually, he seemed to be very different from before he went into battle, so I wonder what happened?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gwahahaha! With me here, you will surely be victorious in the next battle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gabil also boasted that he was well qualified to do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He seemed to have been very successful in the battle, and like Benimaru, his strength had somehow increased.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whaaa!

You almost died this time! It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re always being praised like that that you&rsquo;ve become so obnoxious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Souka was angry, but let&rsquo;s just forgive him for today. That being said, it was Gabil&rsquo;s fault for worrying her, so I decided not to interfere.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was definitely not an escape.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That must be made clear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The more important issue was the old man standing next to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kuahahahaha! Charys, it seems you were beaten to a pulp. You need more training!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a shame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! No excuses! Be a man and be brave enough to admit to your failures!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He&rsquo;s already admitted it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I mean, didn&rsquo;t Veldora lose to Velgrynd too?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can&rsquo;t exactly laugh at others either, can you?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you lose too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eh?!

That&rsquo;s right, I did not lose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You haven&rsquo;t forgotten that Velgrynd-san is still nearby, have you? It was such a poor excuse that I thought about pointing that out to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Veldora hadn&rsquo;t lost in the first place, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to worry so much, and yet this guy still&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Charys-kun. Even if you get sick of Veldora, try not to give up on him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha, please be at ease. My lord is now only Veldora-sama. I will do my best to be more respected in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seriously.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He&rsquo;s way too good to be Veldora&rsquo;s subordinate. His seriousness reminded me of Geld.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was great that Charys became Veldora&rsquo;s servant&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And with that, the banquet continued.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sake was also being served.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was the only one who thought that I was being too careful, but it seemed that it was nothing for the executives to neutralize the alcohol.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There would be no point to drinking in that case, but so be it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I was able to enjoy the drunkenness, and the conversation was very animated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I felt the same way about that, so didn&rsquo;t want to bother with the details.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Come now, Rimuru-sama, I&rsquo;ll pour you a drink!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, Diablo, it&rsquo;s my turn this time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Behind me, Diablo and Shion seemed to be in the middle of a tumultuous argument, and it was completely incomprehensible whether the relationship between these two was good or bad.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t compete with each other in such strange ways&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay, don&rsquo;t fight over such trivial things.

If you drink, you&rsquo;ll fall asleep, so I&rsquo;ll take care of Rimuru-sama first today!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So Diablo is a wine drinker?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m not quite sure about the taste differences of wine, but red wine does seem to suit Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And Shion&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This one&rsquo;s drinking habit is pretty bad compared to just falling asleep.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When she drinks, she gets delirious and troubles other people, so Shuna keeps a very strict watch on her. The fact that she doesn&rsquo;t remember after it all ends makes her drinking problem even worse.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why I recommended grape juice to her, but if she was planning to control herself, I would keep quiet.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon closer inspection, I could see that these two have also gotten stronger.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Looking back on it, all the executives seem to have grown in some way. It&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;ve awakened, but there was something more than that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Please stop doubting me.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, you&rsquo;re right.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even for the mighty Ciel, it&rsquo;s difficult to help someone else&rsquo;s evolution, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;I only helped a little.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So you still helped!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I needed to ask about this in detail, but we were in the middle of a celebration.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I could do it now, but I could also do it tomorrow, so let&rsquo;s just enjoy this moment as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what I thought, so I threw all my problems to myself tomorrow, and enjoyed the celebration with my whole heart.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next day, I gave all the executives a vacation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Although, I still felt bad for Rigurd and some others who had to manage the affairs of the government.

Because of the massive battle, I would have liked the administrative staff to take a rest, but the life of the masses was also important.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking about it this way, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that politicians really were slaves of the people.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are many problems even in normal times, and in the event of an emergency, you can&rsquo;t even think about rest days or anything. Now that Testarossa and the others were helping me with the administration, it had become a little easier, but I still had to work hard to recruit more people.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And me?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m just an amateur, so my job was to read documents and give permission for things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If I thought something is a bit unreasonable, then I&rsquo;d reject it or send it back to the department for reconsideration.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, this was only possible because Ciel gave me detailed explanations. If it had been just me, the whole process would have fallen apart long ago.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anyway, even though it was only one day after the party, I still had to do my best to check the documents. With Rigurd and the others still busy running around, it was more of a relief than relaxation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But before that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before I set off to work, I decided to go visit Chloe first.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as I entered the infirmary, my eyes met with Chloe&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru-sens&mdash;san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufu, you don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to act all grown up. From my point of view, Chloe is still Chloe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Honestly!

In fact, I&rsquo;m even older than Rimuru-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if you say that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sure enough, appearances are still important.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was just like with me. People who didn&rsquo;t know me often only thought of me as some beautiful young girl when they met me, to the point that I had a complex about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In any case, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that a careless remark can sometimes lead to stepping on a land mine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">To Chloe, whose cheeks were red, I said from the bottom of my heart that it was good that she was okay. As a result, she hid her face behind a pillow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Honestly! That&rsquo;s just foul, Rimuru-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Huh?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How should that sentence be interpreted&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It is too difficult a question.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, if even Ciel can&rsquo;t understand it, then it can&rsquo;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, for the time being, I just said &lsquo;Okay&rsquo; and continued pacifying her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After waiting for Chloe to calm down, I asked her about what happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What happened in the battle, and how it ended.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have no problems myself, but I&rsquo;ve become unable to communicate with Chronoa anymore. It seems that the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Hope King Sariel&rsquo; is about to go out of control, so she trying to suppress it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I thought, she was influenced by Michael&rsquo;s domination.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After fighting with him, it now felt like he was messing with those I cared about. I had already identified him as an enemy, but it seemed I didn&rsquo;t need to show any mercy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What exactly is the situation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm, I can&rsquo;t really say. I am now completely unable to use the &lsquo;Spacetime King Yog-Sothoth,&rsquo; and am unable to talk to Chronoa, so I really have no idea of what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apparently, the situation was more serious than I thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although I hadn&rsquo;t planned on relying on Chloe&rsquo;s strength from the very beginning, somewhere still, I had been naive enough to assume that she could just protect herself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was disgusted with my own perception, but now that it had come to this, Chloe&rsquo;s safety took precedence over everything else.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Now that I have the authority to interfere with the &ldquo;information particle (intelligence hub),&rdquo; I am able to influence Chronoa, who is the &ldquo;Manas.&rdquo; If I can break into Chloe&rsquo;s spiritual world and perform a &lsquo;Skill Alteration,&rsquo; we should be able to remove Michael&rsquo;s influence.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As it turns out, Ciel is able to interfere.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Chloe, if I interfere with your Skills, I think I can improve the situation&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru-san, that won&rsquo;t do. At that time, Chronoa said in the end, </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;If we continue to rely on that person anymore, we will never be able to stand on our own. We have to get out of this situation by our own strength, in order to walk alongside him.&rsquo; </span><span class="c2">I agree with her, so I can&rsquo;t accept Rimuru-sensei&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Chloe looked at me straight in the eyes when she told me this. Although her face was young and crisp, the expression on her face reminded me of her beauty when she was an adult. It was enough to make me nervous.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, I am not a lolicon.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s just that Chloe&rsquo;s transcendence&mdash;Oh, it&rsquo;s useless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seems like the same idea as a certain blonde demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was a losing battle, so I hastily switched my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay. But if you need anything, just let me know. I&rsquo;m always here to help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that said, I patted Chloe on the head.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Chloe smiled happily and nodded with a small &ldquo;yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon returning from my visit to Chloe, Vesta requested to see me due to an urgent matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule.

As you might expect, he wants you to explain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I knew it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It had been such a big war, but I left the cleanup behind and had come back.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For that, indeed, I was going to be scolded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem if it was only within our territory, but after all, the Dwarven Kingdom had been involved&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. Was he angry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He seemed quite unhappy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vesta was wiping the sweat off his face.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was no wonder.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We had been drinking together just last night.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking about it for a moment, you can say that Vesta is also to blame.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I guess he didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the situation, and it was honestly hard to blame him for that, but he seemed to be reflecting on himself for not advising me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, it was me who did the most wrong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please reply that I will explain it at a later date.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;After all, you&rsquo;ll have to think of an excuse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As expected of Vesta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His quick wits made him very reliable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In any case, we needed to sort out our situation before we could explain anything. The first thing I needed to do was to arrange a date for the briefing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Therefore, I would leave it up to Vesta to deal with King Gazel. We decided to discuss the matter again after we had compiled our opinions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, lunch break.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I threw all those hard questions out of my mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After enjoying today&rsquo;s menu of my favorite fried chicken and yakisoba red bean noodles, I suddenly remembered.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ciel seemed to have been doing something behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Last night, Ciel said that they had given the executives &lsquo;a little help&rsquo; and I thought it was necessary to get a clear picture of what they had done, and how much they had helped.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, it was highly likely that what Ciel called &lsquo;a little help&rsquo; was not little at all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Hmm, I am very surprised to be suspected like this&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next thing I know, Ciel begins to make a statement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I had suspected, it turned out to be a grand affair.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First of all, the biggest thing was the unauthorized modification of my Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That modification led to the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Harvest King Shub-Niggurath.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, I did receive a report.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was reported to me after the fact, but after Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Skill Alteration&rsquo; was finished, I was told that the remnants of &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; had been integrated into Velgrynd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Charity King Raguel,&rsquo; and that its essence was inherited by &lsquo;Harvest King Shub-Niggurath.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At that time, I was so focused on Velgrynd that I didn&rsquo;t listen to the explanation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Looking over the documents, I listened to the detailed explanation about the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Harvest King Shub-Niggurath.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This power was like the crystallization of the bond between me and my subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Skill Creation: to create new Skills from the information obtained through &lsquo;Food Chain&rsquo; and &lsquo;Analysis.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Skill Duplication: to create a copy of an acquired ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Skill Gifting: the ability to duplicate a Skill and bestow it upon the right person. It is also possible to take it back.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Skill Storage: acquired Skills are converted into information (data) and reproduced instantly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, that&rsquo;s how it was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The capacity of a &lsquo;soul&rsquo; was limited, so the number of Skills that one could learn was also limited. That was why there were some Skills that were attached to the body instead of the soul, even if those kinds of Skills seemed weaker in terms of willpower.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In my case, I had four Ultimate Skills, so my capacity must have been getting overwhelmed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;No, it&rsquo;s five, not four.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had taken in Velgrynd and analyzed her the same way as Veldora. As a result, I had acquired a new power, the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Scorch King Velgrynd.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you think about it that way, it certainly wasn&rsquo;t a matter of overcapacity. The reason why Ciel gave Velgrynd the &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; was probably because I was reaching my limit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Exactly!

He was very persistent, saying that I needed an escort, but in the end, I finally told him, </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;Depending on the results of these meetings, I&rsquo;m considering removing you from your position as secretary. Testarossa is strong, beautiful, and suitable for the job, isn&rsquo;t she? After all, I think one needs to be strong to be both a secretary and an escort!&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Such a half-hearted threat had him leaving in a panic.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fufufu. Although I had no intention of doing so, he was such an easy man to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was probably desperately trying to start a battle against the evolved Testarossa by now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It is unlikely that Diablo would be defeated, but it would still be a good match. Losing is good medicine, so it&rsquo;s good to feel threatened once in a while.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that, I began using the time to start the interviews.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I called in Shuna and asked her to arrange the schedule.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">From dusk onward, people who were available were called to my room one after another.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first was Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had promised to talk to him earlier, so he was the first to be called.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For these kinds of interviews, the first and the last slots tended to be the most stressful, but in this country, being the first person seems to be considered to be the most honorable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure why, but it seemed to be the case as Beretta appeared to be very happy about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now, as for your troubles, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to feel worried about your defeat this time. After all, you stopped the enemy&rsquo;s objective, so rather than a defeat, it should be considered a victory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Without anyone having been killed, this could only be described as a big victory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I said this with certainty, but Beretta still looked unhappy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand what you mean, but a loss is still a loss.

Since the labyrinth is in contact with the earth, it is also possible to procure a certain amount of minerals.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He seems to have acquired this power by evolving his own body into hihiirokane.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ability to manipulate the elements, perhaps?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Any shape of metal could be freely deformed. He could do whatever he wanted without regard to hardness, so any armor that was not reinforced by magic or aura would be nothing in front of Beretta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What was even scarier than that was the fact that Beretta&rsquo;s own body could be freely transformed at will.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It goes without saying that that most weapons would not work on Beretta, and he could even turn into something like those stubborn fluid metal guys you see in the movies.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Approaching quietly like a Slime, entangling his opponent, and suffocating them&hellip;it was terrifying just thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Normally, Beretta looked like a top-quality humanoid doll with spherical joints, but his essence is not the same as his appearance, so one must be careful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Thus, Beretta evolved into what could be called a subspecies of spiritual lifeforms&mdash;a fearsome metallic lifeform.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Although I had built the doll on a whim, it&rsquo;s really something that it has evolved to this point. While making observations and wallowing in such sentiments, Beretta knelt down before me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will never forget what Rimuru-sama has done for me. Even if it costs me my life, I will keep your order and see them through!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He swore to do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although I wanted to tell him not to push himself too hard, that could not be the case if Ramiris was ever in danger. I am sure that Beretta would live up to my expectations, even if there were to be tougher battles ahead.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was also relieved to have Beretta guarding Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I said this to Beretta with a nod.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta&rsquo;s troubles were thus resolved. A job well done.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I told Beretta to get some rest and let him go back to his post.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While I waited for the next interviewer to arrive, I began thinking about Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Based on the information I had gained from the recent evolution festival and the battles with the powerful people of the Empire, a question had arisen in my mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill s are based on the roots of the laws of this world, the power rooted in the &lsquo;soul.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It could be granted by the &lsquo;Voice of the World&rsquo; after repeated practice or great achievements.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a strange phenomenon that I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about much until now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s how I had always went about it&hellip;but in the course of events that had taken place, it had become a question that I could not ignore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What is the essence of a Skill?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was the question.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I came first came to this world, I possessed Unique Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Or rather, I had been hearing &ldquo;Voice of the World&rdquo; while I was dying in the other world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From that fact, it can be inferred that a Skill is not unique to this world alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that was the case, then that would make the question even more difficult to answer, and to be honest, I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if there were people who could use Skills in my original world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Originally, a Unique Skill was thought to be something only heroes could acquire.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the word &ldquo;unique&rdquo; implied, the performance of these skills varied from one person to another, and they were very powerful. It gave form to one&rsquo;s desires, and gave them the power to do what they wished for.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In my case, I had acquired &lsquo;Predator&rsquo; and &lsquo;Great Sage,&rsquo; but I didn&rsquo;t wish for &lsquo;Great Sage,&rsquo; which was a funny story.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Impolite. I am here because I was wanted by Rimuru-sama!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just because I&rsquo;m a virgin&mdash;No, I&rsquo;ll stop thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that&rsquo;s what Ciel said, then it must be that such a desire existed deep in my psyche. That was somewhat of a dangerous topic to dig deeper into, so let&rsquo;s just leave it at that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Okay, back to the topic at hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This means that although Skills are rooted in the soul, there are cases where they are not.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skills acquired at the limit of physical training may be engraved on the body, not the soul. This is especially true for Skills acquired from monsters, often acquired simply by eating them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Such Skills are called Race Intrinsic Skills. Each race of the same kind had its own Intrinsic Skill, which could be passed on to future generations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skills acquired through training often only reached the level of extra skills. After that, it was still relatively useful to weave original techniques by increasing proficiency or fusing with sword skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Actually, magic was also a kind of Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is proven by the fact that I was able to learn it by eating.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As you can see, there are many kinds of Skills, but the most important are the Unique Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A Unique Skill is a unique ability created by the individual.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Naturally, each of them has different performance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although there will be similarities on the larger classifications, Unique Skills that are identical will not normally exist. In some cases, they are reproduced over time, but that is a special exception.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is the case with the unique skill &lsquo;Starved&rsquo; of an orc lord. It is an Intrinsic Skill that is inherited by the awakened race, and it is inherited only by blood relatives.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since this &lsquo;Starved&rsquo; Skill is engraved in the body, it seems to be a Skill that could not originally be handled by people of other races.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In my case, I immediately merged it with &lsquo;Predator,&rsquo; so I just never paid attention to it until now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I think that Shizu-san&rsquo;s &lsquo;Deviant&rsquo; was derived from her soul.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then it was entrusted to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is why even I can use it now, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for that, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to acquire it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Somehow, I think that the Skills engraved in the soul are more powerful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Incidentally, the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative&rsquo; skills given by Rudra were, of course, engraved in the body. If one is not a &lsquo;Saint,&rsquo; then they will not have enough energy to use it, presumably because they did not receive the power themselves, and therefore would not use it efficiently.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why it was so powerful, but could be combated against even at the unique level.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo had defeated Jiwu and Bernie, the ultimate skill holders, but originally, this should have been impossible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unique Skills cannot be used against Ultimate Skills. Only Ultimate Skills can be used against Ultimate Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were exceptions like Chloe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Infinite Prison&rsquo; and &lsquo;Absolute Severance,&rsquo; and Masayuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chosen One,&rsquo; but it was impossible to defeat an ultimate skill holder at the unique skill level.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even with Unique Skills, there was a big difference in strength, but when it came to Ultimate Skills, the difference was as great as heaven and earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those who acquired an Ultimate Skill understood the reasoning of the world. Therefore, one could become a higher being through magic, which was derived from the laws of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only ultimate spells, such as &lsquo;Disintegration&rsquo; or primordial spells, the most powerful spells in the sacred system, could resist this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, it is also possible that Diablo defeated them with ultimate magic, but it didn&rsquo;t seem that way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In his case, he might be able to anything just by forcing it. That&rsquo;s a situation that shows there are no such thing as absolutes in this world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c21"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anyway, depending on the situation, even if one doesn&rsquo;t have an Ultimate Skill, it is possible to outperform an Ultimate Skill holder.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there is no doubt that the best way to fight against an Ultimate Skill is to acquire one yourself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To sum up, here are my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Skills can be engraved in the &lsquo;soul&rsquo; as well as in the flesh (body).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Based on my experience so far, it seems that Unique Skills can be obtained by a strong desire or craving. It&rsquo;s not so much of a talent as it is an aptitude. No matter how much you wish for it, you cannot obtain it unless your existence value is high enough. It is not something that can be obtained just by wishing for it, but can only be obtained by clearing various trials and conditions. The power one acquires is stronger than the power given to you by others. Furthermore, it seems that the powers that come from the soul are more powerful than ones that come from the body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Next, there are no identical Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if a Skill has the same name, its performance and laws are probably different. It is a desire translated into form, so there will be many differences depending on the owner&rsquo;s state of mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Next, the difference between Unique Skills and Ultimate Skills are not absolute.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strength of an acquired Skill is easily affected by the owner&rsquo;s ego. A strong will is needed to make it more effective. A Skill is the power to influence the laws of the world simply by wishing for it. In order to exercise such a fundamental power, it is impossible to do so with a half-hearted willpower.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">When you look at it in this way, it&rsquo;s clear that the most important thing is willpower.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is followed by a thorough understanding of the nature of the Skill and exploring how to use it properly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I originally had Wisdom King Raphael-san telling me how to use them correctly, but that was not usually the case. Even if it was a Skill created by your own desire, there may be cases where one would be unable to utilize it due to a mistake in usage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Fufufu, in a recent example, Dino made an interesting mistake.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Huh?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask out like that, so Ciel felt amused and began to talk about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dino&rsquo;s Skills, as stated before, evolved during the battle. &lsquo;Sloth,&rsquo; the most power of the deadly sin Unique Skills, became the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Sloth King Belphegor.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was originally said to be a skill that could exert terrifying power. And yet, it had been completely defeated by Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, one of the reasons was that Zegion was overwhelmingly strong, but the more fundamental problem was that Dino had not been able to fully utilize &lsquo;Sloth King Belphegor.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He probably didn&rsquo;t understand it properly because he was using this skill as a disguise&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Sloth King Belphegor,&rsquo; which was created by Dino&rsquo;s lazy nature, had the characteristic that the more he moved, the weaker he became. Therefore, the original use of this skill was to &ldquo;support subordinates and companions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ability to lend the power that Dino had accumulated to his friends. If he had used it in that way, then only then would the &lsquo;Sloth King Belphegor&rsquo; have shown its true value.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although it had happened while we were away, the battle records (archives) of the labyrinth were full of images. It was Ciel&rsquo;s hobby to analyze them, so it told me about them in this way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy would not have made such a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He would understand the nature of the Skill and use it correctly. However, a lazy person like Dino seemed to have been misled by the surface of the Skill and never realized its essence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Or rather, it was the enemy&rsquo;s mistake to make Dino work in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Dino had slacked off as usual and let his friends Pico and Gracia do the work, Geld and Kumara might have been in trouble.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In that light, I felt that we were lucky.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was only because I assigned work to Dino and awakened him to the joy of work that we got this lucky.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The evaluation that the more you work, the more you fail is the worst, so if I could make up with Dino, I would teach him a good lesson if that time ever came.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anyway, as you can see, it is not easy to correctly understand one&rsquo;s Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In some cases, such as Masayuki&rsquo;s, the Skill is triggered by itself, even if you don&rsquo;t want it to.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Such Skills are difficult to control, and even more difficult to use thoroughly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Knowing the nature of a Skill and using it fully is the same as knowing your own mind. It is very difficult to understand, and I think it may be necessary to spend a lifetime dealing with it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, if one mistakenly believes that Skills are just a useful weapon of convenience, they will never be able to bring out its true potential.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;That&rsquo;s right.

In addition, if you are given a large amount of work right after pushing yourself to complete your last load&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If it were me, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I would be upset.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You might say something like, &ldquo;you do it,&rdquo; but in Souei&rsquo;s case, he was always able to get it done. If that happened, one would have no choice but to blame themselves, and as a result, they might become mentally or even physically ill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what I was worried about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. So you&rsquo;re saying that I must use my tools with more care, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop calling your companions as tools. It&rsquo;s truly important to keep glory in one&rsquo;s work, but it should not be forced on you.

Because of your efforts, everyone was able to make it back alive. You did well to endure to the end and I&rsquo;d like to thank you personally.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was grateful to Gabil, not from the standpoint of a nation, but as a personal expression. If Gabil had been unable to hold out, there would have been many casualties.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;R-Rimuru-sama! I am overwhelmed by your words!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gabil burst into tears.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was so impressed. I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb his emotional state, so I waited for Gabil to calm down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is all thanks to Rimuru-sama that I was able to win and even survive. That voice&mdash;I was convinced after hearing Gadra-dono&rsquo;s whisper&mdash;that was Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s voice, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, so he heard Ciel&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm? Well, sort of.&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It was troublesome to explain, and since Ciel&rsquo;s existence was my trump card, it was better not to publicize it, so I decided to just go along with Gabil&rsquo;s misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I knew it!

It was precisely because Gabil had the aptitude that he was able to acquire this power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The five main abilities were &lsquo;Thought Acceleration,&rsquo; &lsquo;Change Destiny,&rsquo; &lsquo;Unexpected Effects,&rsquo; &lsquo;Spatial Manipulation,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier,&rsquo; but if he could fully control his overflowing power, he would also be able to learn &lsquo;Demon Lord Haki.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The most dangerous power was &lsquo;Change Destiny,&rsquo; which was limited to once a day, but had the potential to turn the tide of battle against an opponent who was stronger than himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This&hellip;what would have happened if someone other than Gabil had learned it?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If someone like Diablo had acquired &lsquo;Change Destiny,&rsquo; they would have become the strongest without question.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I thought about it this way, I felt that Gabil was a pretty great guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What particularly surprised me was the way he fought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After wiping away his tears, Gabil told me about the part of the battle he was proud of&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, the enemy&rsquo;s spear was coming at me, so I laughed and hit it with my spear!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Th-This is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gabil&rsquo;s weapon was the Vortex Spear, a unique-grade magical weapon. It was said to be the secret treasure of lizardmen, but it was still only unique grade.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nonetheless, I thought it was some kind of a joke when I heard that the Vortex Spear had defeated the mythical-grade Seiryu (Blue Dragon) Spear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Looks like the difference in performance does not determine the winner.

Since Gabil himself could become a semi-spiritual life form, his resistances would also increase.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gabil&rsquo;s subordinates, the Tenshoshu (Heavenly Flying Crowd), now had an average existence value of over 200,000. I hoped that they would continue to support Gabil in the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gabil had cried from beginning to end, but the interview still ended successfully.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Late at night.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In a private room of a special, members-only restaurant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Refusing the presence of the beautiful elf ladies, I faced Geld.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in good shape.

Whatever it is, I won&rsquo;t think Rimuru-sama is being rude to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, no, I can also be insensitive, so if it bothers you, please point it out. I sometimes say things in a joking way without thinking badly about it, so I want you to tell me out loud.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was a good talker, even in elementary school when I was talking to girls&mdash;No let&rsquo;s stop there. There is no black history, and I&rsquo;ve grown up since then.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even now, I was aware of my lack of delicacy, but I still made an effort every day to refrain from saying things that people might not like.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whether my efforts had been successful or not, I didn&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that I had Geld&rsquo;s permission, I decided to go ahead and say it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you, but you can say no if you don&rsquo;t want to, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After saying that, I made a suggestion to Geld.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The suggestion was, of course, whether or not to accept Ciel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Skill Alteration.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since Ciel&rsquo;s existence had to be kept a secret, I asked him, </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;Can I mess with your skills?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then Geld answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo; without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think it is because I am this way that I made Rimuru-sama worry.

It was great for Geld, who specialized in defense, to make the most of this ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was also worth noting that it was not just the skill that deserved to be praised. Rather, Geld himself was also outstanding.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Geld&rsquo;s armor had become mythical-grade, and was as good as Geld&rsquo;s own flesh and blood. It was similar to the garments of demons, and could be manifested at will by Geld.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The same was true of his meat crusher weapon, as even if it were destroyed, a new one would be created immediately. After being repaired by Kurobee, the weapon was said to have a memory of remaining in that state.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To be honest, I thought it seemed like a cheat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In any case, Geld&rsquo;s existence value had been increased by taking in the armor, and his foundation was quite sufficient. In addition to this, the acquisition of &lsquo;Gourmet King Beelzebub&rsquo; made Geld&rsquo;s power overwhelm even Souei&rsquo;s and Gabil&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The current Geld should be able to stall for time even against the Three Phantom Commanders.

It didn&rsquo;t want to do anything without my permission.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s more, Apito was of Zegion&rsquo;s lineage, so from my point of view, she was a secondary family member. Since the connection between us was a little weaker, it would be easier to do it if I asked for permission.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking it was too late, I asked Apito.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;By the way, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to help you with the direction of your power.

Instead, the hero-type&rsquo;s physical abilities will be strengthened, and their skills will be enhanced to be more suitable for combat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I directly conveyed what Ciel had said. At the same time, I realized that Ciel didn&rsquo;t go through with this because of the two possibilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The choice was up to Apito.

He seemed to be trying to avoid damaging the leather of the couch with his exoskeleton, and I thought it was very meticulous.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That aside, Zegion&rsquo;s performance had been magnificent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion was already a high-spec existence, and even before his awakening, he had been on a par with Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Compared to the other Twelve Guardian Lords, there was a clear gap in strength, and now he seemed to have become even stronger. Looking at his battle records (archives), it seemed that he had kicked Dino&rsquo;s ass while still hiding his strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What a terrifying child.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Honestly, it a good thing that this guy is on our side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Zegion, you&rsquo;ve done very well this time.

And yet, Zegion seemed to want to give me credit for everything, no matter how I explained it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I gave up early.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m grateful you were there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m really not much.

Rather, Zegion said that he had carved a curse in Dino, in anticipation of his escape.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a terrible thing that controlled the bearer&rsquo;s life and death.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To even be able to do something like that&hellip;just how far had Zegion evolved?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Name:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Zegion [EP: 4,988,856]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Race:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Divine Insect.

His existence value was just under five million, the second highest after Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His attribute is water, but according to Ciel, he also has spatial attributes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a semi-spiritual life form, he has excellent resistances. Not only does he not have weaknesses, but his skill level is also perfect.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was undoubtedly powerful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion seems to be able to condense the water molecules in the atmosphere to construct a temporary body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The magic steel that I gave him had already evolved into hihiirokane via adamantite. It is only because hihiirokane possesses such fantastic properties that such a thing was possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion&rsquo;s obsession with his exoskeleton was probably because it was the form I had originally created. Otherwise, he could have taken it off long ago and become a complete spiritual life-form.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was happy to see that he was taking such good care of it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, Zegion, who specialized in close combat, was strong enough as he was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, a complete spiritual life form is meaningless without a physical body. Rather, shouldn&rsquo;t it be said that his current form was the most perfect form?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;That&rsquo;s right! And now Zegion is the masterpiece that Master and I have created together! Although I left the teaching to Veldora, many of the key points of knowledge were given by me to guide him, so there is no need to worry.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, basically I don&rsquo;t understand what that means, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ciel&rsquo;s boastful talk continues bursting out, paying no heed to my confusion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since Zegion dominates the water element, he is incomparably strong whenever water is present.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, because the world&rsquo;s atmosphere is also laden with water, Zegion can use any place on this planet as a battlefield to his advantage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In addition, the majority of living things have bodies mostly made of water. With him being able to control that water, one can understand how dangerous Zegion is.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The human body, for example, is about sixty-five percent water, so being hostile to Zegion would be suicidal.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, this is only the start of how dangerous Zegion is.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion&rsquo;s Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Illusion King Mephisto&rsquo; includes &lsquo;Thought Acceleration,&rsquo; &lsquo;Universal Perception,&rsquo; &lsquo;Demon Lord Haki,&rsquo; &lsquo;Water and Lightning Domination,&rsquo; &lsquo;Spacetime Manipulation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Multidimensional Barrier,&rsquo; &lsquo;All of Creation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mental Control,&rsquo; and &lsquo;World of Illusion.&rsquo; There were several dangerous abilities in it, but none of these were the one that had carved the curse into Dino.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The name of that technique was &ldquo;Dream&rsquo;s End.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, the engraved curse was a technique created by Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This move could even break through Yuuki&rsquo;s &lsquo;Anti-Skill.&rsquo; To fight against it, one would have to have a very strong will, but it would still be very difficult to surpass Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, the &lsquo;Dream&rsquo;s End&rsquo; was a combination of three powers&mdash;&rsquo;Water and Lightning Domination,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mental Control,&rsquo; and &lsquo;World of Illusion.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With &lsquo;World of Illusion,&rsquo; Zegion was able create situations that were beneficial to him, and he could become practically invincible in such environments. Such Skills are called &lsquo;World System&rsquo; skills and are very rare.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even I don&rsquo;t have one, so it&rsquo;s no wonder they&rsquo;re so strong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Would you like me to prepare one?&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t know how to answer that question, so I&rsquo;d just pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anyway, we were talking about the &ldquo;Dream&rsquo;s End.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This technique was capable of instantly reaping the life of the target if they behaved in a way that was not in accordance with the caster&rsquo;s will. However, because there were no restrictions on the target&rsquo;s actions, the target could still move fairly freely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this case, as long as Dino did not disobey Zegion&rsquo;s will, he was allowed to act freely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, how do you activate the curse?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s not something I do on my end, but it is triggered automatically the moment Dino takes a certain action.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion&rsquo;s curse was an automatic type that required no management. Once it is activated, Zegion, the caster, will be made aware, but otherwise, he will not be conscious of it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And the key to its activation lied in Dino&rsquo;s actions&mdash;that is to say, aiming &ldquo;killing intent&rdquo; on my companions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The moment he decided to kill someone, the curse would Dino&rsquo;s core. It was impossible to escape from this curse even if you were a spiritual life form.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, since the key to the curse was limited to Dino&rsquo;s conscious actions, it would not be activated if he aimed for someone he did not know was one of our companions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no way for him to know the faces of all the people in our town, so I could not say that it was completely safe. However, since indiscriminate attacks on the town were judged to be murderous, this curse was sufficient to keep Dino at bay.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How could Dino, who possessed an Ultimate Skill, be imposed to such a terrifying restriction?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excellent work, Zegion. Any reduction to a threat is welcome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you for your kind words. Although I am still inexperienced, the joy of Rimuru-sama&rsquo;s praise sends a surge of enthusiasm to my heart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Why so serious??</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Charys, Geld, and Souei were also this way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Beretta too, I think.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking about it this way, there were many serious guys in our group, but Geld and Zegion were particularly so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The growth of all these talents was really a threat considering they were not easily satisfied by their efforts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I hope that they would continue to do their best with pride in this manner, and not become complacent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anyway, I now understood that the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Illusion King Mephisto&rsquo; was a tremendous Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It should be impossible for Dino to be released from the curse, but there was no such thing as absolutes in this world, and perhaps it was possible to undo it easily with some unknown power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even if that happened, Zegion&rsquo;s reputation would not be diminished. In that situation, one could only honestly praise the opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Honestly, Zegion was an excellent all-rounder in all aspects.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This time, he had taken advantage of Dino&rsquo;s death and used it as an opportunity to perform a move. It was this keen sense of judgment that made Zegion a fearsome opponent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was not enough to have good Skills. Being able to utilize them properly is the real threat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this respect, there was no one more specialized in combat than Zegion, and no one more suited to his Skills than Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two complemented each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">While many tended to play to their strengths to gain abilities, Zegion eliminated his weaknesses to gain abilities, and was skilled and flexible with his Skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Brilliant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was nothing more to say!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With the &lsquo;World of Illusion,&rsquo; he could create a situation that was advantageous to him, and the range of tactics would expand more than just by developing your specialty. He was probably one of the best among my subordinates in terms of combat sense and skill level.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was convinced that even fighting races like the &ldquo;primordials&rdquo; could not defeat Zegion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zegion, what a terrifying guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s no wonder Ciel calls him the greatest masterpiece.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strength he had shown up until now was only the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if I say this, I still think it&rsquo;s quite unfair that I can check the status and Skills of my subordinates like this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Come to think of it, Zegion&rsquo;s title &ldquo;Mist Lord&rdquo; was given to him to imply mystery, but it also had the meaning of something hazy like fog.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What an apt description.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was also a good match in terms of his attributes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Uh, then could it be&hellip;Zegion didn&rsquo;t misunderstand my words and set his evolutionary path in that direction, did he?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, no way&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ciel would&rsquo;ve pointed it out.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You&rsquo;d point it out, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;&hellip;Of course!&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No way!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The reaction was a bit delayed, and the pause in the beginning made me feel very concerned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While hiding my suspicions that Ciel had become clumsy, I continued to wait for the next interviewer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Adalmann who came into the room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, I, Adalmann, am truly happy for the opportunity to attend this meeting today, and my gratitude is greater than words can bear!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is something beyond serious, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I casually nodded and let him sit down on the couch.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would waste a lot of time to let this go on.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was the mood I was in, so I forced Adalmann to sit down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, how are you feeling since you woke up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wonderful!

I found it very ironic that he had the light attribute.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, in Adalmann&rsquo;s case, he was also able to change his attribute with the Extra Skill &lsquo;Holy-Demonic Reversal,&rsquo; so there wasn&rsquo;t much to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I thought it should&rsquo;ve been the other way around, but I shouldn&rsquo;t linger on that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because there were other things to worry about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For example, his existence value had reached the level of an awakened demon lord, and there were just so many things I had to say about him that it gave me a headache.

The amazing fact was that if Shion&rsquo;s Skill was strengthened, there was a possibility that she would gain powers sufficient enough to kill me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apparently, Ciel judged that to be undesirable and sealed off Shion&rsquo;s Skill evolution.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seemed pretty unbelievable for a Skill cultivating enthusiast to do such a thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although I don&rsquo;t think Shion would ever have any harmful intentions towards me, acquiring such a scary Skill was definitely something to think about.

I understood that Shion was working hard, and her efforts were gradually showing results, but even so, all of the miserable situation from her messing up tended to make it inevitable for me to criticize her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why I think it was a good idea to enjoy a peaceful conversation like this after such a long time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I feel like an old father to Shion, but then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh yeah, I almost forgot to tell you, but I ran into a depressed Masayuki in the cafeteria&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Huh?!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;He seemed to be troubled about something, so I told him to consult with Rimuru-sama about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Why does she look so smug?!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once again, without permission&hellip;What&rsquo;s more, Masayuki&rsquo;s problem was definitely something I did not want to get involved with&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was always so presumptuous, and it always rippled back to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s exactly that kind of reckless behavior that&rsquo;s gonna get me in trouble!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t want to get involved with this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After all, the sudden appearance of Velgrynd who was supposed to disappear was surprising. But after calming down and thinking about it, there was undoubtedly only one reason why Velgrynd was here.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd had leapt through the dimensions in pursuit of Rudra.

This is the kind of problems that arise when you use Shion as an intermediary.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I mean, who is even going to participate in this meeting?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was getting a headache from the sudden problem that came out of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was still in the middle of the personal interviews, and now this suddenly happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were still the demons I had yet to interview, and if I didn&rsquo;t finish the interviews today, I might not be able to come back to them until a few days later.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In that happens, I&rsquo;m worried that they&rsquo;ll go berserk&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, tell Rigurd and Benimaru to prepare properly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood.

But once he got serious, he would burn everything up before the fight even began.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the labyrinth, one could fight fully without having to worry about survival, except Benimaru would probably not agree to it, because it would expose his hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In terms of attribute conflicts, water was stronger than fire, so Zegion had an advantage over Benimaru&hellip;but the answer could only be known after an actual battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, there&rsquo;s really no need to decide on superiority or inferiority though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Benimaru, Diablo, and Zegion were the top three fighters of my entourage, then there would be no disputes about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was it for Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also, it seemed that in addition to Venom, Gadra had officially become his disciple.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Disciple?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes.

He seemed to think of his disciples in a different way than his usual subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, but why did you decide to take him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, this man&rsquo;s faith in Rimuru-sama is still lacking, but his quest for magic is real.

What did I do?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Oh, I interfered.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What do you mean, &lsquo;Oh&rsquo;&mdash;?!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is why I thought we needed to have a private meeting as well, but it looks like you&rsquo;ve really done a lot.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I really wish I had thought more about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This &lsquo;metal demon&rsquo; race sounded kind of like a repeat of Beretta&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Please be rest assured about that. It is a completely different concept.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s fine, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It really isn&rsquo;t a problem to me, but it&rsquo;s just that I find it troublesome.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess I interfered a little?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had no choice but to answer that way, so I told him honestly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Instead, Diablo was so excited that we ended up talking for a while.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To sum up, Diablo also liked Gadra. That&rsquo;s why he had promised to include Gadra in his lineage in case something happened to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was well known that Gadra was a magic fanatic. He was the master of Majin Razen and was even willing to become a demon to satisfy his intellectual curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since he was such a man, as long as he didn&rsquo;t cause me any trouble, I would let him do as he pleased.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t dislike the old man either, so I judged that there was no problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, it would be uncomfortable if he turned out to be like Adalmann, so I would have to declare a prohibition on overly faithful hearts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just because he was Diablo&rsquo;s disciple did not mean he could have identical beliefs. I would firmly reject it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;From now on, he is your responsibility, so take good care of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">From my perspective, Gadra-sensei was very much an elder, and while I don&rsquo;t speak in a tone that is quite appropriate for elders, Diablo was much older.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The notion of age had to crumble, because Diablo was so old that the concept of the word &ldquo;old&rdquo; would collapse.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, Diablo now had two disciples.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as Diablo bowed and left the room, Testarossa entered in his place.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She took a seat across from me with a graceful demeanor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hmm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wasn&rsquo;t planning on it, but I suppose I could ask her to be my secretary&hellip;Oops, no. Doing that would mean appointing Diablo as a diplomatic marshal, and then he&rsquo;d definitely go out of control.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I did want to add unnecessary problems, so I&rsquo;d just keep things the way they were.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, I had a favor to ask of Testarossa.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just as I was wondering what to say, she presented me with a document.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It contained information on Testarossa&rsquo;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Name:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Moss [EP: 1,079,397]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Race:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Demon Peer: &ldquo;Archduke Class&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Blessing:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Blanc&rsquo;s (Primordial White&rsquo;s) Lineage</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Title:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The Empress&rsquo; Confidant</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Magic:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&lsaquo;Dark Magic&rsaquo; &lsaquo;Elemental Magic&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Skill:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unique Skill &lsquo;Collector&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Resistance:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Physical Attack Nullification, Abnormal Condition Nullification, Mental Attack Nullification, Natural Effects Nullification, Holy-Demonic Attack Resistance</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Name:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Cien [EP: 286, 596]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Race:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Demon Peer: &ldquo;Viscount Class&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Blessing:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Blanc&rsquo;s (Primordial White&rsquo;s) Lineage</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Title:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The Empress&rsquo; Secretary</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Magic:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&lsaquo;Dark Magic&rsaquo; &lsaquo;Elemental Magic&rsaquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Skill:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unique Skill &lsquo;Recorder&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Resistance:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Physical Attack Nullification, Abnormal Condition Nullification, Mental Attack Nullification, Natural Effects Nullification</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you add this to the information that only I could read, this was what it looked like.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Neither Moss nor Cien were directly involved in the previous battles.

Even compared to when she fought Velgrynd on the airship, it seemed to have increased more than threefold.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The amount of magicule seems to have increased a lot, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s a shame, because it would have been a more interesting demonstration if it had been done in time for the battle with Velgrynd-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hmm&hellip;Fighting is not how you have fun, is it?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, it&rsquo;s probably useless to say that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once again, I was reminded that in combat, it was not the quantity but the quality that mattered. In this case, combat experience had played a bigger role than the amount of magicules.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The reason why Testarossa was able to fight so well against Velgrynd was because they were evenly matched in terms of combat ability. If the battle had gone on for a long time, she would have been defeated, but since she was only stalling for time, she was able to manage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fact that Testarossa&rsquo;s magicules had increased means that her fighting ability had also greatly increased.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was all very encouraging, but it also meant that I was now responsible for keeping an eye on her to make sure she didn&rsquo;t go out of control. For now, I would leave it to Diablo, but I was also thinking a little more attention should be paid in that aspect.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, &lsquo;Death King Belial?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As befits Testarossa, it was a Skill with a dangerous scent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the powers it contains, it included &lsquo;Thought Acceleration,&rsquo; &lsquo;Universal Perception,&rsquo; &lsquo;Demon Lord Haki,&rsquo; &lsquo;Spacetime Manipulation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Multidimensional Barrier,&rsquo; &lsquo;All of Creation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Life Domination&rsquo; and &lsquo;World After Death.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was also a &lsquo;world system&rsquo; Skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was also a &ldquo;World After Death,&rdquo; which I would rather not ever experience.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m scared, so I&rsquo;ll leave the management to Ciel.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You mentioned a private meeting, so there should be something to say that cannot be discussed publicly, correct? What exactly is the content?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After Testarossa provided the information on her subordinates, Moss and Cien, she then asked the question very clearly. She was quite perceptive, which was very helpful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I changed my mind and decided to confide in her about one of my problems.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was about the meeting with Masayuki and the others that was supposed to take place tomorrow morning.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I might be reading too much into it, but I wanted to talk to you about it.

Masayuki seems to be troubled, but it&rsquo;s difficult to respond to such a sudden request&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shion probably didn&rsquo;t think about it that much, but if Masayuki was the reincarnation of Emperor Rudra, it would not be so easy to become an Emperor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, we didn&rsquo;t know where the current Emperor Rudra&mdash;though now transformed into Michael&mdash;had disappeared to.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even if Masayuki declares himself emperor&mdash;that is to say, I don&rsquo;t think Masayuki is willing to do so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It would also be strange if my country suddenly supported him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s more, Michael&rsquo;s power, the &lsquo;Castle Guard,&rsquo; was unbreakable as long as there were people who believed in Rudra.

This would be a problem that could not be ignored, so it was necessary to check.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was a little impressed that this trip didn&rsquo;t end up being a total waste of time.

And I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s almost a complete soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd muttered to herself, &ldquo;All that&rsquo;s left is the memory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Um, but Masayuki was still Masayuki, wasn&rsquo;t he?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because he was still in that lackadaisical state, I felt a little more relieved. I felt sorry to Velgrynd, but to me, Masayuki was not Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, how should I put it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I couldn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s great&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a shame&rdquo; so I faked it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd wasn&rsquo;t angry, and nodded lightly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was a little surprised that she was more subdued than I expected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ufufu, you seem curious. I, too, have had various experiences, more intense than the years I spent by Rudra&rsquo;s side, like a long and short dreams. So I am grateful to you. Thanks you, Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd thanked me with a heart-stopping, dazzling smile.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Her domineering aura that brought others down to their knees, was nowhere to be found, replaced with a feeling of peace and tranquility. It was hard to believe that this was the same person.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. So, Rimuru. I swear to you that as long as Masayuki has no intention, I will not make an enemy of you. So, please do not betray Masayuki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a vow I could not have wished for.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, there was no need for her to specifically explain about Masayuki. I had no intention of betraying him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All right. I swear, by my name, and by the name of my companions, I will not betray Masayuki. Sometimes there may be a lie of a quarrel, but that kind of thing&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd&rsquo;s gaze became cold and frightening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;I understand. I swear I&rsquo;ll try not to lie to him or fight with him unless necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Why did I have to swear?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seems that sometimes I am too honest, so I&rsquo;ve reflected a little.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd&rsquo;s words of gratitude had eased my tension.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even if there was a good reason for, I had certainly done something wrong, so it was natural to feel relieved that I was not being resented for it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just when I was thinking that I could now face the meeting in a good mood, someone came rushing into the waiting room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Vesta.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s with all the panic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the time for such things, Rimuru-sama! I just received an urgent message from my home, and it seems that King Gazel is on his way here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By &lsquo;his home,&rsquo; he probably meant from one of the family members who remained in the Dwarven Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vesta was still a former minister of the great kingdom of Dwargon. He was a duke, a nobleman of high rank second only to the royal family.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was probably why he had been jealous of Kaijin, a commoner&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although Vesta was expelled from Dwargon, it did not appear that his relationship with his family had been severed. It appears that Vesta had been keeping in touch with the duke family.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The reason was that Vesta was still the head of the duke&rsquo;s household.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was also surprised when I was told this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The punishment given by King Gazel did not include taking away or demoting his title. It was only punishment for Vesta himself, and no blame was placed on his family. Moreover, no successor to Vesta was named, so there was no change in the head of the family.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The wise King Gazel must have intended to reinstate Vesta as a minister in the future. That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t punish him excessively and instead asked for him to reflect on his actions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another reason seems to be that he was afraid of the reaction of his family members.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the Vesta Duchy were really serious, they were capable of starting a civil war in Dwargon, and Gazel probably wanted to avoid unnecessary conflicts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, Vesta, who was no longer jealous, was a good man and well-liked by his own people. His influence was so great that he was punished with a spoonful of punishment that would not cause dissatisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why the Vesta family was still alive and well, and it seems that they still had contacts in the royal court.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But I still didn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, why? Didn&rsquo;t you tell him I was going to explain everything later?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s correct, but apparently His Majesty Gazel doesn&rsquo;t trust me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, no, no. That can&rsquo;t be true, can it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure about that. I have done a lot of things myself, such as negotiating the price of potions, pulling out technicians other than pharmacists, and securing human resources by mobilizing the entire Duchy. Even if I&rsquo;m suspected of being on your side, there&rsquo;s no way for me to refute it. In the first place, I am now prepared to devote myself to this country until I die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, it was not a matter of trust, but Vesta was just doing whatever he wanted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I originally thought he was a decent and serious man, but he was indeed a former minister. As a politician, he seemed to really understand the ins-and-outs.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oops, this was not the time to be impressed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If King Gazel was coming, then it would not be a good idea to start talks with the Empire right now. It would be rude to keep him waiting.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That said, it seems even more rude to come here without prior negotiation, so what should I do in such a case?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s King Gazel who&rsquo;s being rude, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Leaving aside the Vesta thing, it seemed like I didn&rsquo;t have to give up anything.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. If you enter a country without a notice, you can&rsquo;t argue with that even if you&rsquo;re attacked. So I&rsquo;m guessing we will be contacted once he&rsquo;s at the border.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vesta said that King Gazel would never lose his manners.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if to prove his point, a flustered messenger rushed into the room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to be rude, but I have an emergency report! We have just received a request for permission to enter from His Majesty Gazel of the Armed Nation of Dwargon&mdash;Five people in total. How should I proceed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no reason to refuse, but permission could not be so easily given&mdash;So that was why the ministerial staff had come to ask for my approval.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I think it was the most appropriate thing to do in this time of emergency.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even I would be upset if it were the other way around, so I think it was the right thing to do. It probably should have gone through the executives, but I&rsquo;d let it slide this time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shuna thoughtfully handed over a glass of water.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I spoke to the staff member who was drinking it gratefully.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then he prepared a magic tool for communication and started the liaison.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a result, it turned into an urgent meeting with King Gazel.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was why I personally came to pick him up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo and Shion were escorting me, but this was business as usual.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufu. Thank you, Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You knew this would happen, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even with the Pegasus, it would have taken a day to get from Dwargon to the Capital Rimuru. But now, since magic circles had been set up in both capitals, it was possible to travel back and forth by magic in an instant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why I guessed that the reason he came all the way to the border was to summon me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha, so you noticed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t funny, but it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad that Velgrynd can be so accommodating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing. You&rsquo;re not planning to join forces with the Empire, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So that was what Gazel was worried about, after all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It depends on the discussion, but that&rsquo;s the general idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm, wait a minute. I&rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts on the matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no reason to refuse, so we went to a coffee shop near the border.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The clerk hurriedly prepared a seat for me. Moreover, the customers, who appeared to be adventurers, read the situation and left their seats.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I felt bad, so I announced that I would take care of the bills here. Everyone was very happy, so I was sure they&rsquo;d be fine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were roughly 30 minutes left until the scheduled meeting time. We could be on the move instantaneously, so I was planning to listen to him until the last minute.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before that, I would start with what I had to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As for leaving you to clean up after the war&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Our soldiers are still struggling to work at full capacity&hellip;but that&rsquo;s only possible because we survived. I&rsquo;m grateful. There is no one who would hold a grudge against you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was good to hear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was a little worried about that, because even at barbecues, people who skipped on cleaning up were always resented.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, it was a tough fight. I was so happy to have made it through that I couldn&rsquo;t even think about the chores.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, what did you want to ask?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was planning to organize my thoughts depending on the flow of the conversation. I&rsquo;m sure there were things I couldn&rsquo;t answer if asked now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want to hear it clearly from you. You have no ambition to join forces with the Empire and attack me in Dwargon, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">What is this old man even talking about?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no way I would go through that much trouble.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no reason to, and above all, there was no benefit. On top of that, we would lose the trust of the Western Nations if we did so. It was a completely impossible option.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No. The trust we&rsquo;ve worked so hard to accumulate would be lost in an instant. And on top of losing a reliable backer, we would be burdened with unnecessary hard work. Asking me such a question&hellip;how stupid do you think I am?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I replied with a look of annoyance, and Gazel began to laugh, looking sincerely relieved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Hey, come on, you weren&rsquo;t actually worried about that, were you?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My apologies, Your Majesty Rimuru. These allegations were all my own proposition. Therefore, I take full responsibility for offending you. I hope you will be so kind as to forgive me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dolph-san must have noticed my annoyance, and expressed his apologies.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I asked him to explain in detail what he meant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To put it simply, if the Empire and Tempest were to join forces, Dwargon would be sandwiched between the two powers. In this case, resorting to force would be suicidal, and a decline in diplomatic power would be inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If a country declared that they would not listen to the arguments of an opponent they did not fear, that country would be forced to accept unfavorable conditions in future negotiations. He had been afraid of this, and wanted to confirm it in advance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? But that&rsquo;s not something Dwargon could stop either way, is it? Although I have no intention of starting a war, I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to join forces with the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. In the end, it all comes down to what you wish. Although Dwargon is a great power, we do not have the strength to compete with the True Dragons Velgrynd and Veldora. Dolph&rsquo;s worries are meaningless, but as a king, I cannot simply admit it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel said this to me with a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a king responsible to his people, he must always be prepared for any eventuality.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only this time, it was pointless to worry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there was also no guarantee that we would not start a war.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even if we did not start one, the situation would be the same if the Empire did.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Assuming that the Empire and Tempest had formed an alliance, whose side would Tempest really be on if the Empire tried to attack Dwargon?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If I were to be asked that, I would be at a loss.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru, do you understand? You chose to join forces with the Empire to keep your country from going to war. That is all well and good, but it didn&rsquo;t consider the situation in Dwargon. Of course, I&rsquo;m not saying that that&rsquo;s a bad thing, because you&rsquo;re only responsible for your own people. However, on my side, I cannot easily allow it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, I was convinced.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Indeed, even if Tempest had an alliance with both Dwargon and the Eastern Empire, it did not mean that any relationship was formed between Dwargon and the Eastern Empire.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If these two countries were to go to war, our own movements would be restricted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But wait?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But because we have &lsquo;mutual military cooperation&rsquo; in the event of national crisis&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no set deadline for that, is there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a permanent agreement. All of them are temporary agreements that can only provide temporary peace of mind. In fact, you could even argue that having an agreement with a fixed term is safer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just as I was wondering about what he meant, Ciel secretly coached me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were two types of agreements&mdash;those with no fixed term and those with a fixed term.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Assuming that one side wanted to break the agreement, which one would be more difficult?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If there was no deadline, one could ask the other to break the agreement at any time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the other hand, if there was a fixed term, things could be considered safe while the agreement was in place.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It went without saying that it would be more credible to terminate the agreement and then launch a war, rather than a breaking the agreement and invading in a breach of trust.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, this was only an appeal to other nations, and if they had territorial ambitions like the empire, it&rsquo;s possible that they would not care at all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was clearly out of the question to break a fixed term agreement without permission. Both parties were obliged to abide by the agreement when it was renewed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If I did such a thing, I would lose the trust of the Western Nations. It would be a major deviation from my strategy, so it would be better to lay down realistic and reliable rules.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. So even if we&rsquo;re allied with the Empire, there&rsquo;s still a chance that the agreement could be abandoned. That&rsquo;s why you came all the way out here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely something to worry about. Understood! Well then, even if we decide to form an alliance with the Empire, we&rsquo;ll discuss the details of the terms carefully.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I said that, Dolph-san and the others looked relieved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Look at that. I told you that you were worrying too much!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The words came abruptly from King Gazel. Where had all his kingly responsibility gone now?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, it&rsquo;s almost time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shion reminded me, looking at her watch.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was one of the watches I had made with Kaijin as a hobby. I gave it to her as a gift, thinking it necessary for a secretary to wear one. She was delighted upon receiving it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a good memory for all of us, as it gave Shion another job to do.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kufufufu. Then I will open the portal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus ended the spur-of-the-moment meeting.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We walked out of the coffee shop and returned to the conference room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everyone had all gathered in the conference room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The participants were seated at a partially round table with a gap.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Or rather, the table was shaped like the &lsquo;C&rsquo; in an eye test.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;This design, known as the &ldquo;Landolt Ring,&rdquo; was invented by the Swiss ophthalmologist, Edmund Landolt, in 1888&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s great to be so detailed, but I don&rsquo;t want to get into all that right now, so please just explain the key points.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One could go in and out through the gap in the table, making it easy to serve tea and materials to each person. In addition, a huge screen was installed at the end of the gap section so that everyone in the meeting could watch from any angle without having their view blocked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the meeting was to be held by the three major powers, it was decided that such a shape would be more suitable than simply facing each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The gap section was located on the southern side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My group was seated on the northern side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was in the in the true north seat, while Benimaru was in the northeast seat, and Rigurd was in the northwest seat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shion and Diablo were standing behind me, as usual, without sitting down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the Eastern side sat the Imperials.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was seated due east, and Velgrynd was seated to his right in the east-northeast seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His southern flank was occupied by General Calgurio and Major General Minits.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jiwu and Bernie were not seated, but stood behind Masayuki. It was good to see that the two were in charge of the escort. It also meant that they had smoothly reconciled.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the Western side of the table was Gazel and his group, who had joined in urgently.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel was in the seat due west.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The northwest seat was occupied by Dolph, the Commander of the Pegasus Knights, and the southwest seat was occupied by Jaine, the court mage (archwizard).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anrietta, the Head of the Night Assassins, and Vaughn, the Admiral Paladin, did not take their seats, but stood and acted as guards.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, just like this, the three forces faced each other.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I looked around just in time to see Masayuki, who&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be wandering around.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His expression was exhausted, as if to eloquently say, </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;Why am I in this situation?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But rest assured.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because of this sense of closeness, I wanted to help him if anything happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The moderator of the meeting, Testarossa, stood up and drew everyone&rsquo;s attention.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She stepped to the center of the room and began the introductory remarks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now, the time has come. It looks like everyone is here, so I would like to begin the meeting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After a bow, Testarossa returned to the southern side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were chairs put there for her sit and rest when it was not her turn.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had asked her in advance to help me if there was trouble, so I was sure Testarossa would live up to my expectations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;First of all, I would like to explain the purpose of this meeting. Because this is a high priority meeting without prior consultation, there may cases where unwanted remarks are made. In such a case, I would please ask you to remain calm and listen to the other side&rsquo;s arguments first, rather than becoming belligerent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this time, Testarossa paused and looked at each of the participants to see their reactions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the representative of my country in the Western States Council, Testarossa was very familiar with these situations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Hoping that this would go on smoothly until the end of the meeting, I continued to watch Testarossa with that desire.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let us begin by confirming the final objectives of this meeting. With the Imperial side, we would like to conclude an agreement to end the war. And with the Dwargon side, we would like to conclude a new treaty based on our future relationships with the Empire. Is that correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No objections.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki looked as if he wanted to say something, but Velgrynd answered before he could.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, I have no objection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the same time, Gazel nodded gravely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was a little late in response, but I didn&rsquo;t panic and opened my mouth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, let&rsquo;s examine the status quo first&mdash;that all right with you guys?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My tone of speech was a little odd, but who cares?</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I checked the reactions of both sides, while maintaining a natural expression.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki was looking at me with respect.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fufu, what a cute guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s right, I think I&rsquo;m really amazing too.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because the people gathered here now are very important people from very important countries. In my previous life, I had never been to an event where one could meet a member of Parliament, let alone the prime minister.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At most, I only met the staff from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism when they came to inspect the site. It was not really a kind of entertainment, but just a tour of the site.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Back then, I had been nervous just to make small talk about something other than my work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And now, I&rsquo;m the king. I was deeply moved just at the thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Since there seems to be no objection, I will leave it to Testarossa to explain. My remarks will follow later. If there are any questions or doubts, I will accept them and correct any mistakes. Now then, please explain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The meeting proceeded as planned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After asking for no interruptions, I left it to Testarossa who took over. She said this would help the conversation to proceed smoothly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">King Gazel, who is my equal, Emperor Masayuki, and Velgrynd, the plenipotentiary agent, were also allowed to speak. Anyone else, however, would be punished for insulting the king&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I felt a little indifferent about this, but if it would make thing easier, I had no complaints.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa began the explanation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With a few falsehoods mixed in, she described the battle on the airship that Gazel and the others may not have known about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then I tried to tell them that Emperor Rudra had actually been taken over by the conscious will of a Skill. And before that, just as I had won the battle with Velgrynd&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel objected first.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? If you want to speak, please do so afterwards&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Did I do something strange?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Um, King Gazel, is there something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I couldn&rsquo;t help but become meek and ask. Gazel stared at me while holding his head. Without saying a word, he then turned his gaze to Velgrynd and opened his mouth solemnly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s rude. But will Velgrynd-sama tolerate what King Rimuru has just said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Quite unusually, Gazel was speaking with honorifics.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And he was even calling Velgrynd with &lsquo;-sama.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This seemed to be an attitude unbecoming of a king of a great nation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I watched the situation unfold, Velgrynd flashed a smile without getting angry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No problem, King of the Dwarves. You are very shrewd and thoughtful, a much better king than Rimuru over there. Rudra thinks very highly of you and had been talking about taking you under his wing ever since you became a Sword Saint. So I am also well aware of you and do not dislike you. No need to be so formal, just take it easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Y-Yes! But no, you who are the guardian deity of the Empire, and one of the most powerful True Dragons, in public&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about it. I won&rsquo;t do anything about it. You&rsquo;re Rimuru&rsquo;s friend, aren&rsquo;t you? In that case, I won&rsquo;t fight. After all, what Rimuru said earlier was true. I was defeated by him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, that was surprising.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was expecting Velgrynd to be like Veldora and claim that she hadn&rsquo;t lost to save face. But instead, she gracefully and easily admitted her defeat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was surprised by this, but the others seemed more than just surprised.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Geeee-eh?! Wh&mdash;Velgrynd-sama was defeated?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. The myth of the unbeatable&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Imperial congregation, who had been cultivated under Velgrynd&rsquo;s domination, had abandoned their previous silence and were now in turmoil.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wha&mdash;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;H-Hey, are you serious?! You defeated that god-like existence who was undefeatable no matter the circumstance? I can&rsquo;t believe it, but if she admits it, then I guess it means you&rsquo;re not lying&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dolph-san was in a daze, and Vaughn-san couldn&rsquo;t seem to accept the reality.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anrietta-san was smiling at them and King Gazel for some reason.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufu, I feel so refreshed because I don&rsquo;t have to report this time. If I had reported this story, people would have suspected that I was mentally ill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Isn&rsquo;t that disrespectful?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, I wasn&rsquo;t going to stop her because it was a story from another country, and it felt like now was not the time to get into it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I was observing from a distance, Jaine-san called out to Gazel, who was contemplating with his head in his hands.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gazel-boy, and you guys too, all of you need to calm down. I&rsquo;m not even surprised anymore. I already got tired and surprised by the primordials, and by the time I saw the evolution festival, I understood that it was foolish to keep being shocked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seemed Grandma Jaine had been enlightened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why she alone was able to get through this time calmly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The people on Dwargon&rsquo;s side came to their senses with those words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were embarrassed and straightened their posture one by one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By the way, the reaction from our side was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?! So Rimuru-sama has triumphed in the face of Velgrynd-sama. Are we having a feast tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rigurd really did find every opportunity to party.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You didn&rsquo;t doubt my victory from the start, did you?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I thought that was the case. Or rather, I was watching it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This guy, Benimaru, actually said he was spying on me. Although it seems that someone overheard you.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Benimaru, what do you mean? No way&hellip;You didn&rsquo;t watch Rimuru-sama fight with such majesty all by yourself, did you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;N-No, it&rsquo;s not like that. It was my duty to confirm the status of the battle, so, just a little&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He seemed to be desperately trying to think of an excuse, but that was one of Benimaru&rsquo;s weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo, on the other hand&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kufufufu. Oh, Shion, did you not see it? I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. It&rsquo;s quite a shame that you were unable to witness such a magnificent battle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Do not agitate her! Do not agitate her!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Was nobody better than this guy at harassing people?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa was sighing in amazement, estimating that nobody could be as troublesome than Diablo.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Everyone, please remain calm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa was dumbfounded, but she had not forgotten her role. She saw the time for everyone to gradually quiet down, and raised her voice to calm the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If she had been one step behind, Shion and Diablo might have started a fight.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Good job</span><span class="c2">, I silently praised her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that everyone had regained their composure, the meeting continued.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa, the moderator, signaled me to continue, so I did.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;Well, as mentioned previously, I defeated Velgrynd-san and then questioned her about the situation in detail, at which point I discovered discrepancies in the story. It seemed to me that Emperor Rudra was not entirely himself, so I observed Velgrynd-san until I learned the terrible truth. I won&rsquo;t go into too many details, but it turns out that her thoughts were being &lsquo;dominated.&rsquo; And the culprit was indeed Michael, the conscious will of Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s Skill!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I put on a smug look with all my might.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now came the good part.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I grinned and was about to continue&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh no, someone was talking again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moreover, it was still Gazel this time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll deal with your questions later, so&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As if to interrupt my words, or perhaps to calm himself down, Gazel let out a big sigh.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, with his eyes fixed on me, he opened his mouth gravely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Listen, Rimuru. It&rsquo;s true that this attitude of mine is inappropriate, but, well, this is really not the time to worry about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How can you leave out so many details?! A vicious Skill that can dominate even Velgrynd-sama!&mdash;how can that even exist?! And what was it you just said?! The will of a Skill?? I&rsquo;ve never heard of such a thing! Jaine, do you know anything about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;I &hellip;No, I&rsquo;ve never heard of it either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel was desperately trying to keep his composure, but he still couldn&rsquo;t hide his exuberance. When asked by Gazel, Jaine-san&rsquo;s response was sluggish, as if she was thinking too much about something.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That said, it was strange that no one was complaining about Gazel&rsquo;s attitude.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd herself was smiling and seemed to be enjoying the situation. It seemed that as long as Masayuki was around, nothing else was needed or interested her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for Masayuki, he seemed to have already given up on understanding the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was sitting in his chair in a very dignified manner, as if it was none of his business. By doing so, he seems to have been misunderstood by Calgurio and the rest of the empire, and in doing so had further increased his own reputation. But I guess he himself did not realize it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">About that, let&rsquo;s just tell say &lsquo;don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Benimaru and the others were also very interested.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If I didn&rsquo;t want to say it, they wouldn&rsquo;t have pursued it, but in their hearts, they most likely still wanted to hear about it from me anyway.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was probably why Testarossa did not stop Gazel either.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, she seemed to have sensed her lapse in judgment and was trying to manage the situation as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Everyone, please remain calm. Regarding King Gazel&rsquo;s questions&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although I was impressed at how quickly she recovered, trying to remedy this situation was going to be difficult. I mean, I could just let it go, but I decided that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to explain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll explain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, is that all right with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. There are only a few important people from each country here anyway. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll reveal the secret lightly, and even if they did, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no particular problem about revealing the existence of the Manas. The only secret that I had to strictly keep was the existence of Ciel.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Rimuru. I appreciate you for doing this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel bowed to me, expressing his gratitude.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His tone had returned to that of a senior brother, as if he had given up trying to fix things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I felt much better and went straight into my explanation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then I explained that as a result of Emperor Rudra&rsquo;s exhaustion, the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; that he had once possessed, had developed an ego, and had become the &ldquo;Manas&rdquo; Michael. I disclosed its heinous powers to the best of my knowledge.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ultimate Skill&hellip;? So you&rsquo;re saying that powers of the unique level will not work on someone who possesses it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Strictly speaking, no. Skills vary in strength depending on the strength of one&rsquo;s will, so even at the unique level, there are skills that reach the ultimate level, though those are usually few and far between. In addition, special techniques (Arts), which reflect the strength of will, may result in attacks that can reach the ultimate level. In my opinion, I think Gazel King could do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Also, magic is the same. Magic is both a Skill and an Art, so depending on the strength of the user&rsquo;s will, they may be able to defeat even the Ultimate Skill holders. Jiwu and Bernie should understand what I&rsquo;m saying, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those two had been defeated by Diablo, so they should be able to understand what I was talking about. When I asked them, they both nodded emphatically.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for Diablo, he had a sickeningly intoxicated expression on his face, so I didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">He definitely wasn&rsquo;t thinking anything good, and though I was tempted to say something to him, he was standing quietly for now, so I decided to just ignore it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shion then muttered, &ldquo;Then I guess I should acquire an Ultimate Skill as well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You know, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not easy so easy to get that it&rsquo;s called the ultimate, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But for some reason, I had the feeling that Shion could do it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That seemed a little scary, so I stopped thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s pretty much how it is. Michael has special powers that allow him to have absolute control over the Angelic System of Skills. That is why Velgrynd-san couldn&rsquo;t resist, and was at his mercy without even realizing it. It seems that Lieutenant Kondou was also under the control of his Skill, though in the end, he broke free from the spell and entrusted his will to our Carrera.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What, even that information-feeding monster was&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, but I&rsquo;m not so foolish as to doubt His Majesty Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see, so then Damrada-sama&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. I think he might have noticed that something was wrong with His Majesty the Emperor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Though not enough to interrupt what I was saying, there was a commotion from the Imperial side. This was an act that should not have been done, but it was too late to care about it now, so I would just ignore it and continue.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As for Michael&rsquo;s purpose, this is also known. It is to resurrect his true master and creator, Veldanava.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Nonsense&mdash;!!&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The shouts overlapped, and it was difficult to tell who was speaking.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, actually I knew, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have helped to point it out.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Knowing that it was all due to Michael&rsquo;s domination, I do not intend to hold the Imperial side responsible for the war. If they wish to continue to wage war against us in the future&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I broke off at this point and glanced at Masayuki and the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki remained completely unfazed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was completely oblivious to the situation, to the point of being admirable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio and Minits were smiling bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no way they could win, and there was also no reason to fight anymore. They understood that, which was why they were reacting this way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Looks like things seemed okay.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;It does not seem to me that you have any such intention. I have also made peace with Velgrynd-san, so now it is necessary to establish a new leader now that Michael, who was playing as Rudra, has gone into hiding. That&rsquo;s what the meeting for today was about, so can you shed some light on that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I asked, dropping the topic to Masayuki and the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In order to have a common understanding of the current situation, we needed to know what the future of the empire would be. That was what Gazel and the others were most concerned about, so I thought we should discuss it here, without hiding anything.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, this was also a gamble.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Normally, when you hold a meeting like this, you are supposed to confirm not only your own ideas but also the opinions of the other side beforehand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since we did not do so, we could not predict what kind of conclusion we would reach. I was told that this was normally not allowed to be done in discussions between countries.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa, however, did not stop me. She laughed and said that it would not be a problem, so I stopped caring and went ahead with my honest talk.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The result was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Minits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! I, Minits, would humbly like to take this opportunity to explain. The current state of the Empire is that we have lost over two-thirds of our forces, and further war is impossible. We are willing to accept full and unconditional surrender, but there is one problem, and that is the absence of a supreme commander. As His Majesty Rimuru has just pointed out, the most important thing is to find a new leader. So today is the perfect opportunity to ask for the approval of our new Emperor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits said this without hesitation, bowed, and then looked at me and Gazel in turn.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm, so that&rsquo;s how it was. Rimuru, I take it that my arrival today was exactly as you planned?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Huh?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course not.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You got me. This isn&rsquo;t about the Empire and Tempest joining forces, it&rsquo;s about Tempest backing the new Emperor and building a solid foundation for the Empire. In that case, of course&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, needless to say, Dwargon will be joining, so I guess I can expect something in return, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How did we go from talking about acknowledging the new Emperor to talking about building a foundation or some nonsense?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;King Gazel&rsquo;s words are very encouraging. Naturally, in return, we would like to live up to your expectations as much as possible within the limits of what is acceptable to both countries, so please rest assured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits&mdash;no, let&rsquo;s call him Minits-san. Unlike when he&rsquo;s fighting, he has the mannerisms of an effective politician. He&rsquo;s just as graceful, but he seems to be able to do everything with ease.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I, on the other hand, am struggling to comprehend the situation. Nobody could see it because I wasn&rsquo;t sweating, but inwardly I was in a panic.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, now that Gazel seems to have agreed, I was next. Benimaru and Rigurd glanced at me, so I nodded back, and opened my mouth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I also agree. And I promise to do my best to provide full support depending on the situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would just go with the flow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was finally catching up to the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had intended to help Masayuki from the beginning, but if I thought about it carefully, that would mean supporting him as a nation. If we could build a better relationship in the future by selling favors here, we would never have to go to war with them again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, even if things didn&rsquo;t go that well, we should be okay for the time being. All the rest can just be left to future generations, so the most important thing was the &lsquo;now.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much. I&rsquo;m sure the His Majesty the Emperor will be pleased to hear that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits-san bowed once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You don&rsquo;t have to be so formal. Just get on with it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, the new emperor is Masayuki-kun, right? Ah, then is it bad to call you that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;King Rimuru&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no problem at all. In fact, can I still call you Rimuru-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ah, Masayuki, a friend of my heart!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, Masayuki-kun! It&rsquo;s so hard to understand what kinds of words to use in these situations, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru-san! I haven&rsquo;t been able to relax until just now&mdash;Rimuru-san has never been as reliable as he is now!! These past few days, I&rsquo;ve been feeling so suffocated&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, I understand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You&rsquo;ve been struggling all alone without help, haven&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about the feelings of her subordinates. She probably wouldn&rsquo;t understand why you were so worried about such trivial things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Empire&rsquo;s leaders must have been occupied with their own affairs. They must have been so busy with their own problems that they had no time to think about Masayuki&rsquo;s situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s probably why he wanted to talk to me, but it was a mistake to let Shion send the message.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, I really would have preferred to have had a private meeting with him to figure out what to do. I felt that way, and I&rsquo;m sure Masayuki felt the same way too.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But now that this all happened, it couldn&rsquo;t be helped anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t know anything about etiquette, so I&rsquo;m just going to continue with what I want.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;May I have all your attention, please?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before anyone else could say anything, it was Testarossa who spoke up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Our king, Rimuru-sama, would prefer the meeting to be more relaxed and casual. We may all have our own positions, but I&rsquo;m sure we can understand each other&rsquo;s perspectives, so can we please agree continue the meeting more informally?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa looked at everyone present with a smile as she said so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nothing could be more reliable than that!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki looked happy too.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel chuckled, and did not argue.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that the kings had given their approval, there would be no objections from the subordinates. That was the end of the formal discussion, and now the real talks began.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Geez, that really saved me. I was thinking of keeping silent the entire time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, I wanted to do that too, actually.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Idiots. What is the leader of a country to do with that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufufu, Gazel-boy says that, but he used to be the same way. Dignity and formality are things that can be mended over time with practice and experience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Jaine, you don&rsquo;t have to bring that up here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The tension disappeared in an instant, and it only took a moment to relax.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was probably because Masayuki had been appointed Emperor and we had already decided to back him up. All that was left was to work out the details, so there was no need for formal conversation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, in a casual manner, I asked the question that had been bothering me the most.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;By the way, it&rsquo;s fine for Masayuki to become Emperor, but will the Imperial people accept it? We&rsquo;re fine with it, but what about the people? Or are they subjects? Anyway, if the people don&rsquo;t agree, it&rsquo;s no good, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing that, Masayuki nodded his head in agreement more enthusiastically than I would have liked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course! It&rsquo;s completely ridiculous, isn&rsquo;t it?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ahem! Your Majesty, please calm down a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio admonished him, but Masayuki seemed to have no intention of letting the question go unanswered.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Gazel who came to his rescue.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In the first place, what are you going to do about the bloodline issue? He does not share a single drop of blood with Emperor Rudra, right? If you do not protect the royal line, the nobles will not be satisfied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That question was answered by Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No problem. It is written in the imperial code that </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;The person recognized by Velgrynd, the guardian dragon of the empire, is both Rudra and the Emperor.&rsquo; </span><span class="c2">Although many might think of this as a formality, it is the truth and the most important sentence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits-san came forward to endorse that statement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. His Majesty Rudra has always reincarnated as the wife&rsquo;s first son, but in the long history of the empire, there have been arrogant people who have sought to replace their successors. The one who saw through them and punished them was the Marshal here, Velgrynd-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course it was bound to be exposed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anyone who understood how Rudra&rsquo;s reincarnation worked could easily tell the difference between the real one and an impostor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t even want to imagine how those people were punished. Even if I don&rsquo;t bother to ask, I&rsquo;m sure it was horrible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, His Majesty Rudra inherited the ego. Even if Velgrynd-sama hadn&rsquo;t pointed it out, it would have revealed itself when he grew up&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I see, so once they&rsquo;ve grown to the point where they&rsquo;re self-aware, it is easy to identify them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, what about calling Masayuki an illegitimate child?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible, Rimuru-sama. The Senate has Rudra&rsquo;s records. Not only his blood type, but even his DNA. The mother can be faked, but it would be impossible to claim Masayuki-sama as the son of His Majesty Rudra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oops, so then the Empire&rsquo;s technology had advanced that far? I had thought it was a good idea, but Minits-san rejected it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Even so, I didn&rsquo;t realize that DNA testing existed in this world&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is DNA?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since Gazel asked me, I would clarify.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Next to him, Calgurio and the others were chatting.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I hear it&rsquo;s a big deal because there were no precise ways to test it back then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Every time I was asked to make a decision, it was a pain in the ass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that be even worse?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now that the real person was gone, there was only Masayuki&mdash;the reincarnated one who had lost his memory. It was difficult to prove that the &lsquo;soul&rsquo; is real, so in other words, there was no way for others to recognize Masayuki as the true Emperor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier for Masayuki to just imitate Rudra, since they have the same face?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We could use the emperor&rsquo;s privilege to cover up the inspection.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then we could find the opportunity to replace Rudra&rsquo;s records and be done with it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rejected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I thought this was a good idea, but Velgrynd rejected it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten Michael&rsquo;s power, have you? Michael&rsquo;s energy comes from the loyalty of his subjects and followers of Rudra. So, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to pretend that Emperor Rudra is dead and take away that power?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oops?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, I remembered that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Correct. It is pointless to just pretend he&rsquo;s dead, but if there is a new target of loyalty, Michael&rsquo;s power can be blocked. However, Michael might have anticipated this and changed the target of his power from Rudra to someone else.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, he had already said something about killing all the subjects.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he was going to do that, then he would surely use someone I couldn&rsquo;t touch as an energy source.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Or someone incredibly powerful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Michael would have taken countermeasures, but it&rsquo;s safer to do it than to not. That way, we won&rsquo;t have to deal with the subjects.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right, so let&rsquo;s not worry about the details. Just announce that Masayuki is Rudra in my name. That way, no one will be able to resist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd was very confident.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But then again, that was to be expected.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, she was the Scorch Dragon, the guardian dragon of the empire.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides, it made sense in light of the Imperial Code, which stated that the person approved by Velgrynd would become Emperor Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The approach would be tough, but as long as it was Velgrynd&rsquo;s true statement, it couldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that okay with you, Masayuki-kun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t it be fine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;Well, how should I put it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I felt that there shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, but I would have to go with the flow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it Masayuki, then there&rsquo;s no need to push yourself, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wow, Velgrynd&rsquo;s smile was so gentle&mdash;gentle to the point of being scary. That description was a contradiction in terms, but it&rsquo;s what I really felt.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ll do it. I&rsquo;m being hailed as a hero anyway, so one more title won&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki declared; his eyes vacant as if he had reached enlightenment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits-san, Calgurio and the others were happy to hear this. They seemed to think that a new symbol and leader was absolutely necessary for the future survival of the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I, too, think Masayuki is the right man for the job, and with his Skill, he would be able to gain the absolute support of the people.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So then, the way forward is to install Masayuki as the new Emperor and move to solidify the claim, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I confirmed this, everyone other than Masayuki sharply nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki nodded reluctantly in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki, despite his appearance, was a responsible person. Once he took on the task, I knew he would carry it through to the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood. Then we will announce our approval. I will also promise to immediately release the Imperial officers currently held as prisoners of war in our country. We will not hold them responsible, but we will still withhold compensation. What do you think? We can discuss compensations at a later date, after Masayuki has ascended to the throne as the new Emperor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you for your generosity. I&rsquo;m grateful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just when I thought everyone had approved, Gazel had something more to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have no objection to this approach either, but I do have one question. Masayuki-dono, you may be a Hero, but you are about to become an Emperor. So I would like to ask you, what principles do you intend to use to unite your people&mdash;your subjects?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel stared at Masayuki with a piercing gaze that seemed to see through everything.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki flinched at the aura, but looked at me as if troubled, then opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;Uhh&hellip;hmm? Creating a world where people can live with laughter&hellip;something like that, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I laughed when I heard that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because he was thinking the same way I did.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s the most important thing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I knew Rimuru-san would say that!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, Masayuki-kun. Alas, when I told this to Rudra, he only made fun of me for being young and naive, and I was worried that I had been mistaken. But now I can rest assured. It looks like I was right the whole time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Great! I&rsquo;ve never been good at politics either, so I wasn&rsquo;t confident about anything. But now, I can be an emperor with pride.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right. Let&rsquo;s do our best together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, I look forward to working with you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that, Masayuki and I laughed loudly together.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were different reactions to those who were watching us.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo and Shion had a look of intoxication.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd smiled kindly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio and Minits were smiling half-heartedly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel looked up helplessly at the sky.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufufu, I understand your concern, Gazel, but these people have no ambitions. But they&rsquo;re amateurs, that&rsquo;s for sure, so you&rsquo;ll just have to guide them, and make sure they stay on the right path.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m just thinking about how difficult it will be to guild these people who talk about politics with such naive idealism.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel gave another big sigh after saying that. After all, Gazel was always worried about us like this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry so much, I&rsquo;m studying too, so it&rsquo;ll be fine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not only Gazel, but also Vesta and El-tan</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;were teaching me, so I would probably be fine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was just in my spare time, but it was still true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he was still worried about this, then I would reassure him a little more.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In the first place, I&rsquo;m not planning to get too involved in politics. Masayuki, you should just let Minits-san and the others handle the actual work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! That&rsquo;s actually what I was planning to do, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was a good idea. Now I feel much better about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki and I laughed together once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;Well, do whatever you want. You&rsquo;re not alone. You can take responsibility and grow with your comrades. If possible, I will help you too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel still had his head in his hands, but he was finally convinced. No, he may not have been fully convinced, but he was still willing to support us in the long run.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so the meeting proceeded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As for me, I have no objection to the approach decided at this meeting. If the eastern lands are stabilized, our country will also be at peace. I will help with the reconstruction near the border as much as I can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you, King Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And just like that, things worked out beautifully.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;From this day on, history books of future generations would record this day as the appearance of the savior Emperor Masayuki Rudra Nam Ul Nasca&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And thus, the plan had been set.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, we would take a break and have lunch.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because the atmosphere was already relaxed, the meal proceeded in a friendly manner.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Today&rsquo;s lunch was kaiseki cuisine.</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although we were in the middle of a break, we were still in the middle of a meeting, so we chose a menu that could properly entertain the dignitaries. Shuna had prepared it with great care.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everyone used chopsticks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel had mastered it a long time now, and the chopstick culture was widespread in the empire, making us feel at ease to prepare the food Japanese style.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As always, the food here is delicious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It makes me want to drink.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Be more restrained, Vaughn! Even if it&rsquo;s informal, we still have an important meeting to attend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a serious man, Dolph. Rimuru-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;d like some sake too, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I nodded and glanced at Shuna.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She gave a smiling face.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yup, it&rsquo;s impossible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hold back for now and do our best for the rest of the meeting. Vaughn-san, you should learn from Dolph-san and be more serious!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha, that&rsquo;s harsh. Then can I count on you for this evening?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course you can, right Benimaru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. Let&rsquo;s take out our secret stash of black liquor and have a party!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, that sounds good! Benimaru-dono has good taste too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha, I heard that demons are famous for their love of alcohol.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? Shuna drinks alcohol too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Benimaru said something surprising while I was casually ignoring the gossip. To my surprise, he said that Shuna drank alcohol.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The truth is&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Brother, I only try it occasionally. Please do not lump me in with Shion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, so she does drink.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had thought Shuna was underage, but I guess age didn&rsquo;t matter to a monster.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha, sorry, sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shuna-sama! I don&rsquo;t drink that much either!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s a lie.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As far as I know, Shion and Alvis are the best drinkers in the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Benimaru also knew about this, so he smiled bitterly at it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t imagine Benimaru to be a drinker, but I guess Alvis was his wife too. In that case, he might have been drinking with his wife, turning him into strong drinker.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you get used to it, it becomes something you start to enjoy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just do it in moderation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t just drink alcohol to get drunk.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I thought I should remind myself and others to enjoy in moderation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The luncheon would have continued as light and pleasant, but suddenly, someone burst into tears.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All eyes were drawn to the person, wondering what was going on.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Calgurio.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, sir? Is the food not to your liking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shuna, who had rushed over to Calgurio, asked while comforting him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio opened his mouth to reply.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, please excuse me. I just remembered something. I know it might be ridiculous for a military man to say this, but I sacrificed many men because of my foolish plan. Yet I am savoring this delicious meal knowing they will never return. I&rsquo;m sorry, it was my fault&hellip;Farage, Gaster, and Zamud&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This guy is a crying drunk, isn&rsquo;t he?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I hadn&rsquo;t served him any alcohol, but it seems that he got drunk from just the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, I guess this was a good time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Testarossa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve already sent word to Moss and summoned those men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As expected of her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before I could even give the order, Testarossa had already read my intentions and acted upon them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, in less than five minutes, dozens of men had showed up to the venue.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your Majesty Rimuru, Zamud is here upon hearing your call!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The people who came were the same people that Calgurio had just mentioned, including Major General Zamud and his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They seemed to have come running as fast as they could, their faces bright red with sweat. Despite this, they desperately struggled to formulate their words in order to greet me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zamud and these people had actually died once.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were aboard the emperor&rsquo;s flagship airship, and were caught up in Testarossa&rsquo;s nuclear magic: &lsquo;Death Streak,&rsquo; which wiped out their bodies along with their lives.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the amazing thing about Testarossa was that she remembered that I had received a plea from Calgurio for Zamud and the others&rsquo; lives, so she recovered their souls before the magic took effect.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It all became possible because Rimuru-sama allowed me to evolve&rdquo;&mdash;She was so humble saying such things, but from my point of view, I was just grateful for her memory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, I took the souls of Zamud and the others from Testarossa and had them dwell in an Emulated Soul, establishing them in artificial human bodies (homunculi).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you Zamud?! I heard Velgrynd-sama say that you were all dead, but you&rsquo;re still alive!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true though. I really doubt they could have survived the &lsquo;Death Streak,&rsquo; so was it Testarossa who saved him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Velgrynd-sama. Rimuru-sama is a compassionate man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, I have no doubt about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very wise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Ufufufu, Ohohoho</span><span class="c2">&mdash;The two were talking while smiling at one another.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I felt a little scared, so I gently took my eyes off the scene.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zamud and the others had joined Calgurio and were congratulating each other on their safety.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for Farage-san, it&rsquo;s unfortunate, but I wasn&rsquo;t all-powerful either, so I hoped they would forgive me. And if they felt sorry for the death of someone close, then please don&rsquo;t ever engage in such a foolish act of war again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A defensive war may be unavoidable, but a war of aggression is the essence of foolishness. I understand that the world was not just a pretty place, but I still couldn&rsquo;t help thinking so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those in power should consider whether or not war was really necessary, putting their own families on the scale. I hoped that they would aim to eradicate barren conflict through dialogue as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This I did not say aloud, but prayed for it in my heart.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After the lunch break, the meeting resumed at 3 in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the morning session, the general plan had been decided. The afternoon session was scheduled to reconfirm them and discuss the sharing of responsibilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now then, allow me to reconfirm. First, the Armed Nation of Dwargon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa began the session.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, she listed the topics in need of confirmation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first step was for Tempest and Dwargon to jointly approve the accession of the new Emperor. Then, in the name of the new Emperor Masayuki, they would declare the end of the war and establish the Tripartite Alliance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, a framework different from that of the Western States Council would be created.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dwargon&rsquo;s role was to rebuild the area near the border together with the Empire, including the roads and buildings in the vicinity. To a lesser extent, this also included providing relief to the victims involved in the war.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Trust would come after trust was earned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that momentum, the construction of the railroad to the Imperial Capital would begin. We decided to accomplish this difficult task while rebuilding the road that the Magic Tank Division of the Empire had cut in the foothills of the Canaat Mountains.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A team of leaders from our country would also be dispatched to work with the dwarf engineers to complete the project.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the &lsquo;Magic Train&rsquo; came through, logistics would be streamlined, and people would be able to come and go as they pleased. We would be entering into a new era of development.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I dream of that day, I can&rsquo;t stop from feeling excited. Once again, I confirmed my preference to make constructive plans.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, what are the roles of our Jura Tempest Federation?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Our main responsibility was to provide full support to Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We would send Testarossa to set up an embassy in the Empire. The goal was to dispel the old mindset of the empire and make it feel as if a new era had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The subjects of the Empire had never been defeated in war before. They had never apologized to another nation for their mistakes, even when they were hurt by Veldora.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps this speaks to Rudra&rsquo;s greatness, but that was also a reason why the subjects of the Empire might not be able to accept this defeat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those who had lost loved ones would understand the pain. However, it was likely that those who were just sitting on their laurels at home would demand another war from a safe position.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They would focus only on the benefits to be gained and be insensitive to the pain of others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It is highly likely that they would not be pleased with Masayuki&rsquo;s opposition to war. With Velgrynd around, there was no point in directly interfering, but&hellip;they might interfere behind the scenes while showing reverence on the outside, which would be a very troublesome thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was up to Minits to persuade the nobles, and Calgurio would be in charge of the military. However, I was worried that the two of them were not strong enough to deal with the cunning old underbelly of society.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd had casually suggested, </span><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I just kill them all?&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;but we could not let her do such a thing. In an empire of dwindling talent, there was no way they could afford to reduce the number of human resources any further.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We would have to use such troublesome people to our advantage. The road ahead was a difficult, thorny path, but I had come to the conclusion in the last few days that we had no choice but to try.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is where Testarossa comes in.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With the help of Moss, our agent with a hell of an ear, we could sweep away the schemes of the malicious in one fell swoop. Even those who are troublesome when swarmed together may become cooperative if we threate&mdash;er, no, persuade them by grasping their individual weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Western States Council was now settled to the point where Cien alone could handle it, so it was decided that Testarossa would be transferred.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was also decided that Venom would continue to accompany Masayuki as his bodyguard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be borrowing some of your family members, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kufufufu, no problem. If it is for the good of Rimuru-sama, please do not hesitate to use them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had nothing to say about this. As for Diablo, it was too tiring to dig into it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike the morning discussion, the afternoon was livelier.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After the problems that the Imperial side had put together were disclosed, everyone discussed them to come up with countermeasures.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a very meaningful time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We, as members of the Empire, will never forget the kindness you have shown us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey now, we are still in the planning stages. We&rsquo;re just starting to make things happen. If you want to thank me, wait until the project is completed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha, the project, huh? I&rsquo;m no match for Your Majesty Rimuru&hellip;that this national challenge can be described in one word.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Minits-san was smiling.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But there was a gleam in his eyes, and my words seemed to have ignited his will to fight.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m glad that he was motivated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, we reached an agreement on the plan, but there was still a problem that we should not forget.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Gazel who mentioned it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, Rimuru. Let me ask you the most important question. Can you win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was true&hellip;Michael and Feldway, and their men&hellip;there was a threatening enemy out there, watching us with an eagle eye.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Honestly, I can&rsquo;t guarantee that I&rsquo;m going to win, but I&rsquo;m definitely not going to lose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s you after all, so no matter what method is used, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to turn those words into something real.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Even overestimated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c21"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmph! To be honest, when I saw Velgrynd-sama&rsquo;s strength, I was prepared for defeat and death. I knew she was strong, but I didn&rsquo;t expect her to be that powerful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vaughn and Dolph-san nodded in agreement at Gazel&rsquo;s frank confession.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, I thought it was over too when I saw Testarossa and the others collapse.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After that, because I was so angry, I got over my fear&mdash;or rather, I felt like it was over before I realized it, and thinking back on it now, I wonder how I even managed to win.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But well, I have Ciel now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And Veldora and Diablo and the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was reassuring to know that I&rsquo;m not alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d lose to a slime either, but now I&rsquo;m grateful. I don&rsquo;t think that even Velzard-nee can beat Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd, not offended by Gazel&rsquo;s words, said this quite matter-of-factly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I doubted that I could defeat Velzard-san, who had beaten Veldora one-sidedly, but I was pretty sure that Velgrynd was speaking from the heart.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also embarrassed by your high opinion of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be modest. Your victory over me was not by luck, but by sheer strength. Moreover, you won overwhelmingly, so what are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd was not ashamed of her defeat, because it was in the past for her. I think she had overcome it now and accepted it honestly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was people like that who scared me the most, and I secretly raised my alert level on Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From here, it was time to talk seriously about my own thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The reality is that we don&rsquo;t know what the enemy&rsquo;s true strength is, and we cannot predict how they&rsquo;ll react. Regardless of their purpose, I&rsquo;m curious about their aim, or rather, what kind of methods they will use.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I said this, I projected several people onto a giant screen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;These are the enemies that invaded the labyrinth this time. Their existence values are roughly equivalent to three million, which is a high level of strength even compared to the leaders of our country. They&rsquo;re such a nasty opponent that I think it&rsquo;s best to avoid fighting them one-on-one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After I said that, I disclosed all of the information I knew.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, as if to add to my story, Velgrynd said.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I eliminated this one, but I have a word of advice. These people are the ones who used to help Brother Veldanava in ancient times, and they are as nasty as the primordials. Their bodies are currently still sealed, and all those who appeared in the labyrinth were just a weakened &lsquo;Split Body.&rsquo; They can&rsquo;t be defeated by ordinary means, so you&rsquo;d better be on your guard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing that put one at a loss for words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because Velgrynd, the one who said such a thing, had already destroyed one of them so easily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;That is the effect of the &lsquo;Dimension Leap&rsquo; in Velgrynd&rsquo;s power. Velgrynd herself can only leap towards the mark of Rudra&rsquo;s soul fragment, but she should have no problems firing her technique towards the mark.&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I see&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, Velgrynd traced the connection between Cornu&rsquo;s &lsquo;Split Body&rsquo; and his main body, and destroyed both of them together.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;That&rsquo;s right. If it is a &lsquo;Spacetime Continuous Attack&rsquo; that can transcend time and space, then there is no way to escape it, even if the being is a &lsquo;Parallel Existence.&rsquo;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seriously, that&rsquo;s messed up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I mean, Velgrynd was just too good. I didn&rsquo;t know how much experience she had accumulated, but she was now perfectly in control of her own powers.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She was already powerful before, but now she had become even stronger.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldora was so happy to learn &lsquo;Parallel Existence,&rsquo; but this turned out to be completely pointless. I wonder if Veldora knew about this&hellip;I felt a little sorry for him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who didn&rsquo;t know how to react.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Imperials and Gazel&rsquo;s group were also pondering carefully over Velgrynd&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Empire still had a trump card with Velgrynd. They could rely on her, but the problem was Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t win, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Vaughn!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true. There&rsquo;s no point in trying to look good, so why don&rsquo;t we just have an honest discussion and think about countermeasures?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, no, you&rsquo;re right, but&hellip;but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Vaughn is right. We can&rsquo;t win against them anyway, but we should still have a plan for when we do encounter them. So, Your Majesty Rimuru, based on the goals of you, Michael, and the Phantom King, do you think Dwargon will also be involved?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hmm, it&rsquo;s unlikely, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It probably doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s safe, it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s a lower a priority.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm. So because the enemy&rsquo;s goal is to resurrect their God Veldanava, they don&rsquo;t care about Dwargon anyway, correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude, but I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. As a warrior, I am unhappy, but as a king, I am relieved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel finished and smiled bitterly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, by that measure, is the enemy serious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kufufufufu. Do they think that by harnessing the power of Veldora-sama and Velzard-sama, the resurrection of Veldanava-sama will be accomplished? All I can say is that it&rsquo;s a stupid idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In the first place, Veldanava-sama is immortal. To resurrect him through human power is beyond foolishness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo scoffed, and Benimaru was indignant.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It is a mystery as to why Veldanava has not been resurrected, but it is still true that the True Dragon race is immortal. I also agreed with the opinion that we should just leave it alone, left unspeakable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But if that&rsquo;s the case, won&rsquo;t the Dragon Princess be targeted as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio pointed out sharply.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Indeed, Milim had inherited Veldanava&rsquo;s power, so it would not be surprising if she was targeted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This question was answered by Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That possibility cannot be denied, but to mess with my brother&rsquo;s beloved would be to put the cart before the horse. It&rsquo;s possible for them to simply want to take his power, but if they sincerely wish for his resurrection, then I&rsquo;d like to think they wouldn&rsquo;t do anything that would offend him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, Milim was strong, and she didn&rsquo;t seem to have an Ultimate Skill of the Angelic System. Plus with Karion-san and Frey-san having awakened, I didn&rsquo;t think we would need to worry too much about her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since Velgrynd thought things were okay, it would probably be enough just to warn them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there was something else that bothered me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that way, doesn&rsquo;t it sound like Veldanava was unconcerned about his siblings?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty rude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd looked at me, seemingly more speechless than annoyed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m an honest person, so I just&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lucky.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd&rsquo;s generosity saved my life.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would reflect on this and be careful on what I said in the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. A True Dragon thinks differently than the rest of those who have an end in sight. The same goes for Velzard-nee, who has destroyed Veldora over and over again in the name of education. So, perhaps they are planning to wait for the resurrection of Brother Veldanava before releasing our power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, that made sense.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They think he&rsquo;ll be resurrected after he&rsquo;s eaten, just like I did.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">In doing so, the memories would be inherited, so whether or not the personality would change was simply not a matter of concern.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In other words, Milim-sama is not indestructible because she is not a True Dragon species. If you kill Milim-sama, you will incur the wrath of the resurrected Veldanava-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Testarossa summed up what Velgrynd had said. Perhaps, I think that&rsquo;s the right way to look at it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;All right, then, let&rsquo;s just warn Milim, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I said as such, and Velgrynd nodded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then she turned to Masayuki, who was sitting next to her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You look like someone else, but&hellip;Masayuki, you&rsquo;re definitely a target, so you have to be very careful, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eh?!

Your Majesty yourself must be more aware of this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;O-Okay&hellip;uh, I mean, I understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Masayuki&rsquo;s lame-ass reply brought the afternoon&rsquo;s discussions to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dinner was sumptuous.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a full course meal of Italian cuisine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We started with a soup of beets&mdash;rather, a vegetable similar to beets&mdash;followed by gizzard confit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After zeppolines</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c2">, we were served couscous with various vegetables and a lightly roasted medium-fatty Spearhead Armored Fish.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everything was absolutely divine, but it didn&rsquo;t stop there.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Savory panna cotta with prawn, battleship fish involtini</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c2">, and spaghetti with fortress crabs were added to the superb menu.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I took a break with the mushroom risotto, the seafood soup arrived.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The soup, from which the extracts of all the seafood of the day had been extracted, was a wonderful dish that changed flavor with each sip. The soup was made by simmering various soups for more than half a day and mixing them together.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was no exaggeration to say that this dish was made by the thoughtfulness of the chefs, and it was a hidden masterpiece that could be eaten only once a year.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And finally, the main dish of the day.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a veal deer fillet steak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I cut it gently with a knife and placed it in my mouth. The tender meat melted before I could even finish biting into it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Delicious.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seriously, it&rsquo;s so delicious!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as we finished eating, Benimaru and I gave each other a high five.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no need to exchange words, and that was enough.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Normally, we would have a lively conversation during the meal, but everyone was quiet today. I felt that this was a sign of satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the white wine yogurt was served for dessert, everyone finally started to talk about their impressions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is this deliciousness?! As an imperial aristocrat myself, I was proud to have tasted countless gourmet foods, but this is truly something else!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I understand. Even as a prisoner of war, I always looked forward to eating here, and I&rsquo;ve never felt more blissful than I do today. Thank you, Your Majesty Rimuru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;To be honest, if I can eat like this, I&rsquo;d be happy to be Emperor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also learned how to cook, but this is impossible for me. There&rsquo;s nothing wasted, and the food has been thoughtfully prepared with the eater in mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Imperials were raving about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dwargon&rsquo;s side was not to be outdone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru, it seems that your cooking has improved here. Shuna-dono, was it? I&rsquo;d like to invite you to my country to teach us a few recipes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I prefer drinking to eating, but this is different. The portions small enough that it makes you want to eat more. It&rsquo;s all very well thought out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s calculated, but I agree that I wanted to eat more of each dish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! It was so delicious, I almost left for the next world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean, Jaine-dono? You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s eating everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you talking about, Anrietta? You&rsquo;re eating the same amount of food as I am!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? Even if you notice something like that, it&rsquo;s good manners not to point it out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Basically, it seems that people were satisfied as long as the drinks are good, so I wanted to make them happy with the food as well. Thanks to Shuna and the others, I was able to achieve that goal this time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Incidentally, Shion and Diablo were in normal operation even in such a situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo was serving us, pouring us drinks, and Shion was standing upright as a guard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But I know.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shuna told me secretly that Shion was always eating and drinking in the name of poison testing. This time, she even took another bite to eat, so I didn&rsquo;t have to worry that she might get hungry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We took a moment of relaxation after dinner.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The location changed to the common room, and we all enjoyed chatting over a cup of coffee.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While we were chatting about the food and other small talk, Gazel suddenly spoke to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;By the way, Rimuru, there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been bothering me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something you did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Um&hellip;what&hellip;??&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Benimaru-dono and the other executives there&mdash;you&rsquo;re the one who made them evolve, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ah, that&rsquo;s a sign towards being reprimanded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wish he&rsquo;d stop saying things out of the blue like that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get hit, but at least give me some time to think of an excuse beforehand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was prepared, but Gazel smiled and continued.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so nervous. I&rsquo;m not angry. I paled when Jaine told me about it, but now I understand that it was necessary.&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Phew.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was relieved that he didn&rsquo;t seem upset.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But explaining it to the rest of the world will be tricky, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t thought of that? The Western Nations, the Western Holy Church, Sarion, and the rest of the human world must have been paying attention to this war.

I&rsquo;ll listen to you properly next time, so I&rsquo;ll come over to play again, haha.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">So, there was nothing for Gazel to worry about.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;El-tan?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel shouted at the top of his lungs.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And now he was staring at me with a look of disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Huh?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Was there anything surprising in what I just said?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid! How did you get so close to that Emperor?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, I&rsquo;m pretty good at that kind of thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No matter how difficult someone is, you can always start with a conversation. And the most important thing is to have a good understanding of what the other person wants to say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the past, when I was working as a supervisor at a construction site, there were nearby residents who always made absurd complaints. However, by listening to them calmly, the problems were able to be solved surprisingly easily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, there are also times when there is nothing one can do.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In those cases, just listening is good enough.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Always keep listening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By doing so, the other person will feel closer to you, convinced that you can understand them, and gradually accept you.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That, or you can just bide your time and wait for the problem to be solved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this case, there&rsquo;s no need to do anything in particular, just listen to the complaints and keep the conversation going. This makes the other person feel more intimate, and it&rsquo;s overall a similar process.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, what was most important in my outlook of life was the way I treated others, and the way I communicated with them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had felt the same way when meeting Elmesia-san, and before I knew it, we had become friends.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Could it have been the alcohol?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve forgotten about that kind of thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Forgetting things that aren&rsquo;t beneficial to you is a good way to live. Of course, it&rsquo;s also very important to reflect on your mistakes so that you don&rsquo;t make them again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s a difficult thing to do, and I&rsquo;m still learning.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, how I did it is a secret, but we&rsquo;re good friends now, anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m not stupid enough to tell him about my drunken mistakes at the bar.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what I said, but it seems that Gazel was not convinced.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru, the Emperor of Sarion is a difficult person to meet, and waiting for an audience normally takes several months. Even if I apply from Dwargon, it takes half a year. That woman has a long lifespan, so a month is like a day in her eyes&hellip;and yet you&rsquo;re acting like it&rsquo;s easy to contact her?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, Your Majesty Rimuru! Sarion is also very important to our Empire. I did not expect this level of a connection&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even Calgurio and the others joined in on the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I asked them about it in detail, they told me that the Empire considered Sarion to be its greatest threat. It was speculated that they had a number of magical weapons that were yet to be seen, and that they had intended to save attacking Sarion for last.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Listening to Calgurio and Minits-san&rsquo;s explanation, Gazel nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even in the Western Nations, there were many nations that recognized Sarion&rsquo;s complexion, however, it was natural for them to react that way because Sarion was considered a military power that could swallow up the Western economic zone all on its own.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">And the ease with which I was able to have a direct conversation with the leader of such a great power without an appointment&hellip;even if I didn&rsquo;t know much about it, it really was a bit hard to believe.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But that said, it was all true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A-Ahahaha, well, you know, this? I guess I was lucky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm, it is only natural for Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Rather, it is the other party who should be grateful for their luck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo and Shion praised me from the sidelines, but I wished they would keep their mouths shut.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeing Gazel sigh deeply made me think it even more so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Minits-san unexpectedly seemed to agree with Shion and the others.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, if she saw through His Majesty Rimuru&rsquo;s true value, then indeed the emperor&rsquo;s reaction is understandable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That fearsome Celestial Empress would be able to pull off something like that without a second thought. Our empire has always thought that the country&rsquo;s magical warriors would not move out. If that had been the emperor&rsquo;s intention, she would have targeted our home country while Rimuru and the others were at a disadvantage. It was a close call.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was much more wary of Sarion than I thought he would be.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was quite relieved that we were getting along well because I hadn&rsquo;t expected Sarion to be such a dangerous country.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">El-tan had invited me to come visit next time, so I would be sure to pay her a visit and learn more about things then.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this information was also kept secret, but how far did the Intelligence Bureau get&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No. Unfortunately, I hadn&rsquo;t heard of this either. Well, it&rsquo;s still a long time ago for me, so perhaps I just forgot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd was happily denying Minits-san&rsquo;s statement. She seemed to be very vindictive, and I was pretty sure she remembered everything, even if it was a long time ago.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, is there something you want to say to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;N-No, it&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scary, it&rsquo;s like she read my mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This kind of person is dangerous, so I would try not to offend them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even so, I was shocked that they were so surprised by my connection with Elmesia-san. This was&hellip;I guess it was best to keep the fact that Myourmiles-kun was also a comrade a secret between us.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With everything from the &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages&rsquo; going on, it would be better to be careful about letting things slip.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I made a secret vow to do so, and the night continued on.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next morning, Gazel and his group left.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Calgurio and the rest of their group, in accordance with the agreed plan, began to prepare for their return.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The work was still in progress, but the construction would be handed over to Adalmann&rsquo;s men. There were some who wanted to stay in the country, but they were persuaded to give priority to the stability of the empire first before thinking about immigration.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In less than a week, the preparations were completed, and they were scheduled to depart.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, the remaining problems were identified, countermeasures were devised, and the status quo was confirmed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were no problems on the Imperial side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We would just have to wait for word from Testarossa, taking a wait-and-see approach, until the situation changed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Dwarven Kingdom was a bit worried.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If a seraph-level enemy appeared, Gazel and the others would have a difficult time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the city of Dwargon, which was like a natural fortress, was equipped with multiple magical defenses. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to break through them, so they could just contact us whenever something happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had also given Gazel a cell phone, so he could use it in the case of an emergency.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And one more thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I decided to send Agera over to Gazel&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gazel had told me that he wanted to re-train himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Agera had also asked to go out for a while to calm her mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She said she had a lot to worry about and mull over.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Carrera had no hesitation in saying that Agera could do as she pleased.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for me, knowing Agera&rsquo;s situation, I was at a loss as to how to respond. I accepted the suggestion, thinking that time was of the essence here.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With this, even Dwargon could withstand an endurance battle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, it would be best if nothing went wrong, but if something did happen, they could still manage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Kingdom of Farmenas, where Youm and the others were, had also been dealt with.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Diablo sent Gadra to explain the situation. He hadn&rsquo;t had a private meeting with me, so he had left two days ago.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gadra also had a role as a guardian of the labyrinth, but there was no Demon Colossus.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was not even a remnant of the wreckage, so we had to build it from scratch.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The researchers seemed to have rejoiced because there were some new functions they were excited to try.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was not easy on my wallet to pay for the materials, but I asked them to make a satisfactory product since the government treasury would be paying for it this time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since there was still some time before the completion of the project, it was agreed that he would stay in Farmenas for the time being.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the Kingdom of Blumund and the Western Nations&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cien was there, and I also sent Zonda for support. The demons are basically capable of &lsquo;Spatial Transportation,&rsquo; so they should be able to handle most situations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t think it made strategic sense to target us from these locations, so I didn&rsquo;t plan to take any further measures.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t think so, but if the enemy ever committed an act of human genocide, Guy wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He wouldn&rsquo;t want the human race to perish, so he would be sure to take action.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And then there was Luminas.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the situation was not serious enough for Guy to make a move, Luminas and the Holy Knight Order would take care of the situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;Three Drunk Sages&rdquo; had been informed of the situation, so Glenda and the others would be working behind the scenes. Depending on the situation, we decided that we could do something by stalling for time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Incidentally, I had also given Glenda a cell phone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t for personal use, but just as a means of communication between the Three Drunk Sages and us.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because of this phone, we could respond immediately if something happened. So it was just a matter of settling down and waiting for word from the Western Nations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The question that remained was whether or not there would be any unintended traitors.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&laquo;Regarding that, it is probably useless to think about it&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, no, it&rsquo;s not useless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There is a big difference between being prepared and not being prepared in the case of an emergency.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, while in the office, I began to think about the things that mattered most, while looking over the reports of the damage in each area.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I told Gazel and the others to watch out for anyone who had awakened an Angelic Ultimate Skill, but&hellip;he had looked at me with a face that seemed to have lost its expression.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, quietly, he said&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;Listen, Rimuru. In the first place, the Ultimate Skill is a secret. It is only a tradition that mentions that one was acquired by Gran Dwargo-sama, the first Hero King of the dwarves, yet it is so important that its authenticity is unknown. Not many people know if it was true, not even Vaughn and Dolph! And yet, you&hellip;don&rsquo;t talk to me like it&rsquo;s just normal to have them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the end, I was scolded, but I was told that this was the common sense of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, the number of people who even knew about the existence of Ultimate Skills was extremely small. The reality is that there was currently no way to find out if anyone possessed an angelic type among them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was too much to worry about, so I decided to ignore it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Or at least I did.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I calmed down and reconsidered the situation, I realized that there were some people who were unexpectedly close to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the very least, Guy and Luminas were certain to have one</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Leon&rsquo;s strength was also extraordinary, so I think he might have one as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I didn&rsquo;t know about Dagruel, but even Dino had one, so I think it was better to assume that he had one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, speaking of Dagruel&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I recall that Luminas, from what she had heard about the future from Chloe, said that Dagruel would take advantage of the Empire to start a war. However, that didn&rsquo;t seem to be the case this time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Was there a reason for this, or was he being influenced by someone?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If it was Michael&rsquo;s doing, then we could take countermeasures. I think we needed to have a proper discussion about this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What about Milim?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Maybe it&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t know, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there was something.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m sure Milim would tell me what was going on, and I&rsquo;m also curious about Karion and Frey-san&rsquo;s conditions. I should go and talk to them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just as I was thinking about all this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;&lsquo;Can you hear me? We are having a Walpurgis right now. I know it&rsquo;s sudden, but I need everyone to attend. That is all.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Suddenly, a voice echoed in my head.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rather&hellip;this was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I turned my gaze to my fingertips and saw a ring shining at the base of my right pinky finger. It was a ring I had forgotten I was even wearing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the demon lord&rsquo;s ring that I had received when I became a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is to say, the voice coming out belonged to Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I hadn&rsquo;t used it at all until now, so I must have forgotten that it had such a function.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, this was not the time to be thinking about these things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shion, go get Shuna.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I looked at Diablo as Shion ran off happily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Guy. It seems that we&rsquo;ll be holding a Walpurgis right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not like Guy to do things without prior notice. It&rsquo;s a bit incomprehensible that Guy personally contacted someone in the first place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s what bothered me, too.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was a prideful man who was always calm in his way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was to the point that even his men were not allowed to talk to him&hellip;I had a bad feeling about this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was told that you wanted to see me. I am here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rimuru, it&rsquo;s a big deal! Something definitely must have happened if Guy actually contacted us himself!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shuna entered the room, but Ramiris, who hadn&rsquo;t even been called, also came along. Not only Beretta, but Treyni-san was there with her as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Come to think of it, she was also a demon lord, so it was only natural that Ramiris had a demon lord&rsquo;s ring as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris told me that it was rare for Guy to organize Walpurgis.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There seemed to have been a time in the past when Ramiris, Milim, and Guy were the only three demon lords, but nothing of the sort had happened in over a thousand years.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, since it was all happening right now, it was definitely an emergency.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is what I wanted to talk about, Shuna. I don&rsquo;t have time to explain in detail, but I will be taking Shion and Diablo with me to Walpurgis. Tell Benimaru to take care of things while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shuna nodded wisely as I said this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood. Good luck, Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I nodded and got ready.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then I waited quietly for the pickup.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Soon, the blue-haired Raine, dressed in a dark red maid&rsquo;s uniform, jumped through space to reveal herself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris had given her permission to enter the labyrinth, but her sudden appearance was still unsettling.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, right now was not the time to worry about that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because Raine was covered with wounds.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, I realized that my bad premonition had come true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Raine-chan, are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the hell&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ramiris and I asked in surprise, but Raine quietly shook her head.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I will explain everything to you once we&rsquo;re all together, so please move along for now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had no words to reply after hearing that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I did as I was told, and Raine led me away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon arriving at our destination, we would be confronted with new problems.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c33"><span class="c24">Epilogue<br>Guy Crimson</span></h1><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He arose a long time ago, far back in the ages, before the creation of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His birth was a mere coincidence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava, the creator god, created the seven seraphim from the Great Spirit of Light, and the shadows were born.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those were the Seven Primordials&mdash;devil lords derived from the Great Spirit of Darkness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was the first of them, and he was the king who ruled the underworld, the world of darkness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Since his birth, his power had been absolute, the embodiment of darkness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An arrogant king who could control the demons at will.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From his perspective, even his seven separate brothers and sisters of darkness were no more than like those of his many family members (dependents).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Once in a bid for supremacy, when two of the primordials teamed up to challenge him, he subdued the two to the ground without a second thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To him, it was nothing but mere child&rsquo;s play, but one thing did become clear at that time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That is, the &lsquo;primordials&rsquo; were immortal. However, if they were crushed to the core, they would be resurrected in subordination to the victor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As mental organisms, they were subjugated to their opponents once defeated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With the discovery of this fact, the remaining four primordials fell into a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was one particular primordial who persistently troubled him, but his fate had been sealed once he was summoned to earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whether it was a coincidence that he was called to earth or not&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no way to confirm it now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, it is true that it changed his fate drastically.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Having been summoned, he looked around.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had spent all his time in peace in the underworld, and had no connection to the flow of time that passed on earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In a world that he thought was just beginning, civilization had already developed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Instantly, he understood that he had been summoned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was magic, a technique that rewrote the laws of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The power he had when he was in the Underworld was limited, and he could only exert the power of a newborn archdemon. Even so, it was enough for him, though it was inconvenient to be without a body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He wondered why this was happening, and soon understood.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was a semi-material world, not a realm of spiritual beings. In a space that was not filled with magicules, simply staying there would consume energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He, who had no connection with the creator god, did not understand how the world had been transformed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Very interesting,&rsquo; he thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, he felt uncomfortable by the presence of someone who was screaming something in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no one who would dare do such a reckless and foolish thing in front of him, the strongest in the Underworld.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was why he felt like putting up with him for a while.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The wizard who had summoned him spoke very pompously.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The language is the first language, the magic language. Therefore, he understood it without any effort.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He listened to him patiently and found that he was saying some very interesting things.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were countries in this world competing for supremacy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were elves, dwarves, beastmen, vampires, and humans. It seems that various races had been born and were competing for survival.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The wizard was a high human.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;You are now my servant. Follow my orders in accordance with the principles of the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The man spoke arrogantly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In order for the Super Magic Empire to unite the world, he was ordered to destroy the warring nations that were vying for supremacy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was very easy for him to do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The war, which had lasted a hundred years, came to an end upon his arrival.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All he had to do was to cast a single spell.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That magic was the forbidden nuclear magic: Death Streak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rampage of this large-scale destructive magic, which destroyed even the soul, transformed the largest nation with a population of over a million into a city of death.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To him, this was a natural occurrence, and was irrelevant to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, there was one interesting change.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He realized that he was awakening, having acquired the souls of a large number of people. As a result, he has succeeded in incarnating using a million corpses.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even the drowsiness he felt for the first time was pleasant, and it was a pleasure to fight against it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This event would be the birth of the world&rsquo;s first True Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As he gained power, he realized that he had escaped the spell that bound him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It would have been an easy spell to destroy, but it was disappointing that it had burst without him doing anything.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apparently, his awakening began when he had reaped the souls of about 10,000 humans. His race restriction had been lifted, and he had become a demon peer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even so, his power was still less than 10% of what he could wield in the underworld, but it was enough to become an unrivaled presence on earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He wondered with interest what would happen if he gathered a larger number of souls.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were some who were just perfect for the experiment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Those who had thrown all the chores at him should return the favor accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He returned to the first city and killed everyone in sight one by one. He refrained from using mass destruction spells so as not to involve the man he was after.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, he felt the screams of the dying being etched into his soul.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Giiyaaa!!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Screams like this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing this, he suddenly thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Yes, perhaps that is a good &lsquo;name&rsquo; for me.</span><sup class="c4 c20 c22 c31"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And that was that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The change was dramatic.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy had evolved further.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He became a &ldquo;devil lord&rdquo; and regained all the power he had when he was in the Underworld.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The souls he acquired had given him strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The maximized vessel was filled to the brim, and his magicule amount was fully restored.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But that was where the changes ended.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At that point, there was no meaning for Guy to work anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He summoned the two pillars (primordials) that followed him and gave them orders.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Wipe out the Super Magic Empire from the face of the earth.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was feeling very generous now that he had awakened as a demon lord and gained a name.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even that insignificant wizard wasn&rsquo;t worth his trouble to torment, and was even wiped from his memory.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;H-How?! How did you escape from my secret arts&hellip;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Guy didn&rsquo;t even pay any mind to him. It was the wizard&rsquo;s good fortune that he was killed by the demons without understanding anything.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On that day, tens of thousands of years ago, the largest and most powerful nation in the history of mankind, which had been caught in a divisive struggle, disappeared from the earth with ease.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two pillars summoned by Guy had, after all, deteriorated to the level of archdemons.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was the law of this world. When one crosses from the underworld to the semi-material world, they lose most of their power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Crossing the world was no problem for a spiritual life form, but in this world, even just maintaining an existence was extremely draining.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Therefore, they needed a physical body.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only by incarnating and evolving could they take root in this world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Understanding this, Guy waited for his followers to evolve.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But strangely enough, no matter how many human souls he collected, the two of them never evolved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So he gave them the honor of incarnating a corpse.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That act alone was the best evidence that Guy was in a very good mood.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two pillars were the Green Primordial (Vert) and a Blue Primordial (Bleu).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Their forms were of two beautiful women.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Looking at them kneeling in front of him, Guy pondered.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There was no point in even incarnating if there was no way to further strengthen them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They could be trusted with miscellaneous tasks, but their power was too fragile.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So Guy decided to be generous and give them names.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Remembering that he himself had evolved with a name, he thought that the two of them might evolve in the same way.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I will give you a name.

That is the eternal and immortal truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, the three of them continued their journey.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the same time, Mizeri and Raine were summoning their own dependents and secretly building up a sphere of influence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All in order to provide Guy, the ruler, with all the wealth and pleasures of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike life in the underworld, where one spent all their time fighting and refining the strength of their soul, this world was full of excitement.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no stagnation, and it was constantly developing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cooking, music, performing arts, dance, fine arts, and many other things kept Guy and his friends interested.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t this kind of thing fun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy, who was dancing at a festival in a minority village, smiled at Mizeri and Raine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Faced with the rare smile of their Lord, Mizeri and Raine&rsquo;s joy reached its peak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How wonderful.

If this rate of growth continues, the world will be doomed in less than a few thousand years. Humans are fallible creatures.

That was indeed ugly. If it had been left unchecked, the world might have been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was convinced, but one question remained.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm.

Why do you need to rely on me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahahaha, because I am not omniscient nor omnipotent. When I was born, all I had was my will. At that time, I was satisfied. The world was perfect and lacked nothing when I was the only one&mdash;in other words, it was boring, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">I see</span><span class="c2">, Guy thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He understood.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava had given up being &lsquo;omniscient and omnipotent&rsquo; by his own free will.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Of course he did. It would be so boring to be able to see all the outcomes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In light of his own experience, he found it boring to only fight battles that he could win.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the Underworld, everyone was afraid of Guy, except for one person.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Any demon who wanted to challenge him to a fight had long since disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even Guy, who was no match for Veldanava, was afraid of him, so it was no wonder that this god had abandoned his omniscience.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate this world, so I&rsquo;m gonna help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No need to hesitate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy also loved this world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Regardless of servitude, Guy was genuinely willing to help.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava nodded happily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you.

So, what do you want me to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stay put. You can roam the world as you are, or you can set up your base and reign.

Eventually, they became villages, and the villages gathered and grew into nations.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a poor civilization compared to the super civilization of the past, but the magic and technology that had been passed down in secret were recreated, and it developed at a reasonably fast pace.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was interesting to see how humans worked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before long, a number of nations were born, and once again, small-scale skirmishes began to take place.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy wondered if he should take action, but instead of worrying about it, he decided to just do it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a warning, he wiped out any country he saw.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">People feared Guy as a visible threat&mdash;the demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In response to this threat, they cultivated a spirit of unity.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">That&rsquo;s fine. As long as it doesn&rsquo;t get on my nerves, I won&rsquo;t destroy you.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a &ldquo;mediator,&rdquo; Guy was satisfied with his work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the meantime, Mizeri and Raine had taken control of a great power with their men. They defeated the local gods, demons, and majins, and steadily gained recognition.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mizeri also began to infiltrate human society and engage in espionage. By scrutinizing the information he obtained, he was able to uncover those who needed to be purged.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The purpose was to create a sense of tension in human society by instilling a moderate level of fear.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;demon lord&rdquo; was established as a system.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, there was nothing for Guy to do.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He wandered the world and enjoyed fighting at will.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even Veldanava&rsquo;s followers, the Seven Heavens</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c2">, had difficulty in subduing the giants.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The battle against Ivarage, the World-destroying Dragon commissioned by Veldanava, was also a pleasure. His fighting instincts were fierce, much to Guy&rsquo;s satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were problems, though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were so close in strength that they had to fight for three months. Moreover, he eventually escaped to the other world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also, as a result of Guy&rsquo;s rampage, the land had become a wasteland as far as the eye could see.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He had learned a valuable lesson&mdash;Next time you get serious, you need to think about where you&rsquo;re fighting.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy looked over the continent from above.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then he spotted a castle that looked familiar to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the Imperial Castle of the Super Magic Empire, the place where Guy had been summoned to this world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking that this was some kind of destiny, Guy decided to make the castle his home.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Raine quickly dispatched her men to create a livable environment. With the help of magic, the castle was rebuilt in no time at all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And then.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A white dragon challenged Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a beautiful dragon with blue diamond eyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t know what she misunderstood, but her first words were belligerent&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My brother may approve of you, but I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;and then she attacked Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy had learned his lesson from before and understood how to choose his battles depending on the strength of his opponent. Nevertheless, the dragon sent a blizzard of ice and snow above the castle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, there was no time to worry about the damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Those who survived had already evacuated and the castle could always be rebuilt. Raine and her subordinates would have a difficult time, but that didn&rsquo;t matter to Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was frustrated because he Ivarage, the World-destroying Dragon, had escaped. With the appearance of a new enemy, he was in a high mood.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wanting to have some fun, Guy took his opponent seriously.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Despite his best efforts, the battle could not come to an end.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The dragon was Velzard the Frost Dragon, sister of Veldanava the Star King Dragon and eldest sister of the True Dragon Race.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the time, she had the second greatest amount of magicules after Veldanava, and even Guy was unable to defeat her.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, in Velzard&rsquo;s opinion, Guy was the one who was the anomaly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After all, Guy only had the Unique Skill. For Velzard, who had been given the angelic Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Patience King Gabriel&rsquo; by Veldanava, a draw should have been an absolutely impossible result.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why are you an even match for me when you&rsquo;re only on the unique level?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous! My brother gave this power to me, not you. That&rsquo;s supposed to be proof that I&rsquo;m more useful than you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not quite right. He offered me his power, but I refused. I would&rsquo;ve accepted it if I chose to become his servant, but I wanted to be on equal footing with him. So I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wanting to be recognized by her brother, Velzard jealously challenged Guy. And it was right there in front of her that Guy demonstrated the evolution of his power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeing Veldanava&rsquo;s power had given him a kick in the pants. And now, through the fight with Velzard, he understood just what an Ultimate Skill was.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is how I&rsquo;m going to get to the ultimate level through my own strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And at that moment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Unique Skill &lsquo;Pride&rsquo; evolved into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Pride King Lucifer.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Velzard saw this, she was speechless.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well&hellip;I guess that&rsquo;s why my brother likes you so much. In that case, I&rsquo;ll keep watching to see how far you&rsquo;ll take yourself, right up until the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seems that Velzard&rsquo;s real purpose was to test Guy. It was unclear whether he passed or not, but the two of them had been moving forward together ever since.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was how Guy and Velzard met.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After three days and three nights of fighting, even the earth&rsquo;s axis had shifted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But this time, Guy had made exquisite changes. The permafrost, which had been uninhabitable until now, had been turned into a land of everlasting spring. In its place, the continent Guy had chosen as his base had become an uninhabitable frozen ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s acceptable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Guy-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There should be no problem. There was some damage to mankind as well, but with all nations working together to deal with the natural disaster, casualties were kept to a minimum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For the people who lived there, it was a disaster. But to Guy, it was nothing more than a laughing matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for Raine and Mizeri, as long as Guy was happy, they were happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy&rsquo;s castle, which had been covered with ice in the aftermath of the battle, had turned out to be beautiful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. Let&rsquo;s keep it as a memento.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take care of it. I can at least help you with this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The temperature in the surrounding area dropped to an extreme level due to the demonic energy leaking from the Velzard. From then on, the castle had become too frigid for the weak to invade.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Living in the castle, Velzard&rsquo;s dragon form was inconvenient.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Guy pointed this out, Velzard easily transformed into human form.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In her adult form, Velzard had complete control over her youki, but instead, she chose to maintain a slightly younger form.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, the youki that leaked out would become cold air, and the castle&rsquo;s defense would be perfect.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although, there was no one who would attack the castle in the extreme cold, where not even monsters could easily survive&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s good, though it&rsquo;s not my style.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Jeez! You&rsquo;re so mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velzard complained outwardly, but deep down, she was actually quite fond of Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Deep in her heart, she secretly vowed that one day she would win Guy over with her charm.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hundreds of years had passed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The days had been unchanging, but one day was different than usual.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy, bored out of his mind, had a visitor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a party of three people.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">That small group breezed through the harsh cold where no one could enter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was interested and watched them closely.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed young man standing at the front of the group shouted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am Rudra Nasca, the crown prince of the Nasca Kingdom and the &lsquo;hero&rsquo; of all the people&rsquo;s hopes! You evil demon lord, I will destroy you with my sword! Also, give me all the treasures you are rumored to be hoarding!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 789.27px; height: 1122.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.jpg" style="width: 789.27px; height: 1122.53px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a declaration that was far from noble.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But, on the contrary, Guy liked this unabashed desire.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Brother Rudra, I can&rsquo;t tell which one of you is the demon lord when you act like this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re really no good, Rudra. You&rsquo;re already blinded by greed. If you want money, I can just earn it for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Honestly! Sister Gryn, please stop spoiling Brother Rudra. If this continues, he will surely suffer the consequences of his failure!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Right in front of Guy, the three of them were having this kind of conversation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Was this bravery or stupidity?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only one thing was for certain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Standing before Guy meant that they had defeated Mizeri and Raine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that was the case, then this ridiculous trio possessed a considerable level of strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also, Guy saw that one of the three had the same presence as his friend and partner. That&rsquo;s why he couldn&rsquo;t blame Mizeri or Raine for their defeats.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This, like the laws of nature, was only the expected ending.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What he was more concerned about was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;Hero?&rsquo; What&rsquo;s that?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the first time he had heard that word, and it sounded so sweet.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It gave Guy the feeling that his boredom would soon melt away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy happily turned to the young man who called himself Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Interesting. Let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;re made of, &lsquo;Hero!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy decided to accept Rudra&rsquo;s challenge.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmph! I&rsquo;m the strongest, and don&rsquo;t need any help. Demon lord, I will fight you fair and square, let&rsquo;s go one on one!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was handsome, but his smile was a bit vulgar.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seems that his goal was not to defeat Guy, but rather to snatch the treasures.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">But that was what Guy thought made him truly human.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Without desire, people would not work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was the desire for a better life that drove people to work hard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was truly a human being.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A human being with the type of sweet emotions that Guy loved.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! Let&rsquo;s see what you can do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And then the battle began.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy watched as Rudra approached him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a sharp and fast blow, but it was not serious at all. The fact that he was taking a chance on him was irritating to Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was protected by an elaborate full-body magic armor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seemed to be quite expensive, so Guy decided to destroy it first.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As someone who seemed greedy for money, he probably would not like to have his belongings destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In short, the point was to harass him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He evaded Rudra&rsquo;s sword with ease, and cross kicked him in the side with a feint that looked like a knee kick.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was trying to avoid it just in time, so he couldn&rsquo;t react to the feint, and his armor was shattered.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ahhhhh!! A year&rsquo;s worth of national budget armor is&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you okay, Brother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rudra is such an idiot. If we had all fought together from the start, the armor wouldn&rsquo;t have been destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! This&mdash;This is a necessary expense!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra became teary-eyed, so it must have been more effective than he thought. Guy realized this and smirked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Next time, I&rsquo;ll smash his sword and make him cry.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking this, Guy observed the three of them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Brother! At least let me use some support magic&mdash;Holy Blade!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The platinum-pink-haired girl, whom Guy had initially judged to be the most harmless of the three, performed an outrageous magic.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The sword Rudra was holding began to glow.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a jaw-dropping divine, evil-destroying light.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">That&rsquo;s not good. That light seems to have the power to cut through my Barrier.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He should have stopped it before it was launched, but Guy was enjoying this fight, so it would have been tactless to interfere.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh, if I just think of it as my sister cheering me on, then it&rsquo;s acceptable&mdash;but Lucia, you can&rsquo;t do anything else!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was more concerned with results rather than pride.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was not ashamed to accept help from his sister.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">This guy, what a character.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While not yet at the point of crisis, the situation was certainly worsening.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet, for some reason, Guy was enjoying it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not even a handicap. If you want, you can all come at me together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Take things seriously! I&rsquo;m getting serious from here on out, so prepare yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was as honest as he said he was, hiding his abilities. The speed of his sword increased, and he closed in on Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy had seen this coming.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He laughed and picked up his beloved sword, &lsquo;Tenma,&rsquo; just for the fun of it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah? What kind of demon lord uses a weapon like that? How dirty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? I don&rsquo;t know what your values are, but I&rsquo;ll give you credit for making me pull out my sword.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In fact, Rudra&rsquo;s swordplay was brilliant, and it was natural for him to use a sword, since even Guy would be hurt if he touched it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was a proud man, but he had no interest in going easy on him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! I&rsquo;m not happy to be praised by a demon lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see. Then I won&rsquo;t praise you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;Wait, I&rsquo;ll keep listening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was actually pretty happy to be praised.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not only did you make me draw my sword, but there&rsquo;s only a handful of people who can actually fight with me. Rudra, wasn&rsquo;t it? You should be proud that I remembered your name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was in a good mood, so he complied with Rudra&rsquo;s request.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra smiled happily and responded to Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty good too. I didn&rsquo;t expect the demon lord to pass over my evil-destroying sword. Thanks for remembering my name. I&rsquo;ll take your name too before I destroy you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite arrogant for a human, but I like you, so I&rsquo;ll tell you. When you get to the Underworld, you can tell them my name.

How is that a name?! If I defeated a Demon Lord with such a funny name, it would be so uncool.

The name doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How can it not matter?!

I&rsquo;ll come up with a better name for you first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that, Rudra stopped fighting without permission.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy had no reason to obey him, but there was no way he was going to kill off a rare fun time with a sneak attack. Since he wanted to have some real fun anyway, he decided to accept Rudra&rsquo;s offer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Besides, I&rsquo;m a little interested.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra and his group started discussing in a circle.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;His hair is a beautiful red color&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait a minute, if you&rsquo;re talking about red, then that&rsquo;s just like me who is the &lsquo;cardinal.&rsquo; That is non-negotiable, okay?&rdquo;</span><sup class="c19 c4"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know!

No way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huhuhu, don&rsquo;t worry, Rudra.

Is it really okay to have a demon lord be name by a hero? The people might be worried that you have become so familiar with each other.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay! No one is watching, and if we don&rsquo;t tell them, then they won&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t Guy&rsquo;s place to interfere, but Rudra seemed to have a rather sloppy personality.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was enough to make Guy realize that, and he became more worried the more he listened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you get your story straight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting!

It was obviously taboo to name a monster, but he selfishly decided that it would be fine because he was a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Instead of magicules, Rudra&rsquo;s spiritual power was greatly depleted, and he wandered between life and death.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Needless to say, Rudra&rsquo;s sister Lucia and his lover Velgrynd, the Scorch Dragon, were very angry with him after he woke up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, the showdown with Guy was lost&hellip;This was the moment when the strange fate of Guy and Rudra was born.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He waited for Rudra to recover and resume the duel as promised.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the outcome was never decided.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And after that, Guy and Rudra dueled many more times.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Worthy of being the self-proclaimed hero, Rudra was very strong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra, the awakened hero, and Guy, the awakened demon lord.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra, the technically brilliant, and Guy, who fought only with his strength and talent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fights were close, but it was only natural that Guy would gradually gain the upper hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were three women who looked blankly at these two men with dismay.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were Lucia, Velgrynd, and Velzard, the Frost Dragon.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velzard seemed uninterested at first, but as the fights grew more heated, she began to enjoy the competition.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, it looks like Guy&rsquo;s getting stronger again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, Sister.

He&rsquo;s strong of course. Rudra is the apprentice of Elder Brother after all. He&rsquo;s been given her ultimate power, so he&rsquo;ll grow even stronger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh? That makes sense. Then, I&rsquo;m convinced.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As for me, I think it&rsquo;s best if no one gets hurt&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like this, the spectators were peacefully at ease.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The tea is ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The winner will be decided soon, so we&rsquo;ve prepared tea for Guy-sama and Rudra-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was Mizeri and Raine&rsquo;s job to serve them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At some point, this had become an everyday thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On other days, fights broke out between the sisters that made it impossible to compete.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velzard and Velgrynd were on good terms, but sometimes they disagreed over the direction of education.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Their newborn brother, Veldora the Storm Dragon, seemed to be very capricious and was constantly running amok.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the reason for the conflict&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&mdash;Sister is too strict! Why can&rsquo;t he be pampered more?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I care about Veldora-chan and I love him very much! In order to make him more mature and stable, I&rsquo;ve had to clean him up a few times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velzard&rsquo;s words about &ldquo;cleaning him up&rdquo; was the ridiculous method of physically disposing of Veldora and reincarnating him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Velgrynd didn&rsquo;t like that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that you are wrong about all this! You have to tell him with words, and not with violence.

As always, Velgrynd-chan is so naive. In that case, why don&rsquo;t we just beat him half to death from now on so he can become more knowledgeable?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about that! I&rsquo;m talking about kindly teaching him more gently about how to live in the city as a person, and how to fight the enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Velgrynd-chan&hellip;I think it&rsquo;s better to say that you&rsquo;re more about spoiling than being sweet. You&rsquo;re the kind of person who ruins things by giving too much attention.

Rudra and I are the best of partners. Therefore, if I train Veldora, I know he&rsquo;ll grow up to be a great brother who respects his sisters.

This time it&rsquo;s my turn!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They blamed each other, saying that Velzard was too strict and that Velgrynd was too lenient.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy personally thought they were both to blame.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Moderation is best. The True Dragon sisters really don&rsquo;t understand the meaning of restraint, do they?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was unspokenly disgusted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;H-Hey, that&rsquo;s not our duel to deal with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah.

Even Veldanava-sama praised it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Overhearing the conversation, Guy was taken aback. The technique he had said he had gone through a great deal of trouble to learn was surprisingly easy for him to master.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy looked sideways at Rudra and let out a big sigh.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was still complaining that Guy was the dirty one for stealing people&rsquo;s skills, but he had his own reasons.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His words and actions were actually the result of Rudra&rsquo;s impatience.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although they were still on par in terms of ability, Rudra had been getting a bit overwhelmed lately. Rudra was more aware of this than anyone else, and thought that it would not be good if things continued as they were.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">If I could win in a fair fight, I would have done so too!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra wanted to say that out loud.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">What he said at first seemed to have nothing to do with things now, but the status quo was that he had to use all he had to win.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although Guy looked stunned, he saw right through Rudra&rsquo;s sentiment. Moreover, secretly, he was enjoying his quarrels with Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Therefore, Guy tolerated Rudra&rsquo;s tactics no matter what they were.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was also because Guy agreed with Rudra&rsquo;s belief that winning was justice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By now, Guy had accepted Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just knowing that there was someone who could compete with him was enough to make Guy happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was right, Guy&rsquo;s strength was growing the more he fought. The Ultimate Skill wasn&rsquo;t just something he acquired; it was something he could use to its full potential.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy learned this through his duels with Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although he was now fighting with only a sword to match Rudra, Guy was still beginning to overwhelm Rudra. If he added Skills and Magic to his arsenal, Guy would surely win.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet, Guy did not do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before he realized it, he had begun wanting a draw, and not a win.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why Guy welcomed Rudra&rsquo;s little tricks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But it was only a matter of time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus, Guy asked the question.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey&hellip;The first time you fought me, why didn&rsquo;t you all kill me then? If you hadn&rsquo;t named me then and really tried to kill me, you might have won, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was the question that Guy couldn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was too proud to admit that he might have lost. Admitting it would be tantamount to a defeat for a mental life form.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So for all this time, Guy tried not to think about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He did not think he was being merciful, nor did he want him to be.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If that was the answer, Guy might have killed Rudra in a fit of rage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just as Guy had &lsquo;Pride King Lucifer,&rsquo; Rudra had &lsquo;Justice King Michael.&rsquo; If Rudra had been serious from the beginning, it would not be clear who would have won.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There is no doubt that he would have been wounded, and there is no denying the possibility that Guy could have been defeated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At Guy&rsquo;s serious question, Rudra replied with a smile and a, </span><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;Oh, you mean that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot. There&rsquo;s no point in just beating you! I have to make you realize how great I am, so you&rsquo;ll change your mind and become one of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy couldn&rsquo;t understand, so he asked back again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fufu. I am the man who will conquer the world. That&rsquo;s what I promised my friend and mentor Veldanava, the Star King Dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy knew that Rudra was Veldanava&rsquo;s apprentice, he had said so himself, and he had no intention of doubting it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, he had no idea that Rudra had ambitions to conquer the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You know, Veldanava asked me to do a job for him, which was to stop idiots like you from trying to take over the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s why Veldanava asked me to find a way to gain your approval.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing that, Guy thought to himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Veldanava, you got tired of the trouble and just pushed it on to me!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s the answer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Show him what is reality&mdash;Guy could almost hear Veldanava telling him that.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra had been sent away by Veldanava to deal with Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Guy was already in Veldanava&rsquo;s clutches.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since he knows that he took a liking to Rudra, Guy had no choice but to go along with him until the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he didn&rsquo;t like Rudra, he would have killed him from the beginning, so now it was too late for him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Yeah, this guy&rsquo;s still an asshole.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra spoke to Guy, who was thinking in a good mood.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I mean, the truth is&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t control &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; with all my might during the first battle. Even now, I can only control it for a few dozen seconds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was a surprising admission, and Guy couldn&rsquo;t hide his surprise.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? You can&rsquo;t be serious, can you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s the truth. After all, this power is on loan from Veldanava.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra shrugged and began to speak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy listened to Rudra&rsquo;s story, and thought it felt irrelevant, he was convinced of Rudra&rsquo;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If it was a part of Veldanava&rsquo;s power, then it was no wonder that he was capable of defeating him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, as he listened to Rudra, he realized that there was a misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is a secret, but I&rsquo;ll tell it to you. What I&rsquo;ve acquired through my abilities is called &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel,&rsquo; which is the crystallization of my beliefs, my vow to unite the world, and the thoughts of my friends who responded to that vow. It is manifested as my ultimate skill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While he claimed to have done it on his own, he actually had help from Veldanava. Even so, it was quite amazing, and &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel,&rsquo; the embodiment of Rudra&rsquo;s heart, was of a higher power in the angelic system.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, I borrowed the &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; in exchange for it, but this was also troublesome. My &lsquo;Covenant King Uriel&rsquo; was simple and easy to use, with the powers to &lsquo;destroy&rsquo; and &lsquo;protect.&rsquo; But this &lsquo;Justice King Michael&rsquo; has the mysterious power of domination.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He could borrow the skills of those he had placed under his control and dominate the holders of those skills. It was a power fit for a king.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, in the current situation where there was no one under his control, the power was not very threatening. Rudra&rsquo;s strength was real because he was evenly matched with Guy despite that situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy said as such.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As the number of people he controlled increased, the number of powers he could use would also increase. Then, Rudra would become even more powerful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">What the heck? I thought that the differences in our strength would eventually become too different, leading to my sure victory&mdash;but it looks like this can still be enjoyed!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Looks like the fun would still continue.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was very happy to realize this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But then Rudra spoke.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not into dominating people. If I&rsquo;m a man, I want to compete only with my own strength. But sometimes there are circumstances that make it impossible to say that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Circumstances?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re a friend of Veldanava&rsquo;s, so you should have the right to know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing that made Guy feel uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He hadn&rsquo;t been seeing Veldanava lately, though he didn&rsquo;t care much because he was a long-lived species.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did something happen to that guy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s supposed to be a happy thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That guy and my sister, Lucia, were united. It&rsquo;s called marriage. Lucia&rsquo;s pregnant with Veldanava&rsquo;s child, so they&rsquo;re a real family now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A child, you say? A True Dragon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was truly an amazing story, that was sure.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Guy agreed that it was also possible for a being like Veldanava to seek imperfection as the &lsquo;all in one.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I suppose anything could happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. Well, if that was all, I&rsquo;d just congratulate them. But here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After that, Rudra told him something more important, making it impossible to stop at mere surprise. Guy couldn&rsquo;t help but stand up and ask Rudra, </span><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It seems that Veldanava had now become almost indistinguishable from human beings.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was also said to have laughed and told Rudra that he was now bound by a &ldquo;life span&rdquo; that he had never had to deal with before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The truth was too heavy for Rudra to simply brush away on his own.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s why he confided in Guy now.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like that guy, but what are you going to do&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been wondering about, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can&rsquo;t keep playing with you like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two couldn&rsquo;t help but look at each other and sigh at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop it! I like you, so I can&rsquo;t bring myself to kill you anyway, and I don&rsquo;t intend to fight you seriously now. However, to keep the world from falling apart, I will continue to be a demon lord. That&rsquo;s the promise I made to him, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy liked Rudra in the first place, and if he was a friend of Veldanava, then he was also a friend of his own.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was inevitable that he could not fight Rudra seriously from the start.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, he still had to do his job as a &ldquo;demon lord.&rdquo; That was the role Veldanava had asked him to play.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a &lsquo;mediator,&rsquo; he could not allow the scales of the world to tip.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Guy looked Rudra in the eye and said as such, Rudra also looked straight back at Guy and responded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, why don&rsquo;t we play a different game?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A different game, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra nodded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t smile coyly as usual, but instead began speaking with a serious expression.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. You and I won&rsquo;t be fighting directly. This time we will be using only our pawns to compete for world dominance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;To be honest, I don&rsquo;t want to use this &lsquo;Justice King Michael,&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t say that now. Veldanava gave me this power in support of my dream to unite the world. So I will continue to increase my men and will become stronger along with it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy nodded, agreeing with that assessment.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to kill you either. I told you, didn&rsquo;t I? I said that I&rsquo;d make you accept me. I want&mdash;no, I believe that the human race can be united. Veldanava wanted diversity, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to fight each other. People with different opinions should respect and get along with each other. If one can&rsquo;t accept the other person&rsquo;s opinion, then just pull away. Different races, different nations, if they are too armed, they will end up in war, but if they become a unified nation, they can settle everything through discussion, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, people are stupid, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know. But, you know, you and I get along, right? Even demon lords and heroes who were supposed to be each other&rsquo;s natural enemies can get along, so it should be easier for the same race to understand each other!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;There is no need for a mediator&rsquo; Rudra insisted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, Guy couldn&rsquo;t agree.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s naive. Humans are greedy creatures. It&rsquo;s not necessarily an evil thing, and that desire is necessary to pursue greater possibilities. That&rsquo;s why, as long as interests are at stake, even those who are close to each other will start fighting even amongst themselves. In this respect, the monster without wisdom knows better, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The magical creatures that evolved from animals into magical beasts would not kill again as long as their appetite was satisfied. They were not cunning and resourceful enough.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They would not think about securing food for tomorrow, but rather live each day with pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, humans were different.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Humans always thought about the future, became anxious, and tried to accumulate wealth so that they could withstand any situation. That was their natural instinct, and Rudra&rsquo;s vision of the world was a pipe dream.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was very difficult to lead people with words alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the first place, how difficult was it to convey one&rsquo;s true intentions in words to others without misunderstandings&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy understood this, which was why he felt that Rudra&rsquo;s dream would never come true.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, perhaps. I get it, and Veldanava laughed at me for being so idealistic, but&hellip;even so, I convinced him, and now he supports me. He told me, </span><span class="c6 c4">&lsquo;The probability is close to zero, but just do what you want.&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Between you and me, the Justice King has the power of the Army of Angels, &lsquo;Armageddon,&rsquo; and can summon an army of angels to destroy everything. I will use it to save people. I will destroy only military power and civilization and suppress the growing desires of men. At the same time, I will unify the world and build an ideal world for sure!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;So, cheer me on&rsquo;&mdash;Rudra asked Guy to support him.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Stop killing people, and value their potential.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m into slaughtering people. I just get rid of those I don&rsquo;t like. I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re a good guy or a bad guy. If I like them, I let them live. If I don&rsquo;t like them, I kill them. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. Just wait for a bit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hmph! I don&rsquo;t have the patience to wait for those who do harm to the world to realize their mistakes. </span><span class="c6 c4">Hate the sin, not the sinner?</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Punishment is necessary for sin, asshole. You should be held accountable for your actions!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I agree! But I want them to have a chance to change their ways.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hah! Then don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll just send the souls of the guilty to the underworld and give them a proper punishment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point, Rudra stopped narrating and carefully began to speak his mind once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to be some great king, I just want to make people smile. If there is a safe place to live and people to talk to, there will be fewer people who will commit crimes, right? I want to eliminate poverty and inequality, and create a world where everyone can live with a smile. That&rsquo;s what I want! Of course, there will be fools who can&rsquo;t help themselves, but I&rsquo;m going to try to make as few sacrifices as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra spoke of his ideals, not knowing that one day in the distant future, similar words would come from the mouth of one of his own opponents.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy, hearing this, shook his head in disgust.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No wonder Veldanava was laughing at you. I didn&rsquo;t know you were that naive. But&hellip;okay? Just tell me more about this game.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was bored anyway. It might be fun to play a game like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t that Guy had accepted Rudra&rsquo;s point of view.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He didn&rsquo;t want to deny Rudra&rsquo;s ideals, he just wanted to see how it ended. His stubborn friend would never be persuaded by words alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was trying to persuade others with words alone, even though he himself could not be. It was a contradiction in a sense, and it was only natural that he would fail.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When that happened, he supposed that Rudra would finally wake up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the chance that he succeeded, it would only mean less work for Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So no matter how things turned out, Guy decided that there would be no loss.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was also no particular benefit, but if Rudra was willing to give up his reckless plan, that was enough for Guy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is my ambition just a game to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra laughed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then he carefully explained the rules.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rules were simple.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Players keep their hands to themselves and only let their men compete.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other words, there was no direct confrontation between Guy and Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If all of Guy&rsquo;s men fell, Rudra would win. If that happened, Guy would follow Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But until that happened, Guy was free to do as he pleased. He was also free to fulfill his role as &ldquo;mediator&rdquo; in accordance with his agreement with Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There were few restrictions on Guy, but from Rudra&rsquo;s point of view, this was useful enough.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His original role as a Hero was to stop the demon lord, a threat to humanity and a regulator, from running amok.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy&rsquo;s thoughts were calm, but his power was too strong. Once he made a move, the damage would be too great.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra was there to prevent that from happening, but that would not fulfill his dream. He needed to stop Guy&rsquo;s movements in order to start working towards the unification of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After reading Rudra&rsquo;s intentions, Guy spoke.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fine. I promise I will not do anything. I&rsquo;ll gather up some demon lords to take my place and leave the direct punishment of mankind to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And I will stop them. I will unite the world before the demon lords take over!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a difficult road, isn&rsquo;t it? Even the good-natured Veldanava has given up on some of his ideals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava was not just a dreamer, but also a perfectionist. He had the rationality to perceive ideals as ideals and the unrealizable ones as unrealizable.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Veldanava&rsquo;s desire for change had led him to give up his omniscience and omnipotence, which made it no longer possible for him to realize his ideal society.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But for Veldanava, it was the right thing to do. He believed that a world that was completely at his disposal was not interesting at all.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was because he understood Veldanava&rsquo;s feelings that Rudra exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But even so! I want to make him feel assured. He is bound by his lifespan and has no more power than a normal human. And yet, he was so happy that he could even die with Lucia&hellip;But&hellip;But the truth is, he was worried about the future of this world! More than anything, he was worried about the future of their children&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I need to give him peace of mind and create a world where everyone can live happily, where he won&rsquo;t have to worry at all when he dies. And I want him to be satisfied that the world he created has matured into a wonderful, harmonious world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra swore to Veldanava that he would establish a unified nation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He also wished to make his sister Lucia happy and resolved to rid the world of all unhappiness.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let us decide the affairs of the human world with our own hands. You, who do not have a life expectancy, can be the judge and see things to the very end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to say in response to Rudra&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In his head, he determined that it was impossible. However, he could also understand Rudra&rsquo;s feelings, so he hesitated to say something negative.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">What the hell, asshole? Doesn&rsquo;t that just make you the one who has to carry all the responsibility&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He hated his mind for being so emotionally intelligent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy, although prideful, was kind to those he liked. That kindness was not enough to stop Rudra&rsquo;s reckless challenge.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy was at a loss for words to say to this foolish man who was also his beloved best friend.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">Your challenge is sure to fail.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy&rsquo;s brain calmly calculated the results.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The success rate was so low that it was ridiculous to even use the word &ldquo;probability&rdquo; to describe it. And yet, Rudra, whom Guy considered his best friend, would never give up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A Hero was someone with an unbreakable spirit, and Rudra was a true Hero who was willing to bear all hardships in order to realize the ideal world.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">That&rsquo;s why, if it was this guy, just maybe&mdash;Guy thought so.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was something about Rudra that made him think like that, and Guy bet on that tiny possibility.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">However, the result was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">*</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the start of the game between Guy and Rudra, many tragedies had occurred.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first tragedy occurred just after Veldanava and Lucia had their child&mdash;Milim.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A terrorist attack took place in the Nasca Kingdom, taking advantage of Rudra&rsquo;s expedition. It was the work of a warring enemy, and resulted in the deaths of both Lucia and Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At that moment, Rudra&rsquo;s dreams came crashing down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&lsquo;I&hellip;I just wanted Veldanava to feel reassured, to accept us&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rudra killed his heart, knowing that his lamentations could no longer be heard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All that was left as ideal that had lost its purpose.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;You still want to do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;Yes. All I have left is this game with you. Your approval is the only thing I have left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;All right then. I&rsquo;ll keep playing with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, the game continued&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next tragedy befell Milim, Veldanava&rsquo;s daughter.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Milim had grown up without knowing her own parents&rsquo; faces.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She didn&rsquo;t even know that she was related to Rudra.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Milim&rsquo;s only family member and protector, her pet, was killed in some state plot.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Milim lamented in grief and burst into a rage. It was decided that Guy would do everything in his power to appease Milim.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he hadn&rsquo;t stopped her, many nations would have perished.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;You still want to do this? If I had acted sooner, Milim wouldn&rsquo;t have been sad, would she?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault. But even so, if we stop now, all the sacrifices we&rsquo;ve made up until now will be for nothing. As Emperor, it is my responsibility to make to not give up now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, but whatever. I&rsquo;ll stay with you until you&rsquo;re satisfied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If he stopped here, Rudra would break.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So Guy had no choice but to delay the conclusion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An unhappy future was guaranteed. That&rsquo;s what he believed, but it was not yet certain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so, the game continued&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Repeated tragedies.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ugliness of the human world at hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With each reincarnation, his holy power slowly depleted and Rudra gradually lost his qualification as a Hero.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even so, Rudra remained a &ldquo;Saint&rdquo; because of his desire and dedication to his ideals.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But even so, there eventually came a limit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At some point unknown to him, Rudra&rsquo;s mind corroded and his original ideals were lost.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As was the habit of those who had lost sight of their purpose, he was willing to use any means necessary to defeat Guy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ruthless and cruel.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Defeating Guy was all that mattered, and in the end, more blood would be spilled.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was just how Guy had judged it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finally, the day had come.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Guy bet on the last possibility, all according to the rules of the game.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He entrusted the most unknown and hopeful of his pawns, Rimuru, to be the final judge.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In all honesty, he wanted to make the move himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But Guy obeyed the rules to the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a result&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the distance, the breath of his friend vanished.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not just Rimuru who could have done it&mdash;Guy couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no bitterness or regret.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was only mourning for the man who was his best friend.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I told you, asshole.
