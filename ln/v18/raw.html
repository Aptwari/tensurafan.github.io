Because of this, the main construction had been suspended. However, the rest of the work was still carrying on as usual with the remaining workers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Obera of the Three Phantom Commanders who came to such a place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the top floor of the Sky Castle, in the Sky Room known as a temporary office, Milim and Obera were confronting one another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only other person present was Midley, who was standing behind Milim. All the others had been evacuated from the area, as they would not be able to help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim herself had sent Karion and Frey away and was not participating in the war. There were several reasons for this, but ultimately, the most important one was the defense of her country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When considering things from the Empire&rsquo;s perspective, she could not deny the possibility that the Empire might invade through her territory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Furthermore, if she took the initiative to join the war, that would mean laying her hands on humans, which was not her intention. So Milim chose to stay behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that this was the right choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;What business do you have with me</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim asked, addressing the miscreant who had come to take advantage of the opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Midley quietly kept an eye on the proceedings, having absolute trust in Milim. He was simply waiting for Obera&#39;s response to Milim&#39;s question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then there was Obera.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She removed the mythical-grade armor protecting her body and knelt down in front of Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A picture containing linedrawing

Obera introduced herself once more and elaborated on what was currently happening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Milim heard that her aunt Velgrynd, the Scorch Dragon, had fallen into Feldway&#39;s hands, she wanted to run out to rescue Rimuru right away, but Obera warned her that it was too late to take any action at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;What are you saying!?

At this moment, she was under orders to defend the Palace of Monsters</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">, and her visit to Milim was a serious violation of orders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although she should have explained that, Obera only felt ashamed of herself for failing to live up to Milim&#39;s expectations. Seeing her penitent attitude, Milim had no choice but to quell her anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It seems I&#39;ve been pretty unreasonable.

For now, I think it would be best for us to act within Feldway&#39;s trust&hellip;what will you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Feldway gives her an order, Obera says that she will obey. However, if Milim wishes, she is prepared to defect from Feldway at this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her hair was as black as the night sky, and her eyes shone like the stars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. I can&#39;t sense any lies in your words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;By your will</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">. The whole truth, it is my heart&#39;s desire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I ask you, what is your purpose?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as Milim asked, Obera began to speak without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Feldway seems to be plotting the resurrection of Veldanava-sama, but I consider that act to be irreverent. Your divine father will be resurrected without any help. And the fact that he cannot be resurrected easily must be because of some reason. It is very, very difficult for one like me to discern God&#39;s will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, Obera believes that rather than trying to revive Veldanava, Milim, his daughter, should be crowned Lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re on my side?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Such arrogance is beneath my diminutive frame. I wish to be your tool. I have nothing to ask of you, and it gives me the greatest pleasure to be of service to you, so please command me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everything was as Milim wills it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was Obera&#39;s intention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim understood this but was puzzled by Obera&#39;s resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then you&#39;re willing to betray Feldway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that is just a difference of opinion. Rather, it is Feldway who is disobeying the will of Veldanava-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera affirmed as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The tone of her voice was proof that she was serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I believe that Veldanava-sama&#39;s will is for the happiness of you, his daughter. I am convinced of this, and therefore have no compassion for those who would do you harm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, this is a story before a betrayal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To Obera, who believed that Feldway&#39;s actions would be harmful to Milim, her colleague was nothing but an enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Obera was wise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Instead of acting on her own, she had the wisdom to leave everything to Milim. She took great care to ensure that her actions did not interfere with Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is why she risked her life to meet Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She would not do anything if Milim so wished, but if she was ordered to, she would bare her fangs at anyone no matter who they were. This was the true nature of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders&rdquo; Obera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim was not blind to this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well. Then I will trust you and make you one of my subordinates. Midley, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, Milim-sama. I don&rsquo;t think there will be any objections.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay! Then Obera, you are one of us starting from today. They are not here right now, but I&rsquo;ll introduce you to Karion and Frey once the war is over!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahahahaha! Now, with Midley as the leader, I also have the &lsquo;Four Heavenly Kings.&rsquo; I&#39;ll have to show off to Rimuru!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as Obera decided to join, Milim laughed heartily. She had decided to call her subordinates the &lsquo;Four Heavenly Kings&rsquo; in order to compete with Rimuru&#39;s Four Heavenly Kings, which she had been secretly jealous of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Frey had been there at the time, the idea would definitely have been rejected. But fortunately for Milim, Midley was the only one present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m the leader! Well, that&rsquo;s only natural. No one knows Milim-sama better than I do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Midley, whose number one priority was always Milim, there was no way that he could oppose her, especially if he were to be given the leadership of the Four Heavenly Kings. Rather, he was overjoyed and agreed immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, Milim&rsquo;s &lsquo;Four Heavenly Kings&rsquo; were established.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera, who was suddenly appointed as one of the Four Heavenly Kings, showed no sign of being upset and accepted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s words were the will of God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because of that, Obera gave priority to Milim in everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, a vexing problem arose here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, now then&hellip;What should we do with Obera? That is the question. It&rsquo;s at times like these that I wish I could consult Rimuru&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, that&#39;s a difficult question for sure. Should we have her stay here, or should we have her remain in the enemy camp and work as a spy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Either way, there are pros and cons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She really should think it over carefully, plus Milim wanted to hear from Karion and Frey as well. If possible, she also wanted to consult Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, Milim and Midley were the only ones here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What about you&mdash;what do you want to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Midley was not the intellectual type, so he was not the best person to consult with. Milim, who was well aware of this, asked Obera directly instead of relying on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera replied without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As for me, I would like to return to the Palace of Monsters. I haven&#39;t manifested my body here, so if I stay, I&#39;ll have to force myself to materialize my body. Moreover&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera&#39;s role was to deal with the cryptids in the other world. Strictly speaking, monitoring the movements of Ivarage, the World-destroying Dragon, was her primary mission.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cornu&#39;s primary mission was to invade other dimensions, and Zalario&#39;s was to deal with the insectars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the pact between Phantom King Feldway and &ldquo;Insect Lord&rdquo; Zelanus, Zalario was now able to move freely. However, it was still difficult to communicate with Ivarage, and Obera&#39;s body remained bound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Insect Lord Zelanus and the World-destroying Dragon Ivarage? They sound strong!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Zelanus is one thing, but Ivarage is very nasty. A world-destroying malevolence in itself, where coexistence is impossible. It is allowed to exist by Veldanava-sama&#39;s will, but must still be prevented from being released from the Otherworld.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If she stayed here, Ivarage&#39;s surveillance would be neglected. Obera wanted to make sure that Ivarage would not affect Feldway&#39;s plans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. Then you should keep on watching him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But then, I wonder&hellip;what does Feldway plan to do with Ivarage?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I am wondering the same thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were unaware of Feldway&#39;s plans, so their questions were only natural.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then Obera disclosed all the information she knew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Feldway was given the task to monitor Ivarage by Veldanava-sama. However, he intends to abandon that mission in favor of resurrecting Veldanava-sama. We are currently expanding the Underworld Gate, and as soon as it is complete, we plan to invade this Cardinal World with all the phantoms and insectars.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, the expansion of the &lsquo;Underworld Gate&rsquo; was a long-term plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But what are you going to do after that? Won&rsquo;t Ivarage be released as well if you can&#39;t close the opened gates?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is a possibility, and I told Feldway as much. But he didn&#39;t care about that at all. I cannot understand what he&#39;s thinking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Feldway is crazy. It is safe to assume that he is willing to let the world be destroyed as long as Veldanava-sama can be resurrected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway hated this world for taking Veldanava away from him. He intended to remake the world, leaving only those he had selected. If Ivarage destroyed the world, that may even be convenient for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In other words, we&#39;ll be the ones in trouble then, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What an annoying situation. Zelanus seems to be troublesome, he should just be sealed up in the other world&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim and Midley look at each other in disgust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They had promised to play with Rimuru and the others, but the war had forced them to postpone. On top of that, Milim&#39;s mood had taken a nosedive with this new problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll just have to send Feldway flying</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was an easy snap decision on Milim&#39;s part.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. Then Milim-sama, I, Midley, leader of the &lsquo;Four Heavenly Kings,&rsquo; would like to receive the orders to defeat Feldway!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Midley, who lives for Milim, agrees without thinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;m counting on you, Midley. I&rsquo;ll be heading into battle as one of the generals. We&#39;ll crush Feldway&#39;s ambitions with our own hands!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaa&mdash;yes!! I am looking forward to it so much that my arms are tingling! I&rsquo;ll show you what I can do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With Frey out of the picture, it seemed that no one could stop these two from running amok. But then, Obera spoke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please wait. I have been sharing information with Feldway and the others since the start of the mission, and it seems that Emperor Rudra captured Velgrynd-sama&#39;s Dragon Factor. However, at the last minute, Demon Lord Rimuru interfered, and the final plan was suspended.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was enough information to make Milim calm down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So Rimuru is safe?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. The mission is now over, and Feldway is pulling back to base.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;In that case, it&#39;s too soon to make our move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&mdash;hmm~, Midley&#39;s right&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With their momentum suddenly sapped, Midley and Milim regained their composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They had time to spare before Feldway began his next operation. It would be better to work with Rimuru and the others rather than to force something at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In any case, it was important share all of this information first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim did not fail to understand this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then Obera, you will keep an eye on Feldway&#39;s movements until I give you an order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;As you wish.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Keep in contact with &lsquo;Magic Communication.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim and Obera adjusted a special wavelength that would work only between the two of them. It would take a lot of magic to cross dimensions, but with their level of skill, it would be no problem. In this way, a means of communication was secured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After such a series of exchanges, the meeting came to an end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now then, I will take my leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After saying that, Obera departed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim and Midley, who were left behind, were troubled by the prospect of a new conflict.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c17"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c21">Chapter 1</span></h1><h2 class="c13"><span class="c21">Walpurgis</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The destination through Rain&#39;s &ldquo;portal&rdquo; was a silvery world of ice and snow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unlike last time, it seemed that the venue was to be Guy&#39;s palace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain guided me as I stepped inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Shion and Diablo followed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although the outside was too frigid for any living thing survive, the temperature inside of the castle was comfortable. However, half of the castle had collapsed and it was obvious that something had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, so you&rsquo;re here. I&#39;m sure Milim and Dagruel will be here soon, so make yourself comfortable and wait for them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy told me as he led me to the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were several round tea tables in a large hall that looked as if it could be used for a ball. Chairs were also placed irregularly, so that we could sit freely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Looking at the guests, I saw that Ruminas and Leon had already arrived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behind Ruminas was Pope Louis and the old butler Gunther.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behind Leon were the two knights, Alrose and Claude, both fully armed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was a little relieved to see familiar faces. After a brief exchange of greetings, I took a seat. Shion and Diablo seemed to refrain from sitting down and waited behind me instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wish they would sit down too, but I&rsquo;ll let them do as they please.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">And then, Ramiris made her loud appearance.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, what&#39;s the deal with you leaving me behind!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ah!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought we had gone together, but it seems that Ramiris was left behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wha-what? Ramiris-sama, why weren&#39;t you with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was caught off guard. Rain, who had been guiding us, was flustered as well. She seemed to have assumed that Ramiris was following her and was surprised to see her getting angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rain, it is unlike you to make a mistake. I received an urgent request from Ramiris-sama to pick her up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Mizari who said this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just like Rain, Mizari&#39;s face was battered and bruised, though her expression remained sharp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had initially thought that those two were similar, but&hellip;Perhaps it was because I didn&#39;t have the luxury of time until now, but the differences in their personalities stood out clearly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rain-chan, you seem to be distracted because of your injury! I was just worrying about who I should take with me, you know! But even so!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I noticed that Ramiris had two attendants with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beretta and&hellip;&hellip;&mdash;Hey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Veldora, what are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas reacted to my words and turned to look behind Ramiris.

It&rsquo;s also partly because I don&#39;t want to be disliked and partly a calculation so as not to antagonize them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the other hand, when I get close to someone, I naturally call them by his/her name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are a few people like Haruna-san or Treyni-san, who for some reason make me want to use the &ldquo;-san&rdquo; honorific, but those people are exceptions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Putting those thoughts aside&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this time, more voices from some unexpected people were heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">[Ruminas&rsquo; voice] &ldquo;Rimuru, you&rsquo;ve been calling me by my name too, so it&#39;s probably a little late for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right.

There were snacks on the table, so we spent some time reaching for them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a while&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s going on, Guy?

Frey says that&#39;s good manners.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim arrived, looking full of energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was still as noisy as ever, which was very typical of Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so, Frey?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yes. Guy-sama.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Frey, as I was saying to Rimuru, no honorifics, please. The same with Karion and you guys there. Any of you in this room deserve it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, Guy just said something I didn&#39;t expect&hellip;I am convinced too. Everyone in this room is strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If I had to choose, I&#39;d say that Leon&#39;s followers were inferior in terms of magicule quantity, but their skills still seemed to be quite good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On top of that, Frey-san had awakened into a &ldquo;True Demon Lord&rdquo; and had reached the Million-class. It was unknown how strong she had become, but she was not someone to be mocked as a mere subordinate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As if she was aware of this, Frey-san nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, thank you. I&#39;ll freely call you as such, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san responded, looking around Guy&#39;s castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion followed suit, addressing Guy in a dignified manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve never been good with honorifics, so it&#39;s nice of you to say so. So, Guy, what kind of business did you call us in for today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Like Frey-san, Karion was also in the millions-class. He had always had the aura of a king from the start, so his irreverent attitude felt forgivable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When our eyes met, he greeted me with one hand raised in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy responded to Karion with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, wait just a minute. Dagruel will be here soon, so we can talk then. But still, I&rsquo;m surprised. Not only Karion, but Frey has awakened as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, one would notice. I had heard it from the reports, but after seeing him in person, I can tell that he&rsquo;s become far stronger than before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks to you. Perhaps it&rsquo;s exactly as Milim calculated, but this war has helped me overcome my limitations as a harpy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Frey-san smiled, and Guy nodded in satisfaction saying, &ldquo;That&#39;s what it means to climb to the top.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Well, I guess I&#39;m the same way. </span><span class="c11 c22">I was able to get rid of the shame of the beastmen</span><span class="c0">, and I guess it&#39;s not all bad to play along with Milim&#39;s schemes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion laughed out loud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whaaat!?

You must have thought that if we remained weak, we&rsquo;d die in future battles, right? That&#39;s why you gave us the chance to fight the humans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. If this is the world Rimuru-dono wants, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get the souls needed to awaken. Perhaps this was your last chance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t right.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&mdash;Ahh! I don&#39;t know. Stop talking nonsense and just sit down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim&#39;s attitude as she shouted was, by all appearances, one of embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;So that&#39;s what she was trying to do,&rsquo; I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But that&#39;s beside the point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, Frey-san. You don&#39;t have to address me by &#39;-dono&#39; or any other honorific title.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was trying to make a point, but Frey-san snickered at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rejected. You are a friend of Milim-chan, our master, so you should be respected as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, no, but you call Milim so informally too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t find that very convincing&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Also, you&rsquo;ve been referring to me with &ldquo;-san&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;as well. Can you stop that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I got caught in my own line of questioning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san&#39;s request was a difficult hurdle for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion is one thing, but I don&#39;t feel comfortable calling out to Frey-san so casually.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How do I put it, is it the aura that I&rsquo;m not good with?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Whenever I am in front of a beautiful woman, I feel debilitated</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim is a child, and Ruminas is a beautiful young girl, so it&#39;s safe. If they had been more mature, I might have had a little trouble reacting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the person was as disappointing as Shion though, the hurdle would be instantly lowered and I would be fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahahaha! Rimuru, so you&#39;re not good with adult beauties, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He saw through me!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.

If I know that it&rsquo;s you, I won&rsquo;t be happy about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was so annoyed that I lost all my tension.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I completely ignored Guy&#39;s words and spilled out my true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufu, of course! After all, Rimuru-sama has a beautiful secretary like me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wait, you&#39;re going to say that about yourself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kufufufu.

Could it be that this meeting is really serious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was the first thing Dagruel said as he sat down on the large chair that Rain guided him to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was interesting because the chair looked distorted even though it was made of massive stone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In any case, no one had mentioned it, but I still noticed it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, everyone had definitely noticed it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was also a big crack running through walls of this hall. Just by looking at it, it was obvious that something had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because I knew that it would be very troublesome, I had been diverting the topic to avoid facing the reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was an escape to avoid getting involved in the situation, but now that everyone was here, there seemed to be no choice but to get down to business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, things have gotten a little complicated. For once, I seriously want to borrow everyone&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hoh, that&#39;s a pretty big deal, coming from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy nodded, and Dagruel turned serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He must have read the situation and decided that things seemed seriously troublesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t just wisdom he wanted to borrow, I thought, with a faraway look in my eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wasn&rsquo;t the only one, but Guy stood up and announced with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now then, let&#39;s change venues. Let us have an important discussion with our highly cooperative &ldquo;Octagram,&rdquo; first!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cooperative?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t sleep-talk&rsquo; I almost muttered to myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That smile gave me a bad feeling, but&hellip;sadly, there seemed to be no way to refuse, so we all reluctantly followed Guy&#39;s lead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The venue was a hall with a round table that seemed to be isolated from the outside world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that drinks had already been prepared for us was quite impressive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy sat at the top, and I sat opposite of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From my point of view, Milim was on Guy&#39;s right and Ramiris was on his left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To my right was Leon. Between Milim and Leon was Ruminas, and on the other side was Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ramiris&#39; chair was small, but the seat was higher than the top of the round table. And since Dagruel&#39;s chair was several times heavier than usual, the arrangement was well balanced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as I sat down, it was obvious that there was an empty seat between me and Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By the way, I don&rsquo;t see Dino, do we have to wait for him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel asked the obvious question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The other demon lords seemed to be curious as well, and their eyes focused on Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahh, that&#39;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy looked at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I immediately had the feeling that he was aiming towards me</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru-kun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy seemed to know about Dino&#39;s betrayal after all. I didn&rsquo;t know what kind of an information network he had, but the fact that he was talking to me suggested that he had a grasp of the situation to some extent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, yes. You want me to explain, right? Dino was a traitor. That is all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Too brief! Be more polite and detailed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Damn, it can&rsquo;t be helped&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was useless to resist any further, so I gave up and decided to explain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I told them that Dino, who was staying in our country, betrayed us and turned to the enemy&rsquo;s side. However, I did not hide the fact that it was probably due to the influence of Michael&#39;s &ldquo;Ultimate Dominion,&rdquo; regardless of his intentions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dino changed sides&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel muttered to himself as he finished listening to my story. Dagruel, who was a good friend of his, must have had some thoughts on the matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even though he&rsquo;s changed sides, it seems like he&#39;s still in control. I haven&#39;t confirmed his intentions, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Michael, was it? Are you trying to tell me that a mere Skill has a will of its own?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, so Guy didn&#39;t know why Dino betrayed him either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. At this point, he&#39;s developed an ego, and has taken over Rudra&#39;s body, acting as Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because I also have a partner, Ciel-san, we have the best evidence of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Wait, Rimuru! Did you say that the Ultimate Dominion</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;affects the skills of the angelic system? Then the question is, how do you tell the difference between angelic and demonic when the concepts are so vague?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, Ruminas made a good point!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what I was wondering as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just as I was thinking that, Guy stood up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll explain it to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then Guy started talking about Skills in surprising detail. It seemed like a huge secret, a secret about the way the world worked, but he was generous enough to share it with us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">According to him,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The laws of this world were established by Veldanava, but it seems that anyone with the right administrative power can influence those laws.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if you don&#39;t have that power, you can still rewrite the laws to some extent by intervening with your wish in magicules. In other words, this was the concept of magic, a kind of power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A Skill is something that has been systematized to a certain extent so that it can influence these laws.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Skills that reside in the soul of the strong-willed and are activated by their pure energy&mdash;that is the Ultimate Skill of the angelic system created by Veldanava, and among them are the seven powers called the Virtues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When I fought Veldanava, he had many powers, but after the world was stabilized, he left only the strongest one, the &lsquo;Justice King,&rsquo; and gave some of them away, releasing all that remained into the world. As a result, those powers were taken into the circle of reincarnation and appeared in the world in the form of qualified and strong souls. However, the Ultimate Skills were too strong, and were restricted to the unique level. They can be scattered among various Skills, or become a &lsquo;Virtue&rsquo; type Unique Skill while retaining a certain amount of authority.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I felt like the Virtue skill system was in contrast to the Deadly Sins skill system. In other words, there was the virtuous system and sinful system, or the angelic system and the demonic system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But, well, from the way Guy was talking now, it seemed like there were not seven Ultimate Skills in the Virtue system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The &#39;Wisdom King (Raphael)&#39; I got was also an evolution from &#39;Great Sage&#39;, and it seemed to have nothing to do with &#39;Virtue&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m a simple guy, so I was convinced by Guy&#39;s explanation, but Ruminas asked a question again, as if there was nothing to hide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Guy, if you know something, tell me. Are there seven angelic system skills in total? And what are their powers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that you mention it, I was curious about that too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, the other demon lords seem to be feeling the same way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, you&#39;re all united like never before. All right then, I&#39;ll tell you. First, the seven virtues of the angelic system&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy was very knowledgeable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The seven virtuous powers that Veldanava was said to have possessed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">According to Guy&#39;s description&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill &#39;Justice King (Michael)&#39; &mdash; Its command is Mental Control itself, the strongest power specialized in the chain of command with a real &#39;Absolute Defense&#39; like the &#39;Castle Guard.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Ultimate Skill Knowledge</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;King (Raphael)&#39; &mdash; The power to manage the laws of the world, specializing in support.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39; &mdash; A power that specializes in spatial management and is used for the management of all events.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill &#39;Hope King (Sariel)&#39; &mdash; The source of life, and the power to manage the circle of reincarnation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill &#39;Purity King (Metatron)&#39; &mdash; The power to sort out all mixed laws, prevent interference, and select pure energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill &#39; Charity King (Raguel)&#39; &mdash; The power to provide support and amplification to others. It has been given to Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimate Skill &#39;Patience King (Gabriel)&#39; &mdash; The power to fix the status and respond to unforeseen circumstances.

Veldanava gave his &#39;Justice King (Michael)&#39; to Rudra, so he got his &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39; back in return. That is the one that Rudra acquired and made ultimate. There probably would have been some changes in performance. Well, that&#39;s lost now, so we can&#39;t be sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No one interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, Guy continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I knew that &#39;Justice King&#39; (Michael) who went to Rudra had the power to dominate others, but it was more powerful than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was there that Guy faltered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While I waited for Guy to say something, our eyes met.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know Rimuru, don&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, there was no reason to lie here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If I could, I&#39;d have liked to pretend that I didn&rsquo;t know anything, but I can&#39;t do that. Because I didn&#39;t talk about the Ultimate Dominion properly in my explanation earlier, I&rsquo;d give my take on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that the problem had grown so large, I thought that covering it up would only make things worse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah. I know him, or rather, I fought him just the other day. When Veldora was influenced by the enemy, I thought it was all over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Velgrynd had been influenced too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I had such a hard time because you pushed me into trouble! You didn&#39;t just get me into a fight with Rudra, you got me into a full-scale war!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll argue the point that must be made.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But well, to Guy that was nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahahaha! It&#39;s fine because you won.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&#39;s not! Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth was destroyed by Velgrynd, and the area around our town was turned into a hellish scorched earth. Well, the restoration is going well, but I will never accept requests from you again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I got swept up in the momentum and yelled out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With this, I hope he will not ask of me any unreasonable requests for the time being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, you&#39;ve been doing that sort of thing with magic for a while now. Oh well. So, what&#39;s your conclusion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was slurring my words earlier when I said &lsquo;&#39;influenced,&rsquo; but I&#39;ll rephrase it correctly. Michael&#39;s &ldquo;Ultimate Dominion&rdquo; is a heinous power of absolute control over the holders of the Angelic Ultimate Skills.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s ridiculous&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to believe. A person who reaches the ultimate skill must have a strong mind. Human or demon, it&#39;s the same. To be completely dominated&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Accept it. The proof is that not only Veldora, but also Velgrynd were placed under Michael&#39;s control. I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if I hadn&#39;t seen it with my own eyes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or rather, I still didn&rsquo;t want to believe it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was like a nightmare, something I never want to experience again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru&rsquo;s story is true. As proof, Velgrynd has &#39;Charity King (Raguel)&#39; and Velzard, as I said, has the Ultimate Skill &#39;Patience King (Gabriel)&#39;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I suspected as much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Judging from the collapse of this castle, there must have been a fight with a hell of an opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want to admit it, but it seems that Velzard had been taken over by Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My bad prediction had come true, and I felt depressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Guy! In other words, are you saying that Velzard-dono has turned against us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right, Dagruel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way! That&rsquo;s a big deal!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy&#39;s affirmation upset Dagruel. Since they&#39;ve known each other for a long time, I guess he knows how dangerous Velzard is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the other hand, I don&#39;t know her that well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sure she&#39;s dangerous, but I&#39;m not sure how dangerous she is. I couldn&rsquo;t set a threat level because I couldn&#39;t really feel it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Just asking, but could you possibly have defeated and locked her away somewhere&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru, do you really think that such a convenient story exists?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So there wasn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was annoyed that Guy was so appalled and that my wishful thinking was shut down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;This sucks.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Michael&#39;s team now includes Velzard-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t help but mutter to myself something that echoed the mood of everyone else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;&hellip;Good grief.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon seemed distressed as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suspected as much, but this is unfortunate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas also had a dark expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think that was only natural. But I don&#39;t think he&rsquo;ll be able to beat us because he had let Guy escape without a fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry! There are still seven of the eight stars left here. Besides, the others are strong enough too! Let&#39;s go on a rampage and show them what we can do!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why does Milim look so happy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I thought, there was definitely something wrong with the True Dragon&#39;s blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, everyone all knew that the situation was the worst, but there was still some more unpleasant information to add.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now, to continue answering your question as to whether there are a total of seven angelic skills, the answer is no.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;This is the worst.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas looked displeased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, do you know how many of the Angelic Ultimate Skills there are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Dagruel asked, Guy answered gravely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know all of them either. When I fought Veldanava, I couldn&#39;t even see the bottom of it. He told me about the Seven Virtues. He also said he was going to give each of the Seven Primordial Angels a special power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silence enveloped the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition to the seven virtues, one for each of the seven angels, that would make a total of fourteen&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You make it sound like he didn&#39;t give one to all of them&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right, Dagruel. The angels back then had weak egos, and some of them couldn&#39;t handle an Ultimate Skill. That&#39;s why Veldanava gave Velzard and Velgrynd &#39;Patience King (Gabriel)&#39; and &#39;Charity King (Raguel)&#39;. It seems that he also granted skills to the eligible angels, but released the rest of the skills he didn&#39;t transfer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He left himself the &#39;Justice King (Michael)&#39;, which he traded for the &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39; that Rudra later acquired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then, when Veldanava died, the &#39;Covenant King (Uriel)&#39; was also lost. It circled around and eventually became my power, and was now merged with Velgrynd&#39;s Divine Flame King (Cthugha).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is not the time to be escaping from reality by mulling over the history. I feel that I have to keep it a secret for sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In any case, now I can see the whole picture to some extent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In other words, the angelic skills are pure skills created by Veldanava, and it is possible that there were at least 14 of them. And whoever manifests and acquires them will not be able to resist Michael&#39;s Ultimate Dominion, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I summed it up, and Guy nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Which brought me to my next question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait. The angelic skills are okay, but what about the demonic skills?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, Ramiris asked exactly what I wanted to ask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All eyes focused on Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s a tough one to answer, but listen. I gained the Unique Skill &#39;Pride&#39; when I was defeated by Veldanava. I had been observing him, trying to emulate his strength, and I think that&#39;s the secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ramiris, your skills were born with you so you may not realize it, but acquiring Skill is influenced by one&#39;s wishes. It still depends on the individual, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After answering that, Guy gave a brief explanation on Skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A Skill is normally found in the material body, the spiritual body, or the astral body. However, there are some special cases where the skill will reside in the soul itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Naturally, because the soul is so close to the essence of the person, the desire is greater, and it makes sense that the thing inhabiting the soul would become a powerful skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition to this, consider it in combination with Ciel-san&#39;s view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is true that there was something in a Unique Skill that resided in a material body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The Unique Skill &#39;Berserker&#39;, for example, is easy to understand because it was inherited by Larzen</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;who took Shogo&#39;s body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are various examples like that, but I agree with the opinion that the power rooted in the soul is more powerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s easy to hide, so it&#39;s hard to be stolen, and it can also be a trump card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, the Ultimate Skill is probably a soul-level power, and I think that&#39;s why the number of people who can handle one is limited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But that&#39;s not all. There are two ways to take root in the soul, not just &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; but also &ldquo;being engraved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ciel-san, for example, is completely assimilated to my soul. It is impossible to separate the two, so I don&#39;t have to worry about it being stolen. Still, I think it&#39;s safer to keep it a secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is also the case with an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it is only dwelling in the soul, it might be stolen, but if it is engraved, there is no need to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, that would be impossible to detect&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While thinking like this, I listened to everyone&#39;s conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Which brings me to my earlier point&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You said that the power Veldanava unleashed was taken into the circle of reincarnation and came to reside in a strong soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, that&#39;s right, but in my case I didn&#39;t receive any of Veldanava&#39;s power. I wasn&#39;t given any special powers by Veldanava like Ramiris. It&#39;s a power I created myself. You get it? By imitating pure power, a Skill was born. And that is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The demonic system,&rsquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. So then my &lsquo;Lustful King (Asmodeus)&rsquo; is just an imitation, a degraded version, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the case. If a Skill is the result of your own will and desire, it has the same power as the original. I didn&#39;t want to tell you this, but my &lsquo;Pride&rsquo; has evolved into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Pride King (Lucifer)&rsquo;. That power is comparable to the angelic system, and the strength of will is what decides victory or defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Guy, it&rsquo;s just like you to say that&hellip;Well, okay. Just to confirm, according to you, there are at least fourteen demonic system Ultimate Skills, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Probably.

The &#39;Purity King (Metatron)&#39; that we&#39;ve been talking about is my Skill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sure everyone was thinking that this was a big problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just when I thought the meeting would be coming to a close, a huge problem arose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, what should we do?&mdash;Hey, Rimuru-kun!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t dump this on me!

Rimuru can be very helpful in times like these!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right! Just leave this to Rimuru, and we&rsquo;ll have a cup of tea or something!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Selfish colleagues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Ramiris, you&#39;re especially terrible. I&rsquo;ll be sure to remember this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is why demon lords are so scary. What kind of cooperation is this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the midst of all this, Dagruel spoke up in exasperation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru, you&#39;ve had it pretty rough. I&#39;ve felt closer to you ever since I heard that you were forced to take care of Dino, and I feel sorry for you this time too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was such a good guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s a giant and a demon lord, but appearances can be deceiving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dagruel-san, thank you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The &ldquo;-san&rdquo; is unnecessary. I&#39;m sure we&rsquo;ve brought this up before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I should be aware of the fact that I&rsquo;m a demon lord by now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think being too humble can be harmful in certain situations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then once again, thank you Dagruel!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm, don&#39;t worry about it. Anyway, is Leon alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel nodded lightly, and the conversation returned to the topic at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas also joined in, as if they were on the same page.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. He looks the same as usual, but it&rsquo;s important to know whether or not Leon is under control, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone&#39;s eyes focused on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s best to ask the person himself about such things, but he doesn&#39;t seem to be aware of it. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll just have to guess, but before I do, there was something I wanted to confirm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As I said before, when Dino betrayed us, the labyrinth was destroyed and the enemy was able to invade. We believe that he came into contact with Phantom King Feldway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Once they were inside the labyrinth, complete isolation from the outside was impossible. That&#39;s why, although they didn&#39;t seem to be able to talk directly, they might have been able to communicate through &lsquo;telekinesis&rsquo; or something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ramiris added to my explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the time being, it seems that she was willing to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While considering Ramiris&rsquo; nice assist, I asked Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;d like to ask&mdash;what happened here? I know that Velzard-san became an enemy and went on a rampage, but I want to know how it happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you know about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I think anyone who saw this mess would recognize it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was obvious to me that Guy and Velzard had fought. Otherwise, there wouldn&#39;t be such a mess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What I&#39;m curious about is how it happened, or rather, how Velzard fell into the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Is it possible to send a command to the &ldquo;control circuit&rdquo; from anywhere, or is it necessary to get closer to a certain extent?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Depending on the answer, the threat level will be different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Also, Velzard and probably Dino were given their powers by Veldanava, while Leon acquired it on his own and brought it to the ultimate level. While his &ldquo;control circuit&rdquo; might not have disappeared, there is still the possibility that there is a glitch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If so, that would explain why Leon&#39;s commands might not be going through. In any case, it&#39;s important to get accurate information first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re right, that bastard Feldway broke through the Ice and Snow &#39;Barriers&#39;. It was Mizari and Rain who greeted him, and I thought I&#39;d go out and give him a thrashing. But then Velzard got in the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmmm&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In other words, he didn&#39;t make direct contact, but he came close. It&rsquo;s the same conditions as Dino, but I&#39;m not sure what to make of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you&#39;re saying they need to get within a certain distance to interfere with the control circuit? You don&rsquo;t think that this might be a trick to make us think that, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leon, do you feel anything about yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t feel anything. I&#39;m just me, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being controlled by anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon replied confidently, but even Lieutenant Kondou and Velgrynd had not been aware that they were being controlled. It was impossible to trust that statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In other words, your beloved is me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Idiot, of course it&#39;s Chloe.

Oh, so there it is. After all, even Veldanava-sama wishes for my victory!!&rsquo;&mdash;That&#39;s what he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From what he said, we can infer that even Feldway and Michael do not know who possesses the Angelic Ultimate Skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is no guarantee that this was not an act, but there is no point in doubting it. Because my intuition is telling me that it is safe, I should proceed towards believing in Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;Using &lsquo;Predation&rsquo; on Leon and destroying the &ldquo;control circuit&rdquo; itself is a sure way&mdash;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ciel-san interrupted me quite casually, but I refused to accept it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of predating Leon, physiologically speaking. Maybe that&#39;s why I wanted to believe in Leon even more than I did before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, we&#39;re not going to come to any conclusions by talking about it here, and although I&rsquo;m skeptical, I personally think it&#39;s fine. So, let&#39;s just judge Leon as &ldquo;gray close to black&rdquo; and see what happens!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I declared as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it okay, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At Guy&rsquo;s questions, I nod my head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m not completely sure yet, but I don&#39;t think the enemy has grasped the locations of the angelic skill users.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is the basis for saying so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel asked curiously, so I presented my own thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In Ramiris&#39; labyrinth, there are records of the battles with Feldway and his men. From what they said, I&#39;m guessing that the only Skills they know of are those that were given directly by Veldanava. If the Skill is self-acquired, they probably won&#39;t know about it unless they get close.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right! It&#39;s annoying that someone can so easily read information from my labyrinth, but it&#39;s being put to good use, so I&rsquo;m not complaining!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">To put Ramiris in a good mood, I nodded and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a great help</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c0">, seriously.&rdquo; It was true that the labyrinth was superior in every way, so I thanked her without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Feel free to praise me more!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">And so, Ramiris was very pleased</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I brushed off the comment and returned to the topic at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s not like Leon&#39;s been spreading the word about his skill, so I think it will take a while for people to know about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It would be a foolish thing to do, to expose one&#39;s hand, except under such circumstances.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon muttered to me in resignation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, Guy seemed to be convinced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Certainly, Leon is right. Well, there is a good chance they&#39;ll see through us if they get too close, and I agree that we can&#39;t be absolutely sure, but it would be foolish to be overly cautious and split up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I have no objection to that either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas summed it up, and Dagruel agreed. The two of them seem to be on the same page, despite their differences.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was interesting to see them scowling at each other in a not-so-amused manner, but they seemed to have no issues, since they hadn&#39;t lost their cool while fighting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I trust Rimuru&#39;s word, and Leon&#39;s word is not a lie!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim gave her seal of approval, and just when I thought the matter was settled, Ramiris muttered something unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right.

Rudra has the Skill &#39;Army of Angels, Armageddon&#39;, which allows him to summon an army of angels and control them at will. Although, it seems that Rudra has difficulty controlling it and has only issued simple commands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy explained to everyone that its activation cycle was about every 500 years. However, because the summoned angel would have no body, it could only last a week at most before disappearing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a new thing to consider, but I wish he had told us this earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have a question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do angels, like demons, take root in the world when they incarnate?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oops, I didn&#39;t even have to ask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s wife Momiji&#39;s race, the tengu, was born from the incarnation of an angel into a wolf.

So he prioritized the individual instead of the number. In that case, he&#39;s at least as powerful as Clayman.

The superior angels are the seraphim, but surely someone as powerful as Clayman could withstand their power.

Recently, he&rsquo;s been reading a long historical work, saying that it might give him some great wisdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I&#39;m sure he&rsquo;ll come up with some kind of &ldquo;trap of justice</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;, and it&#39;s going to be my job to figure it out, so I don&#39;t feel like getting my hopes up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, I&#39;ll just consider it a blessing not to be disturbed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The situation is not that simple. In addition to Velzard-dono, isn&rsquo;t Velgrynd-dono in the hands of the enemy, as well? Even if we have the Veldora, the enemy will still have the advantage! In the first place, I don&#39;t like relying on that useless dragon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right. Veldora doesn&#39;t seem to be very reliable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s too timid in front of his sisters, and he was also recently captured by the enemy&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, Velgrynd-san is fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was letting my mind wander, so I answered absent-mindedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Needless to say, that was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How can you be so sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the time I realized it, it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was planning to be more discrete with my information, but now that I&#39;m here, I have no choice but to be honest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Due to various events in her fight against me, Velgrynd-san has broken free from the Ultimate Dominion.

Of the Seven Primordial Angels, there are four that have crossed over to the other world, including Feldway, but three of them attacked Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right! Of course, I was able to drive them away with my own strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ramiris nodded her head, as if my comment had reminded her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I quickly continued my explanation so as not to interrupt the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, regardless of the truth of it. They called themselves Phantom King Feldway and his &#39;Three Phantom Commanders&#39;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Yeah. They&#39;ve been trying to destroy the humans of our world for since ancient times. We call them demons</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class="c0">, but they&#39;re actually phantoms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I thought that all enemies of mankind were called demons, but I guess that wasn&rsquo;t the case. That said, one of the Three Phantom Commanders was destroyed by Velgrynd-san, so keep that in mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think it was Cornu, but it seems that he touched Velgrynd&rsquo;s reverse scale when he taunted Masayuki. I sensed that Velgrynd had gotten stronger, but even I was surprised that she was able to strike a blow against someone as strong as the Three Phantom Commanders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, that Cornu seemed to be less dominant than Zalario, let alone Feldway. That was my impression from the way Cornu behaved in the video recording. At the least, as a result of analyzing the information left in the labyrinth, Ciel-san judged that Cornu was inferior to me in terms of strength, even though we were almost even in terms of existence value.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rationale behind this is unknown, but I trust them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, we should never underestimate our opponents, but there is no need to be wary of those who have perished. That&#39;s what I was reporting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyway, Cornu is probably dead. I&#39;ve known him for a long time, but I don&#39;t feel anything for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy laughed in an unconcerned tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s just nice to have fewer enemies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was very much like Guy, so I tried to move on to the next report without any particular surprises.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then, Milim intervened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the right time, so I have something to report!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what she said, so I decided to listen to Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Actually, Obera, of the Three Phantom Commanders, has offered to join me. The meeting was held in secret, so Feldway and the others should not have noticed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not that I let my guard down, but I was unable to react to the report.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was like, &ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As expected of you, Milim. How&#39;d you get her to do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, let&#39;s hear it. Obera wasn&#39;t as narrow-minded as Cornu and she was a very serious woman. I don&#39;t think she had anything to do with the betrayal, so how did it come about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy and I asked Milim in perfect synchronicity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our eyes met, and that was enough for us to understand each other&#39;s thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, we were worried that Milim was being deceived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We nodded at each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s my natural charm. She came to me because she understood how great I was!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;It&#39;s hard being popular&rsquo;&mdash;Milim laughed, but I didn&rsquo;t take it for granted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Calm down. It could be the enemy&#39;s plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy rebukes, but Milim doesn&#39;t listen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s all right. Obera wasn&#39;t lying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Well&hellip;But you know, Milim, there is a very simple strategy called &ldquo;poison burial</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;, which is introduced in the scriptures (manga) of the Three Kingdoms, and sending spies to the enemy camp has been a common practice since ancient times. Contacting us at this time, when we are about to start a war, is like asking us to be suspicious, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Right now, Veldora is reading about this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Now I&#39;ll be familiar with strategy,&rsquo;&mdash;is what he said, but if it were that easy to train a military strategist, I wouldn&#39;t be having such a hard time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, his worldview is too different, so I think he&rsquo;s only useful as a reference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, it was suspicious, so I tried to persuade Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Milim only smiled fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s okay. I had my suspicions too, so I discussed it with Karion and Frey. And we all agreed that we should trust Obera.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmm, well, Milim is not a fool, so she probably did what she had to do. If Karion and Frey-san share the same opinion, then maybe we should trust them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What kind of discussion did you have with Obera?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;I asked for the time being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After hearing Milim&#39;s story, we would make our own decision as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, so Obera is monitoring the movements of Ivarage, the World-destroying Dragon, in the Palace of Monsters. In that case, she can&#39;t afford to do anything either way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was Guy&#39;s conclusion after hearing Milim&#39;s story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivarage and the cryptid subordinates are a non-negotiable army of destruction. If Obera made a move, Ivarage might be resurrected, so they would normally be excluded from the invasion force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, there was something that bothered me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If Feldway is willing to let the world die as Obera says, wouldn&#39;t he be willing to unleash Ivarage on us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway and Michael are hoping that Veldanava will be resurrected, but it will be terrible if that doesn&#39;t happen. Hope will be lost and a desire for destruction will arise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">There is nothing more frightening than a man who does not care about the future.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what I was thinking, but&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s the point, Rimuru. I can&#39;t believe that idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought it was a perfectly legitimate opinion, but surprisingly, it was very unpopular. Starting with Ruminas&#39; remarks, Dagruel also criticized me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That Feldway isn&rsquo;t stupid enough to use a monster that&#39;s stronger and more uncontrollable than he is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oho, so Ivarage is stronger?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was dreadful back then. Guy took care it, but I also helped to keep the planet from falling apart!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gahaha! Ivarage&#39;s destructive power can shatter the stars if he&#39;s not careful. If we fight him carelessly, we&#39;ll be in big trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you can only destroy the enemy, then what would you to do after that? If this planet is destroyed, it will no longer be a matter of world domination.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see&hellip;I guess my assumption was too naive. From what I&#39;ve heard about Ivarage, he seems to be a ridiculous monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahahaha! There&#39;s no shortage of opponents. If he comes out, I&#39;ll take care of him this time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rejected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rejected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s a rejection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milim, I know you&#39;re strong, but you&#39;re not careful enough. I&rsquo;m probably not the one who should be saying this, but you need to be more considerate of the damage you do to those around you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uhh, I&#39;ve already learned how to do that. That&#39;s why Ivarage&mdash;but with a twist&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand. Seriously though, if Ivarage does come back, I&#39;ll be the one to deal with him. I&#39;ve been wanting to get rid of that bastard. Next time I get the chance, I&#39;ll definitely get rid of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy proclaimed as such in a voice so cold it was frightening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Naturally, no one could argue with that. Milim was not happy, but she agreed to let Guy deal with Ivarage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, the conversation returned to Obera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can&#39;t you ask her about the enemy&#39;s situation or something?&rdquo; Dagruel asked Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I asked her, but she doesn&#39;t seem to know about the forces gained in our world. Feldway is suspicious, so she may have been wary of asking the wrong questions that might lead to false assumptions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Obera is right. Feldway is a sharp man, and he doesn&#39;t like his subordinates to think too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, they&rsquo;re just supposed to do what they&rsquo;re told?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I asked while thinking about my old troublesome boss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy answers me as I think nostalgically about the old days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not exactly. If you&#39;re doing your best on a given mission, you don&#39;t have time to worry about others. That&#39;s just the way he thinks, and that&#39;s why Obera&#39;s response is correct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If she was trying to fool us, it would have been better to use false information to gain trust. Instead, she said she didn&#39;t know, which seemed to increase Obera&#39;s credibility even more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, I don&#39;t think Feldway and I are going to get along.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To be so self-righteous that he can&#39;t think of his subordinates as anything but pawns. He seems to believe that everything he does is right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And, I can&rsquo;t help but spill my true intentions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy, who heard this, smiled at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that a sarcastic remark meant for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Yikes, how dangerous. Right here is a guy who&#39;s beyond just being self-righteous, he&#39;s dictatorial. In Guy&#39;s case, he doesn&#39;t even seem to consider the demons under his command as pawns. A careless remark like mine could very well bring out his fangs</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll just cover it up and continue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For the time being, I&#39;m more inclined to trust her, so I guess we&rsquo;ll wait and see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I said that, everyone nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that the Obera matter was settled, I returned to the main topic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There have been too many detours, how difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Ugh</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c0">, this meeting is not moving forward at all. No one&#39;s hiding any more secrets, are they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t help but complain, at which point everyone all rushed in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;You have no right to say that!&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s fair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m the one who seems to have the most secrets, so that statement was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While reflecting on that, I turned my attention to the meeting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For now, Ruminas was in charge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyway. We don&#39;t know each other well, so we can&#39;t cooperate. So, I will summarize the situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She begins by listing the enemy forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leading the enemy forces, is Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Under his control is the Frost Dragon, Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then there&rsquo;s Phantom King Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Under his command, is Zalario of the Three Phantom Commanders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then the insectar that Zalario was monitoring, and also their ruler, Insect Lord Zelanus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zelanus might have his own subordinates, but since Obera doesn&#39;t know much about them, it remains unclear. To be honest, this is the force that I was most worried about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, all of the insectar majins I know are extremely powerful. Zegion and Apito aside, there was also Razul, the guardian god of the West, and Minaza, the sixth-ranked &ldquo;Single Digit&rdquo; that Shion had defeated. Zelanus himself seemed to be dangerous, but he also seemed to have strong subordinates, so we had to be careful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then there&rsquo;s the Dino, Pico, and Gracia trio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that he (Dino) is an awakened demon lord is troubling enough, but we don&#39;t even know if he has an Ultimate Skill. It would not be surprising if he possessed one, so it would be better to estimate his strength on the assumption that he does.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And finally&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;An undead elf with an angel incarnating its body that could rival us. Hmm, that&#39;s tricky. I&#39;d feel a little better if I at least knew how many of them there were.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s extravagant. It&#39;s lucky that we&#39;ve even found out this much. We should be thinking of countermeasures.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas rebuked Dagruel for his complaint.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do we have an idea on who should deal with whom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Leon who said that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It might be a waste of time to decide, but it is not meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, at the very least, it would be best if Leon didn&#39;t have to deal with Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I agreed with Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That should absolutely not happen, as it would only lead to manipulation. Rather, we should cooperate with each other as much as possible to prevent such a situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was concerned about the possibility that not only Michael but also Feldway had the ability to control him, but after gathering various information, I found out how the skill worked to some extent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Listen, Michael&#39;s power is transferable, and it seems like he can give control to a certain level. That&rsquo;s why I think we need to keep Leon away from Feldway as well as Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just like with Lieutenant Kondou, Feldway should be considered to already have borrowed Michael&#39;s skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s annoying. If they take control of Leon as well, then the disparity between our forces will become even greater.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While I listened to Ruminas muttering, I remembered something else that I had forgotten to mention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah, Leon wasn&#39;t the only one in danger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmm? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, as I said, Veldora fell under the enemy&rsquo;s control during the battle the other day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;I&#39;ve been curious about that story. You should tell us more in detail.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas listened back with a stunned look on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I explained that Michael had the power of absolute control called the &ldquo;Regalia Dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for Chloe, she had already dealt with herself, so I&#39;ll put her on hold. If things got really bad, Ciel-san would have intervened forcibly, so I believe it&#39;s safe to leave her to her own devices.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, I explained about Veldora&#39;s situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru-kun.

It was like a shogi game where only one of the sides had the ability to reuse pieces, which was a condition that made it hard to imagine winning. It&#39;s my fault that I forgot to explain it, but I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s not an easy story for people to hear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, there is no one here who is being controlled by the &lsquo;Regalia Dominion?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. The control of one with an angelic skill doesn&#39;t seem to have any subjective symptoms, but in the case of &lsquo;Regalia Dominion,&rsquo; it is a forced dominion, so the ego disappears and the reaction is unnatural.

You don&#39;t seem to want to talk anyway, and you&#39;ve probably done something out of the ordinary.

That&#39;s why I was going to keep an eye on him, so Guy&#39;s decision was reasonable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that was the case, then I guess I didn&rsquo;t need to monitor him anymore&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru, you can afford it.

I could probably do it if I pushed myself, but I would feel more comfortable by just giving in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unless it was absolutely necessary, it was an unavoidable measure to follow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then, who would be the right people to send, and to where?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Someone who was good at teleportation and &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; from any location, was strong enough to endure on their own even if something happened, and was strong enough to resist domination. In that case, the three demon girls would be perfect for the job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Testarossa has been entrusted with the task of coordinating the affairs around the empire, so I don&#39;t think I can appoint her this time. Carrera and Ultima would be the main candidates.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After that, there would be some of the executives.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;First, Geld for Milim. We need to get construction going again, and they know each other, so it will be accepted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm! He is well-liked by everyone. Oh, by the way, Midley wanted to meet with Gabil as well. He said he&#39;d like to train with him again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see, that&#39;s a good idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had left Gabil&#39;s training to Ultima, but it had only been a few days and he was already looking at me as if about to cry. I might be able to send him over for a break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">In that case, Ultima would be a part of the package, and since we&#39;re still in wartime, there was no need for the police</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c0">. I could call them back immediately if necessary, so I think it would be okay to make the decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay. Then I&#39;ll send Geld, Gabil, and Ultima to Milim&#39;s territory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure, I&#39;m looking forward to it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With this, Milim&#39;s country was all set.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Next is Ruminas and the Holy Empire of Ruberios&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For Ruminas&hellip;do you have any requests on who to send?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m getting smarter. She would be furious if I said that I would send Veldora, so I figured I&#39;d better ask her before I stepped on a landmine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, you&rsquo;re right&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas thought about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was right to ask the question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a pause, Ruminas opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I like Shion, who you brought with you today. She has visited my country before, so I know her well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas had been raving about Shion&#39;s violin. It was no surprise that she remembered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I&#39;ll send Shion. I&#39;ll also send Adalman and his retinue with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Adalman was also acquainted with Ruminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There seemed to have been a falling out with the Seven Celestial Saints, but that was in the past now, so they should be fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. Since he&rsquo;s caused me so much trouble, it might be fun to give him some guidance myself.

I think I also have the right to refuse!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The expression on his face was very desperate, showing his determination not to step back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In contrast, Leon was smiling very calmly. It was as if he was saying, &ldquo;I&#39;m glad Carrera didn&#39;t go to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Listen, Rimuru. If you send that ruffian to me, my Damargania will be destroyed. I don&#39;t need much, but can you at least choose someone with a gentler personality?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Character is more important than strength,&rsquo; Dagruel complained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if you say that, so many of my subordinates are troublemakers&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I asked him about the situation in detail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that Dagruel&#39;s country is a decaying sanctuary called the &ldquo;Holy Void&rdquo; Damargania. It is a country with few resources, and many of its buildings have been swallowed by the sand and are in ruins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Dagruel&#39;s image of Carrera was the worst of all&mdash;a vandal who enjoys shooting out nuclear magic as a hobby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel&#39;s perception of Carrera is that she is worse than Milim&#39;s second epithet, the Destroyer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not that bad&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She is!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree with Dagruel&rsquo;s words.

In addition, even the taciturn Leon spoke eloquently of Carrera&#39;s many wrongdoings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have no choice but to believe what they say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In that case, I think Carrera should go to Leon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They seem to know each other, and Guy will also be at Leon&#39;s place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought it was a good idea because Carrera would not be able to do anything too crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop messing around! Were you even listening to me!? I absolutely refuse! That demon is the only one I&#39;ll never let set foot in my country!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Dagruel smiled, but Leon refused. The tone of his voice changed from &ldquo;I&rdquo; to &ldquo;me</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo; in a fit of rage, and he seemed to be completely out of control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was funny, so I was determined to send Carrera to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it was Guy who put a stop to that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru, you can&#39;t send Carrera.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She tries to fight me all the time, and when she thinks she&#39;s going to lose, she just throws the match and runs away, you know? This battle is not a game. I don&#39;t want to waste my energy. You understand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a good point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Guy&#39;s eyes were serious, as evidenced by the unprecedented intensity in his voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If Carrera is absolutely obedient to your orders and you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for anything that happens, I&#39;ll consider it. But that&rsquo;s impossible, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmm, well, I&#39;m not so sure about that. I&rsquo;d be able to stop her if I was around, but I don&#39;t know what Carrera would do if I took my eyes off her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. Carrera-chan is the one who&#39;s trying to make the game of &ldquo;how many levels can you break through?&rdquo; popular in my labyrinth. It&#39;s really annoying so I want you to stop it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such violence&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As expected, it seems that some damage has been done without my knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m going to ask Diablo for his oversight on this matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, I&rsquo;ll think about it while lightly trying to evade the responsibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahahaha! I liked Carrera and the others. I&#39;d like to see her, so she can come to my country as my guest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, what a nice offer from Milim!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s okay, Milim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well then, problem solved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll send Carrera to Milim&#39;s country, and Ultima to Dagruel&#39;s country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san may be angry with Milim later, but that&#39;s none of my business. Let&#39;s just get this over with before Milim changes her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, I&#39;ll send Ultima and Carrera from Milim&#39;s place to Dagruel&#39;s country in turns. It&#39;s a familiar homeland, so I&#39;m sure Ultima won&#39;t have a problems with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hate that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Okay then, it&rsquo;s decided. Dagruel, since that&#39;s the case, make sure to get along with Ultima!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy also gave the &lsquo;OK.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel was about to say something, but we agreed that it was just our imagination, and the matter was settled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, it was decided who to send to Ruminas, Milim, and Dagruel. The only question left was who to send to El Dorado, Leon&#39;s golden territory&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If Guy&#39;s going there, why should I send one of my men? Guy can keep an eye on Leon, and I don&#39;t see the need to reduce my country&#39;s strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was what I wanted to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why should I reduce my country&#39;s strength when a war is about to start?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, the three demon girls can be teleported right back to me if something happens, or at the worst, I can summon them myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for Geld, there was the reason why the construction could not be interrupted indefinitely, and Gabil was also Geld&#39;s bodyguard. In terms of simple combat ability, Geld is the stronger of the two. However, since Geld&#39;s main role is defense, it is advantageous to have an attacker.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this respect, Gabil is excellent in both offense and defense, so I thought it would be interesting to pair him up with Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for Adalman and his followers, I wanted them to concentrate on defending the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was worried about sending Shion alone to Ruminas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her strength alone was fine, but her behavior was not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Adalman knows all sorts of magic and can use teleportation as a matter of course. Adalman had met Ruminas and was expected to be polite to her, so I think this appointment was appropriate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what was confirmed so far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no one left to send to Leon&#39;s country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, hey, don&#39;t be shy. Your country is full of awakened beings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There are. But I need them to protect my country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re worrying too much. You&rsquo;ve got Veldora, so don&#39;t be stingy. Hey, how about that Benimaru guy? He&#39;s good, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course not! Benimaru&#39;s a newlywed. Moreover, he&#39;s got two wives! Both of them are pregnant, so he can&#39;t be expected to take an extended business trip during such a critical time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Benimaru is a monster, so it&#39;s okay&mdash;&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t even laugh at that joke. Unless, of course, he wanted to go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the days when lifetime employment was the norm, people would go on long business trips at the worst possible times in order to measure their loyalty to the company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For example, just after marriage or just after building a house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Most of the orders I had heard about were practically harassment, unless they had a meaning. In this day and age, companies that did such stupid things would probably end up going out of business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyway, Benimaru is no good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tsk, that doesn&#39;t make any sense, but whatever. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Diablo can go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I forgot about it since he&rsquo;s always stuck so close to me, but since I&rsquo;m sending Shion, I should also send Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If I sent away only one of them, they&rsquo;d get in a fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My real secretary was Shuna, so I wouldn&rsquo;t feel inconvenienced by their absence, so I think that&rsquo;s the best choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Diablo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. He&#39;s strong, so just him is enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Rimuru-kun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Guy started speaking to me with a purr</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c0">, but I figured it was just a bunch of nonsense. That&rsquo;s why, I ignored him and began wrapping up the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;re in a tough spot right now, too. I don&#39;t have any extra resources to play with. Even so, I&rsquo;m sending you our ace, so I hope that you&rsquo;ll accept it in good faith.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For someone like Guy, it&#39;s better to just tell him the decision rather than to negotiate with him. I did so, remembering my past experience as a general contractor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Specifically, I referred to the case where the general manager had successfully refused to negotiate with a JV (a construction joint venture) that was insisting on being sent more staff. While appealing that he could not afford to do so, he refused to increase the number of employees because he had already selected excellent personnel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From the other party&rsquo;s point of view, there were many situations where they had wanted to say, &lsquo;We need more staff because your staff is incompetent!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a common understanding between everyone, including myself, that there was not a fragment of sincerity in that place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, it really depended on your luck whether you were really good or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would have been interesting if there had been a system of appointing employees from amongst the government or subcontractors (a reverse nomination system), so that they could be evaluated. Well, it&#39;s useless to think about it now, and the most important thing was to push Diablo to Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bastard&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I waited for his reply with an air of dignity, but inwardly my heart was pounding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Che, you&#39;re getting thicker by the minute. Well, whatever. I&#39;ll just put up with Diablo this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Phew&mdash;I won!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t care who it is. Normally I would want to take Chloe, but that&rsquo;s just the way things are. Oh yeah, if Rimuru wants, he can come to my country with Diablo. I promised to invite you before, but I haven&#39;t been able to do so yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before I could bask in the afterglow of my victory, Leon made a suggestion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if taking Chloe is out of the question, I might consider paying a visit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay. I&#39;ll leave Chloe, but I&#39;ll visit you later if the schedule permits. I&#39;ll contact you through Diablo if that&#39;s the case, so thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To begin with, Chloe was absolute bed rest so I couldn&rsquo;t move her. I didn&rsquo;t know how Leon would react if I told him that, so I thought it best to keep quiet about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, I decided to just accept the invitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It may not be the best time to do so considering the current situation, but it&rsquo;s boring to just wait for Michael to make his move. As soon as I&#39;m ready, I&#39;ll gradually return to my daily life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well. I&#39;ll look forward to hearing from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. Well, if Diablo gives you any trouble, just let me know. I&#39;ll be there to educate him without a thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well. I won&rsquo;t hesitate to call, so make sure he&#39;s taken care of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though he hadn&#39;t done anything yet, I was reminded by Guy, and not Leon. I was curious about their relationship, but it seemed troublesome, so I decided it would be better not to know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, our future plans were decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, then I&rsquo;m head over to Leon&#39;s place, so each of you just do what you have to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy declared as such as he returned to the hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, hey, so no explanation for us, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I received an explanation from Mizari, but I&#39;d at least like to know what the plan is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion and Frey-san were the ones who spoke up to Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought that was a fair point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy is too hasty in his conclusions. He thinks he&#39;s the only one who needs to be convinced, so he leaves the others behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, there was no way that Guy would explain the situation properly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And not only Guy, but also the childish Milim and Ramiris, the sloppy Dagruel and Leon, and the uncaring Ruminas, were all similar and were unlikely to volunteer for such trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I decided to be the adult and explain it to everyone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is what we just discussed, but you were already briefed on the enemy, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I heard that Velzard turned against us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Apparently so. And the reason wasn&#39;t betrayal or anything like that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, this time I summarized the story and explained the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, it was a good thing that only the seven of us attended the meeting. If the subordinates had also joined in, it would have been much more difficult to move the discussion forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy&#39;s decision to anticipate this was correct, and I realized that it was his long years of experience that made a difference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thinking about it, it must have also been hard for Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As one can see from the other demon lords, they each have their own peculiarities. It must have taken a lot of mental strength and difficulty to bring them together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While re-evaluating Guy in this way, I finished my explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I knew it wasn&#39;t like you to flounder around like this, but it turned out to be more troublesome than I expected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san was dumbfounded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not that she couldn&rsquo;t handle it exactly, it&#39;s just that she didn&#39;t want to hear it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s true. Now that I&rsquo;ve got the power, I&rsquo;d like to see how far I can go against a True Dragon, but I doubt I&rsquo;d have a chance against Velzard-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion made a fearless remark, but his forehead was sweating profusely. He was probably trying to figure out what was going on and what he could even do to overcome it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kuahahaha! You said it, Karion. Even I&#39;ve never been able to defeat my sister. If you want to try, let me be your opponent first!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Master. I don&#39;t think this is the time. If you don&#39;t take things seriously, Rimuru will get angry at you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I probably should have been angry, but on the contrary, now I felt saved by Veldora&#39;s light-hearted words. While we were talking so seriously, the situation had felt so bad that it made me depressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. Then, in order to counter the domination, you&#39;re going to concentrate your forces as much as possible. So, this Regalia Dominion be resisted?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If your will is strong enough, it can be resisted. In Veldora&#39;s case, he was targeted when his resistance was weakened by a surprise attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. The original me would have been able to withstand it, but I was in the middle of a battle with my sister at the time. It was a little tough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was tough&mdash;or rather, you were dominated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s useless to try and pretend that it didn&#39;t happen, so I wish you&rsquo;d just admit it honestly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While I was dumbfounded at Veldora, Dagruel spoke to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Rimuru, why don&#39;t you send Veldora to me instead? I&#39;m not a big fan of Vio&mdash;Ultima</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c0">, but Veldora is a familiar face, and I know him well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was suggesting that we change the dispatched subordinates, but unfortunately the answer was still no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, I can&#39;t do that. Veldora&#39;s not my subordinate, he&#39;s my friend. I can&#39;t just decide for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he&#39;s okay with it, then it&#39;s none of my business. But in this situation, I can&#39;t just ignore Veldora&#39;s wishes and go ahead with the discussion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I checked with him for the time being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Veldora, you were invited, so what will you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Veldora laughed but refused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kukuku. Dagruel, as much as I&#39;d like to go and rescue you, I&#39;m busy as well. I have a job to do, which is guarding the labyrinth of Ramiris!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You just want to slack off&hellip;I knew it as soon as I saw Veldora declaring that he would act as usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Master!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was too bad for Ramiris, who was crying out with watery eyes, but I&#39;m absolutely sure that Veldora was just trying to take it easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, well, that&#39;s a shame. Even for me, there&rsquo;d be a lot of trouble if I was attacked by Velzard. It would have been reassuring if you could have helped me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kuhaha, Kuahahaha, Kuaaaahahahah! Well, you know. A man as strong as me has nothing to fear from my sister. Too bad! It&rsquo;s a shame indeed, Dagruel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&#39;s so obviously vain, this one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But well, Velzard seems to be really dangerous, and I&#39;m glad Veldora said no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I feel bad for Dagruel, but my priority is the security of my country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dagruel is right. I&#39;ve never fought Velzard, but my gut tells me she&rsquo;s a dangerous opponent. If she comes here, I&#39;ll have to deal with her. You should be prepared to call for backup immediately, because you won&#39;t be able to do anything else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim, who had been listening to our conversation, made a very good point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a realistic suggestion, unlike the normally overconfident Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To put it another way, Velzard was trouble, and since it was unlikely that she would attack alone, we agreed that we should also avoid acting alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san and the others seemed to agree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. Well then, let&#39;s make sure that we don&#39;t act on our own either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, do that! Then Rimuru, I want you to bring Geld and the others to me as soon as possible. If you want, I can pick them up myself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. I&#39;ll explain the situation when I get back and have them ready for you right away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Geld can be reached by Teleport, so there was no need to rush. I was going to explain the situation to the executives first, and it shouldn&#39;t be too late to send them out after we had come to a common understanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave it to you, Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. If the enemy attacks, I&#39;ll contact you immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t explain that Carrera was being sent, but Frey-san doesn&#39;t seem to know what primordials were. I didn&rsquo;t think there was any need to tell her, so I ended the conversation peacefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, when it comes to stalling Velzard, there was no reason to complain about throwing in a Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But what I am curious about is Michael and the others&rsquo; purpose. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just to take over this world&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Louis who asked that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that. It&#39;s the resurrection of Veldanava. Michael and Feldway are working for the Lord&#39;s resurrection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Haah!?&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I explained this, those who hadn&#39;t yet heard about it screamed in astonishment. The information was known to my companions, but it seemed that it was quite a shock to the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Rimuru is right. That&#39;s what Obera, my collaborator, told me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Milim affirmed as such, Karion muttered in frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously&hellip;I didn&#39;t just hear that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh, didn&#39;t you know about it? I thought I already told you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you didn&#39;t. Well, Midley&#39;s just as guilty as me on this one. You&#39;ll have to tell me more later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as I was reconsidering Milim, this is what happens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I heard that Milim and Midley had met with Obera, but it seems that their conversation was not well communicated. That&#39;s why we have to make it a habit to report, communicate and consult on a regular basis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;Is what I thought. I&#39;m not in a position to speak so highly when I had also forgot to tell them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Louis spoke with a thoughtful expression while Milim and the others were talking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A True Dragon is immortal. There is no need to worry over it because he will eventually come back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yes. It&#39;s normal to think so, but Michael is an ego that arose from a Skill. Because he&#39;s an impossible existence, he must be thinking in ways that ordinary people can&#39;t comprehend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruminas shakes her head, as if she doesn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy, however, seems to think a little differently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That said, it&#39;s true that Veldanava has shown no signs of resurrection. I can see why Feldway might think it&#39;s okay for the world to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy boasted that he believed Veldanava to be immortal because he had fought him once before. On top of that, he said that he could understand why people adored Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But, you know, once you die, some of your memories and personality will be affected, right? That seems like a different person to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;As for that, it&rsquo;s a matter of personal feelings</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c0">. I feel like they are the same person. After all, they would possess the same soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I don&#39;t know. Velgrynd-san also said &lsquo;I don&#39;t care if Rudra is reincarnated as a bad guy or a good guy,&rsquo; but I thought that was something I should care about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahahaha! You&#39;re still caught up in the stereotypes you had when you were a human. Well, you&#39;ll understand eventually.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It doesn&#39;t make sense to me, but from the perspective of a long-lived species, the idea of right and wrong may be just a mood of the moment. If that&#39;s the case, I will keep my thoughts in mind and cherish them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, no, but then what would happen if I got involved in something evil? It would be exactly what the late Mariabell had feared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, I am a selfish person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I have to make sure that I don&#39;t act on my own and bring chaos to the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I still like to do whatever I want, but I&#39;m only working for a better world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I swore to myself that I would never do anything to make others unhappy just for my own amusement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I was asking myself if this was okay, Guy spoke to me as if he had just remembered something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By the way, Rimuru, I was just wondering&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nn? I don&#39;t think I have anything else to hide anymore though?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I doubt that, but that&#39;s okay. I was just curious about Michael&#39;s thoughts. How is he going to bring Veldanava back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy pressed me to tell him what I knew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&lsquo;How the hell should I know?&rsquo;&mdash;is what I was about to say when I remembered something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, now that I think about it, he was saying something about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. He mentioned it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I muttered, and Veldora, who was listening along, nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, I think&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kufufufu. They seem to believe that if they take in the power of the three &ldquo;True Dragons,&rdquo; Veldanava-sama will be revived with all of the &ldquo;Dragon Factors.&rdquo; I think it is foolish, but can we be absolutely sure that it wouldn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo explained it before I could remember.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right, I remembered it was something like that. I had forgotten about it because it didn&#39;t seem realistic at the time and I didn&#39;t think such a method would be successful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, the &ldquo;Dragon Factor&rdquo; was the key.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;If it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;Dragon Factor,&rdquo; Master has also acquired it&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, I&#39;ve become a &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo; of sorts, haven&#39;t I? So then, it&#39;s not surprising that I have the &ldquo;Dragon Factor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Be that as it may&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Velzard, Velgrynd, and Veldora. Even if you collect the &ldquo;Dragon Factor&rdquo; from all three True Dragons, it&#39;s meaningless if the most important factor, Veldanava&#39;s, is missing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the soul is different, then it&#39;s a different person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">According to Diablo, it&#39;s not impossible, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah? It&rsquo;s absurd, that theory. Even if you could recreate him, it would only be a pseudo-body, and while they might be able to imitate his skills, they wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with the soul which is the most essential part.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy interjected, seemingly to be of the same opinion as I was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just that we can&#39;t deny the possibility that the lost soul could come back if they have a perfected body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess. Veldanava is a complete spiritual life form, so I don&#39;t think his soul was scattered like Rudra&#39;s. You&#39;re right, it is possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmm, that theory still doesn&#39;t make sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;There is no reason to come back. In the first place, Veldanava should be capable of regenerating his body himself if he intends to return&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since Ciel-san denied it, I was confidently skeptical of the enemy&#39;s plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, it&#39;ll probably fail anyway, so if we just ignore it&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. Then the enemy&#39;s goal may be Veldora.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone in the room stopped moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fuah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Veldora&#39;s dumb mumbling echoed through the silent hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He seemed to have no idea what that meant but was leaving it to chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s more important now is what Ruminas had pointed out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oops, that&#39;s a blind spot. Veldora was taken over once before, but they didn&#39;t take away the Dragon Factor at the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I guess it&#39;s not the success rate that matters to Michael, only the possibility of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, regardless of whether Veldanava would be resurrected or not, there was a good chance that Veldora&#39;s Dragon Factor would be targeted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not good, I hadn&#39;t thought of the situation where Velzard would be taken over, so I feel like I&#39;m way behind the times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. Obera also said that Emperor Rudra&mdash;in other words Michael, had taken over Velgrynd&#39;s Dragon Factor. Now that Velzard is under control, all that remains is Veldora!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, hold on a second. What do you mean? Are you saying that Velzard will also lose her Dragon Factor!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy reacted to Milim&#39;s comment with a bit of panic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So I just said what I thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what makes sense?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then Guy showed an unusually agitated expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In that case, Velzard won&#39;t be safe. She&rsquo;s good enough to fight me on equal terms, but she might just disappear?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I wonder about that. In Velgrynd&#39;s case, one of her &#39;Parallel Existences&#39; was absorbed. I think the amount of magicules was probably less than 10%, but that alone was just enough for Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After hearing this explanation, Guy regained his composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I guess so. The power of a &ldquo;True Dragon&rdquo; is immense, so they can&#39;t be absorbed that easily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the time, Velgrynd had suffered considerable damage from Carrera&#39;s &ldquo;Judgment,&rdquo; but she still had a considerable amount of power left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">In fact, Michael had taken in Velgrynd&#39;s power with Yuuki&#39;s skill &lsquo;Still Life,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rsquo; but he could not absorb it completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition, I also had an idea of why Michael had banished Velgrynd from this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Also, it&#39;s not just the strength and factors that are taken away, but also the skills. Doing so would remove the absolute control over the angelic skill system, so if he doesn&rsquo;t act carefully, he&#39;ll get struck with a counterattack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why Michael would want to use Velzard to weaken her, and then take the factor away and banish her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;I agree&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, sometimes I can be quite brilliant as well.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But why would he need to take away their powers?

I was in a very important position, wasn&#39;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t help but be annoyed at Veldora who said stupid things without even taking the discussion seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Currently, we were behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We had to admit that, but we could make up for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Veldora had nothing to do with the Angelic system and had already escaped the control of the &ldquo;Regalia Dominion.&rdquo; The enemy was probably aware of this, so their next move would probably be a straightforward one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that happened, it would be an all-out war, so I think the first priority would be to bring the angelic owners together first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it were me, I would definitely act cautiously, but I didn&#39;t know which strategy Michael would mainly adopt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But there was no rush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no doubt that the enemy&#39;s main objective was Veldora, so we could take steps to prevent it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the worst case scenario, it might be a good idea to eliminate Leon&#39;s &ldquo;control circuit,&rdquo; though I didn&#39;t want to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I wish you all the best.

No wonder he was able to tame the primordials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had freed Velgrynd and Veldora who were under control and defied the odds. Even though Michael and the others had escaped, it was not an exaggeration to say that the situation was in fact a great victory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just so I know, Leon-kun isn&#39;t trying to trick me with a lie, is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have no reason to lie to you.

I know it&#39;s not something you can talk about on a cell phone, but I really should have asked for more details.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elmesia&#39;s face remained unchanged as she regretted her mistake of being nothing but relieved to hear that he had won.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Still, it was helpful</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;that Veldora remained friendly and Velgrynd became an ally, wasn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As far as I can tell, it&#39;s a wonder he&#39;s still alive.

Even I can&#39;t do that, so why should Leon-kun be so self-deprecating?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being self-deprecating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">More importantly, Leon wanted to get back to the topic at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whenever Elmesia is around, she will tease you at every possible moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In order to avoid that this time, he decided to quickly tell her what he wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The situation is as I explained. With that in mind, I&#39;d like you to get in touch with Master.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mother, hey&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She understood what Leon was saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As long as he possessed the Ultimate Skill &#39;Purity King (Metatron)&#39;, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to escape Michael&#39;s control. They had to do something about it before the enemy found out that he possessed the power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For that purpose, Elmesia&#39;s knowledge alone was not enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Considering the gravity of the situation, he had decided that the highest wisdom of Sarion needed to be mobilized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia was a free spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">She was also Sarion&#39;s greatest force</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was also very good at covert action, making if difficult to locate Silvia if she was hiding.

For certain reasons, Elmesia had never really thought it to be inconvenient.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, it was not often that they had to rely on Silvia to solve a problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was also that secret method to use when they were in a real pinch, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s no good?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elmesia let out a sigh as Leon asked her straight out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Silvia&#39;s apprentice, Leon was like a little brother to Elmesia. She was hesitant to turn down his request.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll do my best, but in the worst case, you&#39;ll have to wait about six months.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;All right. That&#39;s fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as he said so, Leon stood up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m finished here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Elmesia smiled, wishing that he could just take it easy</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;sometimes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such a clumsy way of life, she thought it was just like Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After Leon left, Elmesia set out to keep her promise to Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She called the royal guards and ordered an emergency call for Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, Elmesia and Silvia are identical in appearance. Therefore, they had a secret where they could secure free time by taking turns playing the role of the emperor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahh, she&rsquo;s going to hate me for sure&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it were herself, she would have been furious that someone had taken away her free time. That&#39;s why she felt that her mother&#39;s anger was understandable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was willing to put up with the complaining this time around, but she still didn&rsquo;t think that the choice was wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, this was an unprecedented situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From what she had heard, even Demon Lord Guy had agreed to escort Leon.

When Ciel-san told me this, I had asked if we could communicate through it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;It&#39;s easy&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t help the blank look on my face when I was told that so simply, but I suppose I should have welcomed it if I could.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I immediately contacted Dino and stuck it right to him</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, as far as Dino was concerned, I&rsquo;d rather have him near the enemy. Even though he had been doing some chores for Ramiris, I couldn&#39;t shake the thought that he would just be a waste of money even if he was on our side. It would be more helpful if he could give us information while in the enemy camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I have said before, &lsquo;what one should really fear is not a competent enemy, but an incompetent ally.&rsquo; This is exactly the case with Dino, who has contributed to us simply by being on the enemy side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, the contents of the conversation we had at that time&mdash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey!

Moreover, you even plotted to kidnap Ramiris, didn&#39;t you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I smirked and cornered Dino.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Well, you see, I had to do it because I was ordered&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just tell you that I don&#39;t want to hear any excuses?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yes, I&#39;m sorry&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was hard to tell which of us was the villain here, but I&#39;m a demon lord, so it&rsquo;s fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Dino was also a demon lord, so my conscience remained conveniently unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s reaction was sluggish, as if realizing that he was in the wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Taking advantage of the opportunity, I began to negotiate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&lsquo;&lsquo;Normally, this would have been an unforgivable act, but I am willing to ignore it just this once.

Of course, I&rsquo;m sorry. It&#39;s just that I have my own problems, and this is what happened. You understand that, don&#39;t you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Mm-hmm, I do. It&#39;s just that Dino-kun was under Michael&#39;s control.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&mdash;Eh?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I thought, he wasn&rsquo;t aware of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Dino&#39;s inherently lazy personality probably helped him this time, as he didn&rsquo;t seem to have much loyalty to Michael, the ruler.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Wai&mdash;hold on! Seriously!? I&rsquo;m being controlled?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yup, you are. I didn&rsquo;t think it was your decision to do that, either.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After saying that, I told him about Michael&#39;s ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is. I&#39;m assuming that you have an angelic skill too, am I wrong?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;No way&hellip;It&rsquo;s true that I do have the Ultimate Skill &ldquo;Heavenly King Astarte&hellip;&rdquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s skill is &lsquo;Heavenly King Astarte.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not sure what it does, but it seems that it is an angelic skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;That&#39;s it, then. That&#39;s why you&#39;re being manipulated by Michael without even realizing it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Based on Dino&#39;s reaction, letting him know that he was under control could be a good thing or a bad thing. He did not seem to be completely under control to the point of swearing allegiance, so it might be easier for the domination to fall apart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s character might also be a factor, but I had a feeling that he would be able to break through this well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;What should I do? Listening to you, I don&#39;t feel angry at Michael. I don&#39;t feel like betraying him, and I don&#39;t feel like joining you guys. I didn&#39;t realize it until now, but it&#39;s definitely a weird feeling.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With this, I was able to find out Dino&#39;s skills and also make him aware of everything. This contact seems to have been a great success.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But anyway, I&rsquo;ll take my chances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Well, I have a hypothesis. If you have a demonic skill that opposes an angelic skill, you might be able to offset them and escape from their control. There are other ways to do this, but I don&#39;t recommend them because they depend on luck.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for the offset theory, Chloe is an example.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because she had the Manas named Chronoa, Chloe herself was not controlled. I heard that she had lost contact with Chronoa now, but from what I saw, she had fought and struggled to remove the &ldquo;control circuit&rdquo; from &lsquo;Hope King (Sariel).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wanted to help, but I trust them and will let them do what they want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, it&rsquo;s just a matter of luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s a lie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust Dino, but he is still under control. I&#39;m not stupid enough to reveal all of my tricks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Actually, with Leon, I had a feeling that Ciel-san would take care of things if used &#39;Predation&#39; on him. But just the thought of that was unpleasant, so I was saving it as a last resort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I told Dino that there was only a possibility that I could do something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&hellip;I see. It doesn&#39;t feel good being controlled, so I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t do something about it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey, hey, don&rsquo;t overdo it. Michael and us demon lords are going to have an all-out war, so I want you to do nothing and stay out of suspicion.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if I could get information from Dino such as by asking him to spy, I wouldn&rsquo;t fully believe him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The effect of Zegion&#39;s curse was not enough to prevent him from telling lies, and even if he could, it would be useless if he told Michael about what was reported to us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since I was not sure which effect was greater, Zegion&#39;s coercion or Michael&#39;s control, I thought it was dangerous to rely on uncertain information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even so!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be a waste to let Dino fool around here!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather, it is unacceptable that we&rsquo;d be the only ones who were struggling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Is that all right?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino looks happy to be told not to do anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&#39;s such a sweet guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no reason for me to be kind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I also thought it would be hard for you to betray Michael.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I replied in a gentle tone as if I cared about Dino, but I was secretly ready to make him work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;No, I don&#39;t want to betray him, but I don&rsquo;t care at all about leaking information!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hey, is this really okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t think I can trust this guy on a fundamental level&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, this is fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s best to have him act in our favor to the extent that he doesn&#39;t even feel like he&#39;s betraying us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;No, it&#39;s okay. You don&#39;t have to do anything.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Seriously? Then, what about that sincerity thing you were talking about earlier?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve been doing a good job of leading the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems I was right to use Dino&#39;s innocent nature to get him to act voluntarily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Even if you don&#39;t join the battle, that&rsquo;s almost like having Michael&#39;s strength reduced.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I see, that is true!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a little annoying that he was convinced by that, but because it&rsquo;s Dino, I feel like it&#39;s forgivable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I see, if you say so. Then I&#39;ll let you know if there&#39;s anything you need hear about.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;That would help.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All right, now he&rsquo;ll be able to be a spy without being aware of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Okay, I&#39;ll keep an eye on things, so let me know if you need anything. Is that okay?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yeah, that&#39;s fine. By the way, what&#39;s Michael doing now? Do you have any idea of when he might be ready to move?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having succeeded in getting Dino to talk, I asked him what I wanted to know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I could tell when he was lying, so as long as Dino didn&#39;t tell on me, the information would be reliable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yeah, I think he&#39;s asleep now. You see, he got Velgrynd&#39;s power and also took Velzard&#39;s power. I guess the strain of that took its toll and he went dormant.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whoa, that&#39;s some great information right there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had thought he would weaken Velzard before making his move, that impatient bastard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, I heard she fought Guy, so she might have been a little weakened. But it seemed that neither of them had fought seriously, so it must have been too much for Michael to handle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the Dragon Factor was taken from her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s possible that Michael has changed in some way, so we should be on our guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What I am wondering about is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;What happened to Velzard?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Velzard is recovering, too. She will probably be back to normal in a few days.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I guess the possibility of being attacked out of nowhere has disappeared, but a True Dragon&#39;s resilience is unbelievable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, I&#39;d like to think that there won&#39;t be a full-scale invasion until Michael, the commander, is back to normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Okay, thanks.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;For this, it&#39;s a small price to pay.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were many more questions I wanted to ask, such as the number of enemies, but I decided not to go any further.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be better to be satisfied with Dino&#39;s willingness to speak up, because he would be a long-lasting source of information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Okay then, I&#39;ll be in touch.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh&hellip;I just remembered. It would be helpful if you could tell Ramiris that I&#39;m sorry.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just as I was about to end the conversation, Dino asked me for a favor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, I briskly declined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Ah? You can apologize yourself later. She was pretty angry and said that she was going to use all forty-eight of her special moves on you.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Forty-eight my ass! All she can do is dropkicks!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s just what she said. Didn&#39;t I tell you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I said that, it seemed like Dino was laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Fufu. I understand. See you later.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yeah, see ya.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With Dino&#39;s approval, I broke the connection this time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And that was about it for the exchange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It went well, I&#39;d say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had already shared this story with the demon lords, with the caveat that Dino was an informant. That&#39;s why we did not have to feel tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t deny the possibility that the whole thing was a trap, but if I did that, I&rsquo;d be just like Ciel-san. It was no fun being overly cautious and losing your nerve, plus that would be like falling into the enemy&#39;s trap, so I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to be natural.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, that was still the same decision I made when I heard that the angels were coming to attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had always been the type of person who did what I could do tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For example, whenever I had summer vacation homework, I would do my best in the beginning and finish the rest on the last day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And if I didn&rsquo;t get it done in time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that time, I would go straight to school without hesitation and announce &lsquo;I forgot,&rsquo; at which point they would get mad at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If I was told to bring it in tomorrow, then I would finish what I could, and if I couldn&#39;t, next I would say &lsquo;I lost it.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I had done my best because I had wanted to finish it as much as possible, but I think it is important to accept that which is impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eh, do my best on a regular basis?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No way, it&rsquo;s about focusing the mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So then, as long as you are prepared to get someone angry, the rest is manageable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, you have to take responsibility for your own actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But I&rsquo;ve digressed from the topic at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I asked Dino to call me every morning to see if Michael had woken up or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael shouldn&rsquo;t be able to see everything. He seems to be able to manipulate the skills of his subjects, but I don&#39;t think he can read their thoughts. If that were possible, he would have to process a huge amount of information, and that would make it more difficult to extract only the necessary information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I do not believe that a person who cannot even tell a lie to himself would go that far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rationale behind that thought was Ciel-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Ciel-san asserted that although it was possible to speak with someone connected by the &lsquo;Soul Corridor,&rsquo; it was impossible to read their every thought. While one might sometimes be able to sense their surface psychology, it is impossible to interfere with what someone is thinking deep inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, I have heard that you can see the answer to a question if you ask it directly, but I have some idea about that. I always tried to be cautious, because I felt that my thoughts were often seen through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For that reason, I placed a certain level of trust in Dino&#39;s information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, during the last five months when Michael had not moved, we had been preparing for the final battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We had established a system of mutual cooperation amongst us demon lords, and were holding detailed discussions with each of our territories so that we&rsquo;d be able to deal with any problems as soon as they arose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">And by us, I meant me.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt62" id="ftnt_ref62">[62]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The agreement to go and help the others if possible was meaningful to me, but it had been very difficult to coordinate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Just by looking at that exhausting banquet</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt63" id="ftnt_ref63">[63]</a></sup><span class="c0">, one would understand how difficult it was to meet with demon lords who were so selfish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">First, as promised, I was constructing a &ldquo;magic transfer circle&rdquo; in each demon lord&#39;s territory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After Walpurgis, I had asked Mizari to take me to each of the demon lords&#39; countries. I recorded those locations so that I could teleport to them immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, the demon lords had all agreed to this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I already knew Guy&#39;s castle, the &lsquo;Frost Palace,&rsquo; since it had been the meeting place at the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had also already been to Ruminas&rsquo; Holy Empire of Ruberios, and its capital, the Sacred City of &lsquo;Runes.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had visited the still-unnamed country of Milim many times, so I really only had to visit two places, El Dorado (the Golden Land) and Damargania (the Holy Void).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel&rsquo;s territory was like a decaying sanctuary. If I had more time, I would have liked to take a leisurely tour, but work took priority at the time. I left immediately and made arrangements to dispatch Ultima and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, I found out from the conversation that Milim and Dagruel could not teleport.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Needless to say, neither could Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&#39;m not good at that kind of thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me too! It&#39;s faster to just fly than to do those troublesome coordinate calculations!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what they both said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is true that transportation type magic can only transfer you to a location that has been recorded. In the case of the skill &lsquo;Spatial Transportation,&rsquo; it is more flexible, but the coordinates of your current location and your destination&mdash;an accurate depiction (image)&mdash;are required or else the skill won&rsquo;t be activated. It is necessary to understand the correlation between the positional information and to calculate the angle and distance to jump.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It may look like an easy transition, but there is a time lag, and it is a surprisingly complicated skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim acts by instinct and natural intuition, and is not good at intentional calculation. Her computational ability is very high, but it seems that she is not good at it because she finds it troublesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel is the physical type as one can see&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Ramiris, well, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The construction of the &ldquo;magic transfer circles&rdquo; had been a request from Guy, but they might also come in handy in the future. Leon and Ruminas could do whatever they wanted with their magic and skills, but the fact that they didn&#39;t oppose the installation suggests that they must have seen the usefulness of this device.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, it could be used by anyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, even people with very little magic power could use it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using the magicules collected from the atmosphere, it was possible to transfer nearly fifty people at once. This would make it easier to travel to and from countries where magic circles have been set up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the future, we could prepare a larger scale system, but there was still a problem in terms of efficiency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As you know, a large number of magicules are required to transfer organisms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we waited for the magicules to be replenished naturally, then it would take a week to use it once. It was easy to replenish the amount of magicules if the person had as many as we did, but it would be a lot of work for humans to do so with their magic power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it was used to transport goods, then that could start a distribution revolution. If that happened, the &ldquo;magic train&rdquo; we were working so hard to develop would become obsolete, and there&rsquo;d be a lot of problems to solve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The word &ldquo;compartmentalization&rdquo; came to mind, and so I decided to leave the effective utilization of this device as a future task.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;For that reason, I was installing &ldquo;magic transfer circles,&rdquo; though as a matter of fact, I had already completed them in demon lord territories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s look back on the situation at that time&mdash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first one I installed was, of course, in my country of Tempest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just in case, I had it installed in the Isolation Room of the labyrinth. That way, it would be safe even if it was used by the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next one I installed was in the &ldquo;Holy Void,&rdquo; Damargania.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I went with Ultima and completed it myself with little choice in the matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Normally, I would have just left the work to others, but this time things were different. In addition to the fact that I could not afford to take my time, Damargania was a unique location.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A long time ago, the city had been reduced to ruins by the decisive battle between Guy and Milim. However, the tragedy of that battle still affected the city to this day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A barren land, a deadly desert. There were several reasons why it was called that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The raging sandstorm corroded everything it touched. This sandstorm isolated Damargania from the outside world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&laquo;</span><span class="c11 c22">At the time when the forces between Guy and Milim clashed, a catastrophic destruction occurred, and the energy was forcibly expelled to another dimension to minimize the damage</span><span class="c0">. However, that power has not disappeared, but continues to leak from the dimensional rupture. That is the cause of this tragedy&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was Ciel-san&#39;s explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was such a long time ago, I was surprised that it was still having an effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, such a dangerous place was the territory of Dagruel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">In Damargania, there was a huge tower&mdash;the &ldquo;Heavenward Pavilion</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;&mdash;that pierced the sky. Only the area surrounding it was a barely functional safe zone called the &ldquo;Holy Void.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Outside of the &lsquo;Barrier,&rsquo; which had existed since ancient times, there were threats that even rivaled the permafrost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Weak monsters would be sliced to death by sand blades, and even strong monsters would be at risk of death over long periods of time. Dagruel and the other giants were of no exception to this rule.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the weak, women, and children, even if they were high ranking warriors, there were many dangers outside the safety of the Holy Void.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If even the Giant race could be reduced to such a state, then for humans, this was truly a deadly place. That&#39;s why I did the work myself this time rather than sending for Vesta and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That said, all I really had to do was set up the &lsquo;magic circle.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The giant disk made of pure magisteel, engraved with magic formulas constructed by Ciel-san, was one meter high and seven meters in diameter, and was installed in the location specified by Dagruel. The rest of the work went to the demons who had come with Ultima.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is an order from Rimuru-sama! Do not embarrass me, and make sure you complete it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the demons were given a threatening pep talk from Ultima.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was mostly just threatening, but the demons were good at magic, so they could handle it. With that in mind, I left them in charge and retreated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru, are you sure it&rsquo;s alright&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel asked me anxiously&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, it&#39;s fine. There&rsquo;s Veyron as well as Ultima, and we can also call Zonda back if needed. The test was successful, so don&#39;t worry about leaving the rest of the adjustments to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, there was nothing to worry about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because Ultima and the others were big time demons despite their appearances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They probably had accumulated more wisdom than I could even imagine, so I finished the work without any worries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rather than that, I was just wondering whether they would go berserk&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, I&#39;m off! You take care of the rest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dagruel was about to say something, but I chose to ignore him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would only be a hassle to change personnel here, so I left the place as if to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After Damargania was Ruberios.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I set up a &lsquo;magic circle&rsquo; at the location Ruminas had specified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After that, it was worktime for Gobkyu and the Surmounters who had come with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If I just left things to Gobkyu, he would construct a magnificent building as a transfer facility. And with the help of the Surmounters, they could handle the fine-tuning of the relocation information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think this will work. I will keep in touch with Tempest and Damargania, and we will get it working up to a practical level!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that they were taking care of it, my work here was done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now, as for the other matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Shion, her subordinates, Adalman, and his followers were scheduled to arrive in Ruminas&#39; country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had brought them all together this time, but the problem was finding an inn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rest assured. There is an empty room in my temple, so you can sleep there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That would be a great help. Shion, Adalman, that&#39;s how it is, so don&#39;t cause any trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leave it to me, Rimuru-sama! As Rimuru-sama&#39;s secretary, I shall see to it that your duties are carried out in an unashamed manner!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;d rather you not do anything and just send me a message when the enemy attacked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s such a pity that I can&#39;t cook. They say that even one day without cooking can dull one&rsquo;s skills&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Isn&#39;t that for more delicate skills, like the piano?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Come to think of it, Shion is also good at the violin, so doesn&#39;t she need to practice that too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t you need to practice your instrument? You&rsquo;re so enthusiastic about combat training, but I never really see you playing the violin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Fufufu, don&rsquo;t worry. As long as you practice daily, playing an instrument is a piece of cake. It&#39;s more about the ability to make subtle changes of seasoning</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt65" id="ftnt_ref65">[65]</a></sup><span class="c0">&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This person&rsquo;s way of thinking is wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hid my disgusted expression, wondering if I should apologize to all the musicians in the country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Shion says it&#39;s all in the seasonings, but no matter how much you get it wrong, the taste will be guaranteed. However, too much salt is too salty, and too much sugar is just bad for your health. The correct answer is that the right amount is important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, it&rsquo;s clear that her concerns are misdirected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I was thinking this, Ruminas interjected from the side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shion, wasn&#39;t it? If it&#39;s combat training you&rsquo;re looking for, I&#39;m sure Hinata has some time. If you&rsquo;d like, I can do it too, so don&#39;t worry. Oh, and as for the cooking, I will give you an unused kitchen and arrange for the ingredients, so you can do as you please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was made speechless by her words. The offer was so fearless that I was trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was so startled that I was too late to stop her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ru-Ruminas, letting Shion cook for you is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I don&#39;t mind. In this day and age, hobbies should be cherished. I also had a passion for cooking at one time. Fufufu, it would be fun to try it with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well! That&#39;s a wonderful idea. I won&rsquo;t lose, Ruminas-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufu, Hinata is also very good at cooking. Let&rsquo;s invite her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s a lot to talk about here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I could no longer handle this, let alone having Hinata join in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t know what to do, so I left my luck to chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A-Adalman. I leave the rest to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He must have had some terrible premonition. Even Adalman, a man of great faith, could not nod his head in agreement with my words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, the die had been cast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, let me know if anything happens!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I left it at that and escaped on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The third destination was Milim&rsquo;s country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ruins of Yuurazania, which I knew quite well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What rose from there was not a sacred mountain, but a huge structure still under construction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I teleported to the site of the old city and waited for the pick-up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Geld had been sent ahead of me, so I was accompanied by Gabil&#39;s group, and Carrera and Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Gabil&rsquo;s cheerleaders</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt66" id="ftnt_ref66">[66]</a></sup><span class="c0">, Kakushin, Sukerou, and Yashichi, and Gazat-kun, the captain of the &lsquo;Hiryuu,&rsquo; were also there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know who Gabil&#39;s second-in-command is, but I am sure that these four stand out.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though the &ldquo;Hiryuu&rdquo; and others were preparing to face a decisive battle with a dangerous opponent, they all looked very happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason seemed to be because Ultima&rsquo;s special training had been put on hold for the time being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was so harsh that they all died many times. They had all lamented over being unable to stop even after death, because they were still in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you think about it, that labyrinth is a foul.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather than training to the point of death, you can assess your limits on the assumption that you will die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, thanks to that, they seem to be improving rapidly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Simply evolving and increasing your magicule quantity does not mean that you will become truly strong. It is only when one has mastered their power that they can be called a first-class warrior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That said, you should not overdo it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wouldn&rsquo;t want to train like that either, so I decided I would tell Ultima to keep it in moderation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, there were a little over a hundred people in total. We had been waiting here for about ten minutes now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I told Milim that I would be here today through the &#39;Telepathy Net&#39;, but maybe she forgot?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they late?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There, there, Carrera-dono. We&rsquo;ve only just arrived, haven&#39;t we? Let&rsquo;s wait for the pick-up with the feeling of sightseeing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gabil-dono is kind, isn&#39;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think Carrera-sama is just too quick-tempered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you say, Esprit?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s barely enough. But still enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can help but understand Carrera&rsquo;s frustration. But that&#39;s because I still have the senses of a modern Japanese who used to live by the minute, and in this world, I&#39;m one of the impatient ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We have a concept of time, and we have clocks, but they are not as elaborate as the wristwatches worn in my previous life. It is common knowledge in this world that only aristocrats or big merchants have pocket watches which are a little bulky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, if the time of an appointment is vague, such as in the afternoon, the general practice is to have a messenger on standby as early as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this case, it was Milim&#39;s fault for failing to do so, but it would not be mature to get angry because there was always the chance of a misunderstanding such as with the meeting time or date.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was no use asking Carrera for help, so I decided to take the lead here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t panic. I&#39;ll just check with Milim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After saying that, I tried &#39;telepathy net&#39; on Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey, Milim? I&#39;m already here, but is there no one at the meeting place?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Mmm!? R-Rimuru? I&#39;m busy with my homework, but I told Midley properly! Perhaps he misunderstood the time. I&#39;ll give him a strong reminder, so please don&#39;t be angry with him!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You get the idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I guess she was so busy with the homework Frey-san gave her that she forgot to give him my message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I understand, no need to panic.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Mm, mm! I&#39;ll see you later!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These things happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, I diligently waited for the pick-up while calming down Carrera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, something unexpected happened next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the people who rushed over made an outrageous remark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, you must be the Demon Lord Rimuru-sama! You are even more dignified than I had heard, and with such an impressive presence. I, Jagi, am truly impressed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The speaker, Jagi, bowed reverently towards Gabil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Apparently, Jagi&#39;s race is like a dragonewt. Unlike Gabil, Jagi has a human form, with horns growing out of the side of his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He is small in stature but has a sturdy physique and sharp movements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The five majins with him did not seem to have any noteworthy characteristics other than being diverse in race.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For some reason, Jagi had scars all over his body that appeared to be freshly made. That worried me a little, but he looked fine and healthy, so I guess it wasn&#39;t a problem. What was more troubling was Jagi&#39;s comment itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was stunned, but I think Gabil was the one who reacted with the most surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, I&#39;m not Rim&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, my goodness! You don&#39;t need to greet a low-ranking captain like me! There is not a single person under Demon Lord Milim-sama&#39;s command who does not know your name!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He hurriedly tried to deny it but was interrupted by that misunderstanding bastard&#39;s outburst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if you know my name, what&#39;s the point if you don&#39;t know my face?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were many majins who knew my face, but it seems that this low-ranking captain was not one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for the reason why Jagi mistook Gabil for me, I think it was the haki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had completely suppressed my youki and outwardly appeared as a normal human being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The same was true of Carrera and Esprit, who didn&rsquo;t look like demons or even majins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, because there were many human guests in Tempest, we had a habit of keeping our youki at bay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, things can&rsquo;t go on like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve been treated like this, and I was enjoying it, but Carrera and Esprit have very little patience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, that person is Gabi&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s with you people? Aren&rsquo;t you guys supposed to be maidservants? You may be wearing a military uniform, but if you&#39;re interrupting an adult conversation, you&#39;re not getting the education you need.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And now again, he interrupted Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To be honest, I thought he was the one who lacked education.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahaha, he&#39;s a pretty funny guy, isn&#39;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Carrera was laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Despite her words, I could see the veins bulging on her temples</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt67" id="ftnt_ref67">[67]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She seemed to be trying her best to hold back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It looks like she&#39;s three seconds away from exploding, so now is not the time to be laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just as I was thinking that, Esprit moved before me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, can you please just listen to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She said so firmly and put her hands on Jagi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not so much of a punch as it was a strong action. A weaker majin would have been unable to react and probably would have been knocked unconscious by the blow to the cheek.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Normally, I should be angry with Esprit, but this time it was Jagi&#39;s fault. He mistook Gabil for me and did not listen to us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although it was not good to resort to violence, Carrera had been about to lash out. Esprit&#39;s action was based on her understanding of the situation, so I decided to ignore it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought that if Jagi would calm down and listen to us, it would end the conversation there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, something unexpected happened next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jagi reacted to Esprit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hyah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The attack was instantaneous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jagi grabbed Esprit&#39;s left back fist with his right hand and twisted it lightly. As if to catch Esprit off guard, he used his right foot to sweep her off her feet while she was off balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Esprit leaped as if to avoid the low-kick-like sweep, or perhaps it was because she had read the attack. Then, twisting her body in midair, she threw a kick with her right foot towards Jagi&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jagi dodged the kick by bending his upper body, but that was not the end of Esprit&#39;s attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using her grabbed fist as an axis, Esprit kicked with her left leg, returning the kicked right leg like a pendulum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this way, she aimed at Jagi&#39;s neck so that her right and left legs intersected. It was an acrobatic technique, like something you might have seen in a comic book, but it would be difficult to deal with at first glance..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet, Jagi evaded the barrage by releasing Esprit&#39;s fist and doing a backflip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the two sides went back at it once more, but at this rate, both sides were going to end up getting serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, you seem to be quite the pleasant young lady. The fact that you&#39;re taking it easy on me, it&#39;s no wonder you&#39;re wearing a military uniform.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jagi snapped his neck as he began speaking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re good too, old man. I think I&#39;m going to enjoy this a little bit, so let&#39;s show them how serious we are, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In response, Esprit began smiling very nicely as she cracked her knuckles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Carrera was unperturbed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was obvious from her happy smile that she had no intention of stopping them as Esprit&rsquo;s boss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabil was very unreliable at times like these. Because of Ultima, he seemed to have been traumatized by the three demon girls. This time it was Esprit, but he didn&rsquo;t seem sure if he should talk to me or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabil glanced at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aw geez, it seems that I&rsquo;m the only one here with any common sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had no choice but to intervene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">First, I decided to call out the person in charge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&#39;s enough. Jagi-san, right? You won&rsquo;t talk to me, so go get your boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I stepped forward and called out to him in a grandiose manner. I think I was pretty cool, but I&#39;d give myself an eighty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I waited for Jagi&#39;s reply, feeling proud of myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah? Don&#39;t interfere in a man&#39;s fight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Something like that!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was instantly offended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But at the next moment&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You, you&#39;re being disrespectful to Rimuru-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Carrera kicked him with lightning speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even I have reached my end of my patience!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabil&#39;s spear struck down the Jagi who had been blown away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I was late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no turn left for Esprit, who had been facing him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And as for me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, you guys. Nothing happened here. Okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I lightly intimidating the majins that Jagi had brought with him in an attempt to destroy the evidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As it turned out, there was no need to threaten Jagi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fault turned out to be on Milim&#39;s side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahahahaha! Now you realize that it&#39;s not my fault, don&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I had thought you forgot to tell them, but I didn&#39;t realize that you were having fun playing a winner-takes-all game to see who would pick us up&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The winner was Jagi, but the war criminal was Midley.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How can that be? I don&#39;t understand&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, my guys are bloodthirsty, but Midley&#39;s guys are no slouches either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san was holding her head in her hands in disgust, and Karion was laughing with his stomach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, was this Jagi guy any good?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, he was strong. I&#39;d say he was about 50/50 with Phobio-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I replied to Karion, who suddenly asked me with a serious face, with my honest impression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, he was slightly inferior when comparing on the amount of magicules, but his skill (level) against Esprit was quite good. He might also have shape-shifting ability like Gabil, in which case my evaluation would be even higher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Phobio can also transform himself into a beast, so the gap between the two would never narrow, and I&#39;m sure Phobio would win in a real fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, Jagi is quite skilled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Like Midley, the priests of the Worshipers of Dragons are really strong. Because they do not rely on power alone, they are versatile and are able to use that to their advantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, they are muscle heads.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s quite an unfortunate reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m apologize for the state of affairs. I have failed in my supervision.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that said, Midley bowed his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I can imagine that Jagi was also inspired by this man, so I couldn&rsquo;t deny that Midley was largely responsible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you&#39;re Carrera-dono, right? Gabil-dono and I would appreciate your cooperation with our country for the time being.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In times like these, it was up to Frey-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion was a great king, but he also loved to fight. He was more like Midley and had not yet abandoned his innate values that the weak were bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time&mdash;or rather, we are saved in many respects because we were the strong ones. If we had been weaker, we would not have been able to negotiate as well as we did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that respect, I was pretty lucky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, Carrera-san. Why don&#39;t you have a little test of strength with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You see, Karion&#39;s got something to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hoh, that&rsquo;s quite the spirit you&rsquo;ve got there! Just tell me how much you want me to go easy on you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t just join in so easily, Carrera!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whoa, hey now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, milord. I hear Karion-dono has evolved. So then, it&#39;s only natural that he&rsquo;d want to know how much stronger he&rsquo;s become.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that may be true, but this isn&#39;t the labyrinth, you know? If you overdo it, you could die, so you guys have to refrain from such dangerous behavior.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabil and Frey-san were the only ones who nodded at my words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, the others looked dissatisfied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Especially Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ehh, that&rsquo;s boring!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san got angry at her. &lsquo;Don&#39;t say that!&rsquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But well, for practicality&rsquo;s sake, I couldn&rsquo;t allow it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They couldn&rsquo;t do it near the construction site, and would have to go to a place far enough away that wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by the battle. To do so right here would be like asking the enemy to aim right at us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, Karion was surprisingly insistent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure, I know it&#39;s dangerous. But I meant what I said when I said that. I want to know how strong I&#39;ve become before the showdown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion even asked Frey-san to agree with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Come to think of it, I had Ciel-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the time, it had just been &#39;Wisdom King (Raphael)&#39;, but it still answered all my questions, so I hadn&rsquo;t needed to test my strength to learn what I could do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the case of Karion and the others, the only way to find out was to test their strength by themselves. It made sense that the quickest way to find out was to fight the strongest person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&#39;t deny that. But isn&#39;t that a problem you&#39;ve always had and will always have to deal with on your own?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s true. But the enemy won&#39;t wait for us, you know? We have to get stronger quickly and protect the people who believe in us. To do that, we have to be willing to take some risks, don&#39;t you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san lost the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She seemed unable to say anything back once the duties of a king were brought up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he had only wanted to brag about his power, I would have dismissed it, but because he had a reason, it was a question I should consider.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru, I agree with Karion&#39;s opinion. I&rsquo;m training him now, but I think there are limits to what I can do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milim is right. It&#39;s a shame, but now that I&rsquo;ve awakened, I understand. I thought I had been getting stronger, but Milim still seemed so far away. And Rimuru, the difference between you and me is the same. There is a gap between you and me that cannot be bridged no matter how hard I try. On that note&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufu, do you think I can reach you? I&#39;ve been beaten, but I think you&#39;re right that it&#39;s better than dealing with Milim-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of a difference between me and Carrera in my current state&hellip;But if Karion feels that way, then it proves that his eyes are able to see the essence of things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy also thought highly of Karion, and if he could use the power he had awakened, he would be a great asset in the future war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was also a request from Milim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, the right thing to do would be to cooperate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All right. Then I&#39;ll return with Karion and Frey-san, and Carrera will stay here and defend as planned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh? I&rsquo;m the other one who&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There are suitable people in the labyrinth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I understand. As you wish, milord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I feel bad for being so gloomy, but I mustn&#39;t show my naivete here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Carrera was overkill. Ramiris&#39; complaints were giving me a headache, and it was wiser to have a more sensible partner if I wanted to leave Karion and the others in charge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion could have Benimaru. Or Zegion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Frey-san, Kumara would be a good choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d work out the details after I got back. If something happened, I could be contacted, and would immediately send them back via teleport.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve been a bit selfish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s okay. I&#39;m only cooperating with Karion because I think he&#39;s right. Is that okay with you, Frey-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, of course. It&#39;s very kind of you to offer, so I see no reason to refuse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so that&rsquo;s how it went.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabil and Carrera were left under Milim&#39;s command, and Karion and the others were brought back with me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Karion&#39;s subordinates were left to their own discretion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As long as they had not awakened, the environmental destruction wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad&hellip;I think. I had sent them a large supply of recovery medicine, so they should be able to handle the rest on their own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru and the others had gotten stronger that way, so they weren&rsquo;t worried about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After returning from Milim&#39;s country, Karion and the others were left in Benimaru&#39;s care and thrown into the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finally, it was time to go to Leon&#39;s country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had sent Diablo ahead of me, but I put off my visit until the end, so he was probably waiting for my arrival by now. With this in mind, I prepared for my departure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&rsquo;s country&mdash;I knew where El Dorado was because Mizari had guided me there before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, we would be there in a moment with Teleport.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will be your escort.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I felt safe with Souei.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t forget about me, my lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ranga poked his head out from behind me, appealing to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh good, good!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I nodded while enjoying the fluff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was always with me anyway, but he was cute like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And now&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was somewhat reluctant to go, but I had already informed the other party. It was always better to just get the unpleasant things done quickly, so I stood up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, let&#39;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Muttering to myself, I activated the teleport as Shuna and Rigurd saw us off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s territory was on a small continent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if it was small, a continent was still a continent. It was a little bigger than Australia. There was an astonishingly vast amount of flat land with well-organized streets and cityscape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Leon and the others had settled here, there had been a natural landscape of forests, plains, lakes, rivers, and mountains. It was said that the current state is the result of forcing that landscape into shape with great magic and optimizing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An artificial city created with the harmony of nature in mind&mdash;that was El Dorado, the city where Demon Lord Leon Cromwell resided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow, this is amazing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In response to my muttering, Silver Knight Alrose, who had met me at the designated spot, replied happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha, I am honored. I am sure Leon-sama will be pleased to hear that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I met him before, he had been wearing a helmet that completely hid his face, but now his face was bare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was not as beautiful as Leon, but he looked like a beautiful woman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His beautiful silver hair flowed down his back, but judging by the thickness of his neck and his Adam&rsquo;s apple, he was definitely a man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, it seemed that Alrose was also the leader of Leon&#39;s subordinates, the Magic Knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Another person I had met, Black Knight Claude-san, was said to be the strongest, but this Alrose was also quite good. He was able to use magic without chanting and was able to invoke transference spells quite naturally. We finally arrived outside of the city&mdash;that is, outside of the city&#39;s defenses, but from there we arrived in front of the Great Gate</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt68" id="ftnt_ref68">[68]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The race didn&#39;t seem to be human, but they looked human. When I thought as much, I was told that they were demonoids.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were a long-lived and magically gifted race, but it seems that they used to be human. They were born by a mutation called majinization, so their population was quite small.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Perhaps, Myuran or Larzen&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;Yes, by definition, they are the same&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I knew I was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, the term &ldquo;majin&rdquo; was so diverse that it was troublesome to define them in detail. If a former human was transformed into a majin, there seemed to be no problem to call them a demonoid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, I turned my attention to the city beyond the Great Gate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was even greater than I expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The beautiful golden buildings all lined up in a row were truly magnificent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The arrangement of the buildings had been well calculated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a nutshell, the shape of the buildings could be described as a six-pointed star, or a hexagonal ridge. This alone created a two-dimensional magical effect, but the amazing part began from here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cityscape was spiraling, gradually increasing in height from the entrance. It lead to a chalk-white castle that stood majestically in the center.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A spiraling royal castle rising up as if piercing the heavens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The size of the castle itself was not that large, but the three-dimensional structure of the entire city made it look quite enormous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you glanced at it from above, you would see that the city itself formed a powerful stacked magic circle. Conversely, those who did not have a bird&#39;s-eye view from above would not be able to notice the magic circle drawn by the city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And even if you had a bird&#39;s eye view, you would not notice it unless you were conscious of it. It was such a clever and exquisite arrangement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I, too, had dreamed up many romantic ideas for the construction of cities, but I had never thought of incorporating magic circles. It had been a long time since I&rsquo;d had a great idea, and it made me feel a bit frustrated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This well-calculated city structure stimulated my pride as a former construction worker.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our country was undoubtedly wonderful, but we could not afford to plan our cities with such a high priority on functionality. We had Ramiris&rsquo; Labyrinth to protect us, but that was really just a result of luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had wanted to devise a system to maintain it with the magical power of the city&#39;s inhabitants, and achieved it in that way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This city itself has the effect of a powerful magic circle. I can only say it&#39;s amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I felt a little defeated, so I praised it honestly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, you can tell?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose smiled happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Its effects are &lsquo;Search Enemy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Countermagic,&rsquo; right? It&#39;s too different in scale from normal magic to have the usual effect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just to give two effects to a single magic circle, you&#39;d have to go to a lot of trouble to come up with the right arrangement. This was made possible by the scale of a city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While drawing a magic circle with only the arrangement of the buildings, he was able to deploy tactical grade magic at all times, so the magnitude of his feat was immeasurable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If someone entered the city without permission, they would be detected immediately. In addition, any magic attack from outside the city would be repelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a magic circle of this scale, even legion magic, which specialized in attacking cities, would be easily repelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha, you&#39;re good. You can understand that much just from a glance? There&#39;s no point in hiding it, so I&#39;ll tell you, you&#39;re right. This city has been given an Absolute Defense by magic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose replied proudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that time, he smoothly explained to me that &ldquo;this ward protects us from evil demons that shoot nuclear magic,&rdquo; but I didn&#39;t listen to him, because it seemed inconvenient for me if I pursued it too deeply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had a glimpse of a blonde schoolgirl-like demon flash through my mind, but I think it must have been my imagination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I decided to arm myself with the theory by assuming as such, and praised Alrose so that it would not be pursued further.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It would have taken an enormous amount of money and years just to achieve just one effect, wouldn&#39;t it? But two of them, while accounting for the expansion of the city&#39;s functions as they develop, were achieved so perfectly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. It was a tremendously difficult journey, but we believed in Leon-sama and we did it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&#39;s seriously amazing. You took something that would have been profitable if it had worked, and you succeeded.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, thank you. I didn&#39;t expect all of this praise. Leon-sama is the one who invented this city, so I&#39;m sure he&rsquo;ll be very pleased.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No way, Leon designed this city!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t know he was a real genius&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought he was just a &ldquo;Chloe-loving, sulky demon lord&rdquo;, but I guess I needed to change my perception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This cityscape was definitely beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because it was a reality that I had no choice but to admit, my excitement outweighed my frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Souei was also observing the city with admiration, but magic wasn&rsquo;t his specialty. Even so, he seemed to be listening greedily to see if there was anything to be gained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it difficult to invade from the sky? In that case, we&rsquo;d have to go underground&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was just thinking of a way to attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, but that&rsquo;s important too, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We may have a cooperative relationship right now, but we also might end up working against one another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In any case, the combination of the city and the magic circle was wonderful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wanted to introduce this feature to our country, but it&rsquo;s not something that can be easily imitated. At least, the capital city Rimuru was complete in another sense, so it was impossible to introduce it right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was a future project.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If there was ever a chance to add another city, I would try to realize my idea then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now I had something to look forward to when I got home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It may be a waste of time, but I decided that I&#39;d try designing my own magical city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I walked through the entrance of the Great Gate and followed the glass spiral corridor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The interior of the city was also beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the distance, waterfalls were flowing down with great force from the man-made cliffs. The water flowed through the city&#39;s canals, creating beautiful patterns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We walked for about ten minutes, enjoying the city in this way. Finally, we arrived at an area guarded by the knights from the general public.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the back of this area, there is a magic circle that leads to the front of the royal palace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose said as such while guiding us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To our surprise, the person who greeted us at the magic circle was the lord of this land himself, Demon Lord Leon Cromwell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was surprised to see that he was dressed in a white shirt and jeans, which was rougher than I expected, but it looked very good on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A lady killer looks good no matter what he wears, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leaning against a pillar with his arms crossed, he looked as if he were a painting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A picture containing text

He was still sarcastic and handsome, but he seemed to be lacking in aura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course not. More importantly, you&rsquo;re looking little haggard, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;You&#39;re annoying. You&#39;re the one who sent us the culprit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ah!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s all I needed to know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&#39;s probably causing trouble, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Could it be, that Diablo is&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a moment, a silent stare-down ensued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon looked like he had something to say, but he swallowed his words and just nodded once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Heavy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The air was incredibly heavy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was led through the castle in silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finally we arrived at a gorgeous and luxurious room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The room was decorated with gold, silver and jewels, but the furnishings were elegant and not obnoxious. The wallpaper was unified in a pure white, and the jewels reflected the glow of the chandeliers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Like Clayman&#39;s castle, it was not in bad taste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather, it was a shining example of good taste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I guess you could say that it was luxurious enough not to be suffocating. Just as the exterior of the castle was chalk-white but not gaudy, the interior was beautiful, elegant and calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even a commoner like me could relax in this place without feeling nervous. The atmosphere was heavy, but the furnishings were very comforting to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;Or so I thought, but then the hallway became noisy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though I didn&#39;t feel nervous, I had a feeling that I&rsquo;d be getting a headache.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Naturally, I was exactly right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Rimuru-sama! I&#39;ve been expecting you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After bowing to me reverently, he led me to the reception room quite naturally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is Leon&#39;s country, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was tempted to ask him why he looked like he owned the place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy came in after Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;ve kept me waiting long enough, Rimuru. Why did you make this place the last one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While saying that, he sat down on the chair facing me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s because Guy-san was here. It&#39;s such a relief to have someone strong around, so I wonder if I even had to come here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I joked lightly, trying to convey my true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy&#39;s temples twitched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m a man who can read the atmosphere, so I decided to change the subject before Guy exploded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Relax. The fact is, with you and Diablo here, you could have dealt with the enemy if they had attacked, right? I was a little worried about Ruminas, and as for Dagruel, I don&#39;t even know how strong he is. It&#39;s only natural that I should prioritize.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milim is just as strong as me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, Milim is also strong. I knew exactly what Guy meant, but there was a good reason for this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milim&#39;s territory is undertaking construction work. For me, who&rsquo;s creed is credit first, I had no choice but to give them priority.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, I put on a smug face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milim is, after all, a very important friend of mine, and she&#39;s helped me a lot. It was only natural that I should repay her, and there was no need to even ask who was more important between her and Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She might&rsquo;ve gotten into some trouble, but it was mutual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tsk, well whatever. So, how are the other demon lords doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The good thing about Guy is that he can quickly switch gears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was relieved to see that even though he was annoyed about being put off, he still kept a clear head and a sound judgement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For the time being, I&#39;ve installed &ldquo;magic transfer circles&rdquo; in each country. The fine adjustments are still being worked out, but there should be no problem activating them in case of an emergency.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While saying this, I opened the &#39;Stomach&#39; a little to reveal a magisteel disk. It was so big that it was a pain to take out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll install it if you specify the location.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I&#39;ll show you that later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon interjected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No wait, Leon is the master of this castle, so that was a good thing. Guy&#39;s attitude was so pompous that I almost misunderstood him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ve prepared for emergencies in time. So now we just have to wait for the enemy to attack?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yeah. As for me, I&#39;ll be cleaning up after the war with the Empire and strengthening ties with the Western Nations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&#39;t expect humans to be a force to be reckoned with, can you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. So, they&rsquo;ll be doing evacuation drills.

He looked at him as if he were a Predator stalking its prey. This guy might really be serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t tell who would win, and I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t care.

It seemed to have happened yesterday, so I was just glad it wasn&#39;t today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I looked over at Leon, he was sighing very unhappily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It all started when that maid picked a fight with Diablo. She was beaten to a pulp and fled, cursing her defeat&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s gaze caught Rain&#39;s as if to say, &ldquo;That&#39;s the maid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.

As for me, I dislike bullying the weak. I let her off the hook.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah? Didn&#39;t I tell you I&rsquo;d get serious next time? Did you misunderstand me because I took it easy on you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you forget that you brought Mizari to challenge me in a two-on-one match? Next time, I&#39;ll have to discipline you harder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Diablo remained calm, Rain taunted her opponent as if to encourage the other. I was worried that they were going to use force, but strangely enough, they didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What a pain in the ass these two are&hellip;they came to an agreement before we knew it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy said so incredulously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that the quarreling was a regular occurrence, and was quite cute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been fighting every day for the last two weeks. Before we knew it, they were on the same page.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s affirmation lent credence to Guy&#39;s story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And if that was true, then it could be understood that the imbalance of forces had become quite troublesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way. What proof do you have for that kind of crap?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you really think we wouldn&#39;t find out? In yesterday&#39;s fight, you were shouting out stuff like, &lsquo;Fuck you!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Show some more fighting spirit, Diablo!!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain tilted her head and asked curiously, but Leon replied without changing his expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then Guy&#39;s voice overlapped, sounding disgusted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rain, you&#39;re revealing your true colors. I mean, you were rooting for Diablo instead of me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way. I would never use such vulgar language, and I am Guy-sama&#39;s loyal follower. Leon-sama must be mistaken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She said that without hesitation, this person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it while she was looking serious, but she must be the youngest, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She&#39;s the type who doesn&#39;t think twice about what she says or does and believes she can do whatever she wants. People who were loved by their older brothers and sisters tended to be like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it was obvious which side was right after listening to all this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Diablo, how did you guys get like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo would never lie to me, so I put the question to him directly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo smiled and answered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is all thanks to the majesty of Rimuru-sama.

Isn&#39;t it possible that I&#39;ve always been treated like an idiot because of Rain&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, it looks like you&rsquo;ve realized the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t want to say it out loud, but I think that was the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But since it was not good to interfere with other people&#39;s affairs, I pretended not to have heard her murmurings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After chatting for a while, I was led to a hidden room behind the audience chamber where the throne was located, where I set up a &ldquo;magic transfer circle.&rdquo; It weighed several tens of tons, so it would be troublesome to move it once it was installed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, having finished my business, I quickly took my leave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon seemed to have wanted me to take Diablo and Rain, but that would interfere with the mission. Even if it didn&#39;t, I had no intention of taking them with me, so I decided just have Leon put up with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then we began our farewells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take care of Chloe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon reminded me.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t need to be told, so I nodded and said, &ldquo;I&#39;ll take care of her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon seemed to be convinced and gave up surprisingly well. It&#39;s a secret that I was a little surprised, because I had thought he would be more persistent in getting involved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was a pretty cool guy when he was behaving normally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not only that, but a surprising truth came to light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, Leon and I had the same taste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t mean that we&#39;re lolicons, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather, Leon&#39;s dream was to be an architect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No wonder he has a great aesthetic sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I heard this during our chat while complimenting the city and the castle. I was convinced, because I had already admitted that Leon&#39;s sense of style was one of the best in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&#39;s rude, but is actually a good guy. That was my new opinion of Demon Lord Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that feeling in mind, my relationship with Leon was improved, and my visit to El Dorado ended successfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After returning from Leon&#39;s country, I continued to vigorously travel around the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The purpose of this was to strengthen the cooperation with other countries, as we did not know when the enemy would attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because I had prepared an emergency means of transportation between demon lords, it was only natural that I should set up such means in other friendly countries as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first place I went to was the Dwarven Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Currently, Agera was dispatched to Gazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had received a report that she was training with Gazel, so I thought I would check the results of her training.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I teleported to the main gate of Dwargon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As always, there was a long line of merchants and adventurers. I walked past them to the nobleman&#39;s passage and called out to the gatekeeper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, I was ushered into the royal castle without any waiting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am still a small-time citizen, so I feel superior in such a situation. I was aware of my small stature, so I was careful not to make a big show of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was greeted by Gazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve been waiting for you, Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, Agera was with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lord, I am glad to see you are well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He kneels down grandly and says a few words of greeting to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was like something out of a period drama, but very well done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And this Agera, surprisingly, is the reincarnated form of Hakurou&#39;s grandfather. I was surprised when Carrera told me about it, but as I observed him more carefully, I found that his mannerisms were very similar to mine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I remembered that I had wanted to have an interview with him, but had not had a chance to do so. It would be a good idea to talk to him after this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, I returned the greeting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Long time no see, King Gazel. It&#39;s good to see you. And Agera, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha! You&rsquo;re still so formal. As I always say, feel free to call me Gazel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&#39;m trying to, but I get so nervous when I see you in these situations. It reminds me of the trial, and I&#39;m still a small-time citizen after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t get rid of my small-town feeling, but I think I&#39;m cute like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, it would be strange not to get nervous in front of such a big person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pann-san and Dorf-san were watching our conversation with a warm feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So did Souei.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Agera interjected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;From my point of view, I should do as my lord wills, but Carrera-sama would scold me if I said that. In the first place, as the ally of the Alliance, you are on equal footing. You should not be shy about being in front of King Gazel, and I hope you will respond with dignity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess I know what I&#39;m doing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Needless to say, I understood, but I had been an office worker up until a few years ago. Unless I was angry, or focused, or caught up in some big event that I couldn&rsquo;t afford to be in, I would &nbsp;revert to my normal self.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good, I can understand Rimuru&#39;s feelings. Even I get nervous when I&#39;m in front of the Celestial Emperor Elmesia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, so King Gazel had such a person&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;However! You are able to talk to the Emperor with ease, even though I am not very good at it! That&#39;s what I can&rsquo;t figure it out!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was so right that I couldn&rsquo;t argue about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Gazel told me to be less formal with him, and I said I would do my best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But, well, I respect him because he&#39;s someone I can rely on somehow. It&#39;s difficult to fix this behavior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But in some cases, you give right response at the right time, so it&#39;s not that much of a problem, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You idiot. It is in such situations that one&rsquo;s usual habits come out. To avoid failing on the big stage, one should always reexamine their own behavior.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was taught another lesson.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because I was often lectured like this, I tended to revert to my old behavior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">El-tan</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt73" id="ftnt_ref73">[73]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;also gives me a lecture sometimes, but she&rsquo;s always on and off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that sense, she might just be trying to make it easier for me and Myourmiles-kun to get along with her&mdash;though I could also me overthinking it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In any case, I kept Gazel&#39;s suggestion in mind for future reference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We moved to the parlor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With drinks in hand, we reported on our recent activities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The most important purpose of the meeting was to exchange information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So how do we avoid the war&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it can be avoided. I&rsquo;ve just set up &lsquo;magic transfer circles&rsquo; between the demon lords to allow for emergency travel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;One problem goes, and another one follows. To be honest, I thought it was over when Velgrynd-sama became an enemy. Now that she&rsquo;s on our side&hellip; Michael, was &nbsp;it? I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the one we should be worried about now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I wasn&rsquo;t looking to praise myself, but our forces surpass those of the Empire in its prime. In addition to that, we have demon lords, Velgrynd, and even Veldora, so Gazel seems to think that we have no reason to lose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, that is a naive perception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, they are strong opponents. Even judging by power alone, its scale is incomparable to the Empire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I understand. I&#39;m not underestimating them, quite the opposite actually.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The opposite?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to help you no matter how hard I try, so I&#39;ve come to the point of resignation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, that&#39;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, yeah, that&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No matter how powerful Dwargon was, victory would be impossible if Velzard targeted them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can understand why he might want to give up because the individual enemy is too strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;However, I won&#39;t let them destroy us easily. Worst case scenario, we&#39;ll be ready to take our chances.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gazel barked out, full of spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His resolve was unquestionably genuine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that he did not run away from Velgrynd made it clear that he was someone who would take on a battle he knew he would lose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While thinking of Gazel in a reassuring way, I continued my story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you can&#39;t win, you should think of a way to win, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Quality was more dangerous than quantity. What&#39;s worse was the fact that Velzard was hostile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This made Veldora useless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only people who can take on Velzard properly are Guy and Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;d rather not, so I&#39;m determined to escape at all costs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A war between true dragons is like a battle of the gods.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;True. That&#39;s what it feels like. But I can&#39;t just run away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you really think you can win?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No! But I&#39;m willing to work hard to improve my odds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufufu, you little bastard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gazel nodded at me with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The truth is that I really didn&rsquo;t know what I was going to until I tried, but I&rsquo;ll just make sure I can escape if I don&#39;t think I can win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve tried to make myself look good, but there is no point in arguing about whether we can win or not before we have even analyzed the enemy&#39;s strength. The point is that I&#39;m just trying to be prepared for what to do if we&#39;re about to lose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, I need your help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well. I&#39;ll lend you my cooperation, and you can do whatever you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gazel readily agreed to my request for help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I immediately requested the installation of a &lsquo;magic transfer circle.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unlike the previous installations for personal use, the location of this one was also important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m amazed that you were able to create such a high purity magisteel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m cheating on that by using my Skill. Normally, I&#39;d wait for the crafters to mature, but the enemy won&#39;t wait for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Well, I guess. You can leave the adjustments to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thanked Gazel and set up the magic circle for the transfer at the place he had instructed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having successfully accomplished my goal, I moved on to chatting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, how are the results of your training?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. You are the grandfather of Master Hakurou and the founder of Oboro-Ryu, Agera-dono. You&#39;ve made me realize that I still have a long ways to go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Don&#39;t be modest, King Gazel. You have already mastered the secret art of the &lsquo;Five Flower Strikes (Gokatotsu)&rsquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt74" id="ftnt_ref74">[74]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and are aiming for even greater heights.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the Oboro-Ryu, it is said that the Five Flowers Strikes (Gokatotsu) and above are considered secret techniques.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zakuro (Pomegranate) &ndash; or the &lsquo;Rokkazan&rsquo; is a high-speed slashing blow intended to be non-lethal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yanagi (Willow) &ndash; or the &lsquo;Nana Nagi&rsquo; is a sword technique that softly parries the enemy&#39;s attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The number of moves increases with slashes and stabs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">And then finally, the highest technique is said to be attained, the Yaezakura (Cherry Blossom</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt75" id="ftnt_ref75">[75]</a></sup><span class="c0">) &ndash; or the &lsquo;Hakkasen.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is said that this is a sword art that should be kept secret from the public, but Agera intended to pass it on to Gazel without reserve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I heard from Hakurou that his grandfather showed him the &lsquo;Hakkasen?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. It was before I was reincarnated, so I&#39;m not sure my memory is correct, but I seem to remember showing it to him once or twice. If he was able to reproduce it, then he is undoubtedly a genius. I am ashamed to say that I am boasting about my grandson, but I am not Byakuya Araki, his grandfather. I would like to honestly praise the predecessors of the monster country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Agera said so, shyly and proudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, Hakurou is my master as well. I don&#39;t feel bad about the praise, I feel happy about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The teachings of Agera-dono have been passed on to Hakurou-dono. When you think about it, fate really is a mysterious thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gazel agrees with my words and smiles happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Agera watched us and nodded, deeply moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Rimuru. If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m able to understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&#39;ve mentioned this before, but I&#39;d like to ask you about the Ultimate Skill. If I continue to hone my sword skills, do you think I can defeat an Ultimate Awakened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, that&#39;s quite the direct question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Depending on the situation, it wouldn&rsquo;t be impossible to win. It would be a very tough fight, but not impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The lesson I have learned is that Ultimate Skills can only be countered by Ultimate Skills. It&#39;s better to think that you can&#39;t compete at the unique skill level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, is there&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;However, if certain conditions are met, I think it should be possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, what are those conditions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For example, Yuuki Kagurazaka&#39;s &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; was a nasty super-specializing ability that blocked my powers. Also, Diablo overwhelmed and ultimate gift owner with his magic alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a possibility, but I think that the key is willpower. If a mental life form exists only by will power, it seems to be able to resist the ultimate power even without an Ultimate Skill. I think this guess is correct with a high degree of certainty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want to be definitive, but I thought it was almost certain because it actually was in agreement with Ciel-san&#39;s view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, the key is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a matter of whether I can increase my willpower to the point where it rivals that of a spiritual life form? Then, after the way of the sword&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There may be a quicker way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It seems that if you are recognized by mythical-grade armor, you can become the equivalent of a spiritual life form.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, there was also the foul technique of granting power, but as they, &lsquo;too much power can destroy you.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or was it &ldquo;greed&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;power&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It may have been changed from the original parable, but I think it still conveys my point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t master the power if you don&rsquo;t have the strength to handle it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I don&#39;t grant skills to all of my subordinates. Also, there was no way that I was going to do that to Gazel. He&rsquo;d have to do his best on his own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, I can&#39;t grant skills unto to someone who is not connected to my soul. I awakened Rain and Mizari, but that&#39;s not the same thing as this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So this time, I think getting mythical-grade is probably the best solution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That said, mythical-grade equipment is not so easy to obtain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have also been trying to analyze Hinata&#39;s &ldquo;holy spirit armament&rdquo; and mass produce it, but no matter how hard I try, I can&#39;t seem to get it to reach t he legendary-grade. If I put it on, I might be able to reach the power of Saint, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to compete with an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Mythical-grade, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gazel muttered and looked at his own sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The well-used sword was probably of Legendary-grade. It also seemed to be a fairly high-ranking sword. However, there were countless scars on the blade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This was the result of clashing with Kondou&#39;s sword. It was fortuitous that it didn&#39;t break, but this sword&#39;s life is over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It must have been a national treasure passed down from generation to generation. And yet, now that it was like this, it could only be kept on display.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, but perhaps&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shall I ask Kurobee? Maybe he can bring the sword back to life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Is that true!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t promise anything, but Kurobee has a proven track record of renewing Gabil&#39;s spear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kurobee had repaired Gabil&#39;s Vortex Spear using the hihiirokane I provided, and it was reborn at a stage just short of mythical-grade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With continued use, it would eventually evolve into a mythical-grade model.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I still have a surplus of hihiirokane left over&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The sword doesn&#39;t seem to be dead, so maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please. I don&#39;t care if you fail, just ask Kurobee-dono!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a great service, but I&#39;ll spare no expense for my senior apprentice. He&#39;s always been such a great help to me, and this is the time I should return the favor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, I accepted the sword from Gazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aside from the sword though, is there any other way to get mythical-grade equipment?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think there is? Since you don&#39;t seem to know anything about common sense, let me tell you that even something legendary-grade is a national treasure. And it&#39;s from a major country. You wouldn&#39;t find them in an empire, let alone the middle of nowhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Please don&#39;t be so shocked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought that would be the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The result of my research is the same. I had us search all over the Western Nations&#39; back routes, but I&rsquo;ve only managed to find a few Legendary-grade items.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that Souei had confirmed Gazel&#39;s words, the remaining hope was left to Kurobee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Souei&#39;s twin swords were also renewed by Kurobee&#39;s hand. Unfortunately, it did not reach the mythical-grade, but with Souei&#39;s ability, that was not a big problem. On the contrary, he thinks positively that there is room for growth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&#39;s no point in asking for what you don&#39;t have. More importantly, do you think you can compete with an Ultimate Skill if you become a spiritual life form?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s not an absolute either. It&#39;s natural that there are differences between individuals depending on the number of years they&#39;ve lived, but a newborn archdemon still seems to be useless. If one has a strong will and the mental strength (energy) to support it, then they can resist the ultimate power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Meh, your explanation is too vague to understand&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, I don&#39;t think that&rsquo;s the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But if you&#39;re going to go that far, I&rsquo;ll make it simple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In short, it&#39;s about spirit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want to say this because it was more of a gut feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be a mistake to think that you can cover up anything with fighting spirit, but when it comes to an Ultimate Skill, other explanations were more difficult to explain than this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the most part, since we live in a world where a flash of a sword can split the atmosphere in a flash of light, there may not be much difference between swordplay and magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you train your will power, you can distort even the laws of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;It is easier to understand and everything will be all right if we assume that it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After listening to my explanation, Gazel became serious and fell silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I glanced at Agera, who was also looking thoughtful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, Souei opened his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is exactly as Rimuru-sama says. As a recipient of an Ultimate Gift myself, I cannot speak too much, but I do feel that if I put my spirit on my sword, I can kill any opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Agera nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is true. In my case, it was as if I sublimated all my will into a blade. With the will to kill the enemy itself, my own body becomes the blade, and I believe that nothing cannot be killed by my sword. Therefore, it can kill even formless things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right, Agera&#39;s skill was &#39;Blade Transformation&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we were to simply compare the existential value, Agera&#39;s transformed sword would not be better than the mythical-grade. However, Agera was superior in its sharpness. It is said that mythical-grade has a will, but it is still not as strong as human&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ranga popped his head out of my shadow and joined the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A black and white photo of a snowman

I was asleep in my lord&#39;s shadow when I suddenly felt as if I had heard a strange voice, and then it hit me: &lsquo;Stellar Wind King (Hastur).&rsquo; But I think it was because I kept wishing to be of service to my Lord that it took shape in this way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Hahahah,&rsquo; Ranga said happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Maybe he&#39;s gotten smarter lately, but his lower body was still in my shadow. So, I couldn&#39;t see it, but I guessed that his tail was wagging as hard as it could.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s really cute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I used to be a cat person, but recently I&#39;ve come to think that dogs are nice too. I think that Ranga was a significant contribution to this change of mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, I hope the stories from Souei, Agera, and Ranga will be helpful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Spirit, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, there&#39;s no need to be hasty. If the enemy attacks while I&#39;m here, then I&#39;ll help you. Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That would be certain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Between Gazel&#39;s power and Agera&#39;s swordsmanship, I think they would be a good match even if the opponent was Kondou. At the very least, it would buy some time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If your opponent is Velzard-san, you&#39;d better run away without hesitation. She&rsquo;s probably not the kind of opponent you can fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I can&#39;t say for sure because I haven&#39;t seen her in action, but she felt creepier than Velgrynd-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;I hate to admit it, but you&#39;re probably right. As for me, after seeing Velgrynd, I understand how reckless it is to challenge a True Dragon. But as a king, I can&#39;t abandon my people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then we can only pray that Velzard does not attack. If she does, let me know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I said so and indicated to my mobile phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm, you have it!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said before, it&#39;s a magical device that allows you to talk directly to someone. There aren&#39;t many of them made yet, so take good care of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That said, I only gave him my personal number and the direct line to the Control Room. I didn&#39;t give him El-tan&#39;s or Myourmiles-kun&#39;s numbers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think it is bad etiquette to not of ask such things directly from the people themselves. I remember being annoyed when my cell phone number was given to my business partners without my permission before I died.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, so if you type in the number you have on file, you&#39;ll be connected to the other party.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. Not many people have this, but if they do, ask them for the number.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mm. If you need help with something, you can ask me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to work. Call me if you need anything, and I&#39;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All right, I&#39;m counting on you. Of course, if there&#39;s anything I can do, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me. Personally, I&#39;ll do everything I can to help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gazel and I laugh at each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely that Dwargon will be targeted, but I&rsquo;m relieved. And thus ended the discussion on emergency response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After staying in the Dwarven Kingdom for a few days, the next stop was the Farmenas Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is where Gadra is staying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra, who had become Diablo&#39;s disciple, was also helping Testarossa. It seems that Gadra was forced to give up all of the information on the empire in order to secure Masayuki&#39;s accession to the throne.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He seemed to have been busy going back and forth between the two countries, but now he was settled in the Kingdom of Farmenas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought I&#39;d take this opportunity to ask him some questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The capital of the Farmenas Kingdom was livelier than I had imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The city had been under construction when I came here before, and it was the same now. The difference between now and then was that more areas had been cleaned up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the outskirts of the capital, a large station had been completed. In the vicinity of the station, there were warehouses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because it was a relay point between Blumund and Dwargon, it was necessary to have a place to store various goods. The station building was constructed adjacent to the capital since it was not possible to secure a place in the capital</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason why the construction of Royal Capital was postponed was that the priority was placed on economic activities for the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Another reason may be that the current Farmenas family had no money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To put it simply, I was lending them all the money for the construction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The contract for laying the rails for the magic train was managed by our country. At first glance, this may seem like a generous thing, but that is a shallow view. The fee for the use of the railroad would become our country&rsquo;s income, and we had placed the unbeatable condition that the expenses for the use of the land would be free forever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once the construction was finished, all we&rsquo;d have to do was sit and wait for the money to be collected. Even after deducting the labor cost, the maintenance cost of the train, the maintenance cost of the rails, etc., the annual profit was estimated to be quite large.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I was responsible for the &ldquo;magic train&rdquo; project, but Farmenas was responsible for the urban development of the surrounding area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myuran was mainly in charge of planning the development of the city, but she was forced to take a leave of absence due to childbirth. It was Youm, who became the king, who rose to the occasion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had said that he was uneducated, but he still had a good head on his shoulders. He took the initiative to study hard in order to replace Myuran, who had become immobile. As a result, even now that Myuran has recovered from childbirth, she is struggling to lead the nobles and officials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To support Youm, I gave him a low-interest, unsecured loan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why not interest-free, you say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the loan was interest-free, the borrower would inevitably feel indebted to the lender and become reserved. In addition, the lender might feel superior to the borrower, and the relationship may become one that cannot be called equal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lending and borrowing money between friends can be the biggest cause of losing friendship. That&#39;s why we made the contract between the two countries and concluded it in a firm form so that both parties would be satisfied and both parties would benefit from it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For this reason, the construction work was done in such a way as to prioritize economic activities, and the development o the &nbsp;city began &nbsp;to follow suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While we finished the reception at the gate and looked at the lively city, a horse-drawn carriage was expressly prepared for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Normally, we should have been accompanied by our own officials, like a procession of feudal lords. However, this was an emergency, and there was no time for an elegant trip by train, so I used Teleport to get here along with Souei and Ranga as my companions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason why I contacted Gadra and asked him to prepare a carriage was to keep a low profile in the Farmenas Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was relieved to know that he had sent a carriage to pick us up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unlike Milim&#39;s country, this one was very thorough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you for your patience. King Youm is waiting for you. I will take you to the castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or rather, it was Gadra who got out of the carriage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whoa, that surprised me. You didn&#39;t have to come all the way to the gate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s not possible. Such a prestigious role would not have been possible without such an opportunity. But more than that, if I did not greet Rimuru-sama, Diablo-sama would surely have me executed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra laughed, but it did not sound like a joke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If he&#39;s bullying you, why don&#39;t you tell me? For the time being, you&rsquo;re be under my direct control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">It was a little disconcerting calling an old man like Gadra &nbsp;&ldquo;you,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo; but I&#39;m afraid I was getting used to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I would like to advise Gadra, thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo may be quiet in front of me, but he tends to be reckless when I&#39;m not looking. If he does so in Leon&#39;s country, that&rsquo;s a laughing matter, but it becomes a big problem if he does so within Tempest&#39;s group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra is apparently Diablo&#39;s disciple, or rather, his faction, so he can&#39;t complain openly. That&#39;s why I, as his boss, should follow him from behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Gadra laughed and said it was no problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Apparently, no hardship is too great to gain knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s difficult to understand people with unique idiosyncrasies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was best not to interfere in such cases, and I vowed again to let Gadra do as he pleased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I boarded the carriage and received a report from Gadra about Masayuki&rsquo;s coronation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The carriage moves slowly through the city, so I make the most of the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Masayuki&#39;s coronation went well, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir. It went very well. With Testarossa-sama and Velgrynd-sama working together to encourage him, it would have been impossible for him to fail.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that would definitely be the case if those two are on our side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they weren&#39;t, that would be a problem, but I only got the impression that it would be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To begin with, Masayuki was a lucky man. On top of that, with such brilliant figures one his side like Testarossa and Velgrynd, the incarnation of power, I truly believed that no one would be able to oppose him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The people, who had seen Velgrynd-sama&#39;s majesty, seemed to welcome the crowning of the new Emperor Masayuki-sama. I mean, who could resist the sight of that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra assures us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, it&rsquo;s only natural that no one can complain when they are shown the overly grandiose match-pump that erupted a volcano to prevent its threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems to me that Velgrynd knows no bounds when it comes to treating volcanoes as matches.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Some people are still dissatisfied, but I&#39;m sure Testarossa-sama will take care of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it going to work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No problem. Calgurio-dono and others were worried that Testarossa-sama would kill all of the dissenters, but their fears were unfounded. It seems that the information I provided was put to good use, and I was impressed by Moss-sama&#39;s skill. I&#39;m sure he will be able to take advantage of the enemy&#39;s weakness and settle this matter in a perfect manner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, that&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make enemies with those two, either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If there&#39;s anyone brave enough to oppose us, we can recruit them in our country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I can only say </span><span class="c5">Yes</span><sup class="c9 c20"><a href="#ftnt77" id="ftnt_ref77">[77]</a></sup><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re absolutely right. I&#39;d feel the same way if I saw that scene.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra and I laugh at each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I thought, Gadra is a delightful old man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seemed that our hearts were connected because of our shared impression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Inside the castle, we were greeted by the king and queen, Youm and Myuran, as well as all of their ministers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Edmalis, the former King of Farmus, was also there, but he had lost weight and shaved his beard, so he looked different from when I met him. The light in his eyes was not cloudy, which made me think so even more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be awkward for both of us to talk to him, so I let him pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although this visit was unofficial, I informed them that the purpose of my visit was about the upcoming disaster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be great if we could avoid war, but everyone understood that it was too optimistic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Kingdom of Farmenas is a newborn nation and has no financial resources to spare. It relies on loans from our country, as I mentioned earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, their military power had not recovered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Training knights is not something that can be done overnight, not to mention that they have no money to hire mercenaries. I was not going to take the blame for that, even though I had something to do with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because if you care about everything, you can&rsquo;t have justice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t believe that everything I do is right, but from an official standpoint, I will shout for justice. If I don&#39;t, the victims won&#39;t be happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why even though I feel liable, I do not speak of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, as an ally, I will provide as much assistance as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sending Gadra is part of that, and Youm and the others understand as such. In other words, this country&#39;s vassals are facing the reality that they can&#39;t afford to get into a quarrel with me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Boss</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt78" id="ftnt_ref78">[78]</a></sup><span class="c0">, has the situation improved?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm asked on behalf of everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The demon lords and I have made a lot of arrangements, but to be honest, it&#39;s a bit of a crapshoot. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s enough, which is why I&rsquo;ve been traveling around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The situation had been explained via Gadra, so there was no major confusion. He also showed me where to install the &lsquo;magic transfer circle&rsquo; without me having to say a word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can ask Gadra here about the fine-tuning and how to use it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So this is your escape plan in case of emergency. But, you know, it&#39;s really a question of where you choose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yeah. The place where you escape might not always be safe, and it may only be a temporary relief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it doesn&#39;t matter where I run to if the boss&rsquo; country falls. In that case, I&#39;ll just resign myself to the fact that it was meant to be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm said so cheerfully, and his vassals nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that people in this country are more afraid of me than I thought. At the same time, there seemed to be a strange belief prevailing in the country that there was no point in doing anything if I could not win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, hey, don&#39;t be so irresponsible, just keep struggling until the end, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. My daughter was just born, so I&#39;m not going to end my life! But still, &ldquo;Papa&rdquo;&mdash;Why hasn&rsquo;t she called me that yet!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm had become a great parental fool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was poking at Meme, the baby in Myuran&#39;s arms, and grumbling like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I don&#39;t know about that, but&hellip;Too much attention will wake her up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myuran, who was taking care of Meme, would have been furious if that happened, so I casually warned him. This kind of casual consideration is the sign of a capable man. Maybe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please tell him more. He seems to lose his calm judgment when it comes to this child.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myuran said in a disgusted tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can imagine that&rsquo;s how he usually behaves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because there&#39;s a shitty wolf who claims my daughter is his daughter, so I can&#39;t be too careful!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what Youm says, but I don&#39;t understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What nonsense! I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s going to take your place and marry Myuran in the future. Then of course, Myuran&#39;s daughter will be my daughter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grucius, you bastard, give it a rest! How many times do I have to tell you that your assumptions are wrong!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hm, that&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm is crazy, but that shitty wolf&mdash;Grucius is crazy too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I know Meme is cute, but I don&#39;t know what kind of thinking he must have to claim her as his own daughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I can understand Youm&#39;s feelings&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right? Look, Grucius! I knew the boss would understand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No matter how busy he is, he worries that if he doesn&#39;t take care of Meme in his spare time, he won&#39;t be remembered as a father.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He said that he is making a tearful effort not to let Grucius beat him to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, in this day and age, it&#39;s not good idea to obsess over things. Even if it&#39;s a stupid story, if it makes you feel better, it&#39;s welcome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t say stupid things and get yourself flagged for death, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I said so and gave Youm and the others a list of death flags.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We held the meeting in the Farmus Kingdom&#39;s capitol building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since I had a general idea of the flow of the meeting, the explanation went smoothly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only thing I expected Youm and the others to do was to guide the people of Farmenas to evacuate, not to fight. Since the &lsquo;magic transfer circle&rsquo; I &nbsp;installed cannot evacuate a large number of people, we needed to decide who would use it beforehand. I asked them to coordinate it well so that there wouldn&rsquo;t be any conflicts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, the destination was not necessarily safe, so the purpose of the transfer was different. Rather than the evacuation of important people, we were more concerned with the dispatch of troops.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the Farmenas Kingdom became a battlefield, the newly established Knights would respond to the situation. It seems that Grucius has been training the knights from the new recruits, including the old Farmus knights, but they are not enough to fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, arrangements were made to send reinforcements from other countries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would have been easy if we had placed them from the beginning, but since we did not know where the enemy would aim, we needed to be able to move them in any way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After considering the importance, it was decided that the Farmenas Kingdom would be postponed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if this kingdom is lost, it can be rebuilt. As long as the human casualties were kept to a minimum, there was no need to force the war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was difficult for me to tell Youm and the others this, but I explained it to them and they agreed. Naturally, I promised to support them as much as possible by carrying out reconstruction projects in the worst case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This kind of &lsquo;laying the groundwork&rsquo; was important in order to make effective use of our limited forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know. It&#39;s not like boss has abandoned us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That said, there are only about fifty people who can go at a time with the &lsquo;magic transfer circle.&rsquo; It&#39;s not a reassuring number at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Still&hellip;Normally, we&#39;re supposed to protect our country on our own. And since you&#39;ve been so considerate, I don&#39;t want anything more!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His words weren&#39;t directed at me, but at the ministers who seemed to want to complain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can understand the unvoiced arguments of the ministers, that they wanted us to help, that they didn&rsquo;t want to sacrifice their people, and that they wanted us to send more forces, but unfortunately we can&#39;t afford it either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I guess they understood that, and that&#39;s why they grudgingly agreed with us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, the business with the Farmenas Kingdom was completed successfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">After that, </span><span class="c0">I went around to various places with Youm&#39;s guidance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The main attraction was the construction site where important facilities were being built.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Farmenas Kingdom was the original royal capital of Farmus, so the central part of the city, within the city walls, was a noble town. As you moved closer to the outer perimeter of the city, the population becomes poorer, and the free people were forced out of the city walls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Land readjustment was being carried out to make major renovations, but in the process, the streets running through the center of the city were dug up and underground passages were built.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The plan was to have the subway run from the station building adjacent to the royal capital.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s a bold move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Myuran is amazing. She used her magic to investigate the strength of the ground and came up with a plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Really, magic is such a cheat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Geological surveillance is very complicated, but it&#39;s so easy for a skilled wizard to find out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can easily find out the location of underground water veins, the existence of cavities, the brittleness of the ground, and the quality of the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, if you are good enough, you can even modify the soil. Soil-based magic can change the properties of soil, sand, soft rock, and hard rock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Long live magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No wonder science and technology have not developed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the contrary, the empires that focus on technology and the vampires who are treated as freaks are the ones that are unusual in this world. However, I think we should not make fun of them because they are the ones who make useful discoveries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s an idea I never had. I thought shield engineering was useless in this world, but I guess magic can help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I don&#39;t know what the shield thing is, but you&rsquo;re not losing, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s a technique for reinforcing an underground excavation so that the surface doesn&#39;t collapse. It takes a lot of machinery, but a good mage can do it, or maybe even beat it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I remembered mentioning once that it would be nice if we could run trains underground. I can only admire the fact that Myuran, who remembered it, has made it happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I heard that Larzen also cooperated, and it can be said that a construction method unique to another world has been completed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In terms of cost, this method is definitely much more advantageous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, this is not a matter of winning or losing. I felt that we could bring about a revolution by introducing the idea of technology into magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Well, now </span><span class="c11 c22">I&#39;m trying to suspend the construction and use the underpass as an evacuation site</span><span class="c0">. We&#39;ve reinforced the ceiling with magic, so it can withstand a big magic explosion in the city.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It depends on the scale of destruction, but I think it&#39;s a good bomb shelter. If you stock up on water and food, you can stay in there for quite a while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It seems that water can be managed by magic. That&#39;s why I&#39;m having them only carry food. I&#39;ve also dug a bunch of side holes for places to sleep and a big hole under the room with the door. You can use it as an outhouse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The room we were led to was indeed a toilet. The room was divided into many private rooms and could be used by about a hundred people at the same time. The shape of the toilet was Western style, and it was dropped down like a Botton</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt79" id="ftnt_ref79">[79]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;toilet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But won&#39;t the smell be bad in the underground space?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think so? But underneath this toilet, there are pieces of wood and other materials that help eliminate the smell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, maybe it&#39;s like a bio-toilet?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know much about them, but the activated microorganisms break down the solids into water and carbon dioxide, and the water evaporates, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;That&#39;s pretty much correct. I&#39;ve confirmed that the mechanism is working correctly, so there should be no problem with foul odor&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I heard that there are about five toilets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seemed that they could manage even if the siege lasted long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since there is a place to escape, we could send people who specialize in setting up &#39;defensive barriers.&rsquo; That way, they could prepare for a long war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I &nbsp;had heard that there was an underground passage that led to this one from the basement of the royal castle, so they were well prepared. I was relieved and excited by the technology of this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;ve got city defense barriers in place, and we&#39;ve got evacuation drills going on. As soon as we spot an enemy, we can escape immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s why the ministers didn&#39;t make any unreasonable demands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, that&#39;s why. Besides, I won&#39;t tolerate anyone who says anything stupid. I told them to quit their jobs and get out of the castle if they just want to whine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyone can complain. What&#39;s important is a positive opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm laughed when I said that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Looking back on the time when we first met, he has grown tremendously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was secretly reminded of the fact that we all grow up when the need arises.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After going back to the surface from the basement, I next headed for the training grounds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was also allowed to see the strength of the new Farmenas Kingdom Knights trained by Grucius.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were 500 knights of B rank and above, and 3,000 knights of C rank and below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they gathered all of the knights from all over Farmenas, there would be more than 40,000 knights. However, there was no point in gathering such a large number at this time, so they were giving priority to maintaining security.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well. If a huge army of angels attacked, there would be nothing we could do on the ground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I heard there was anti-aircraft magic, but there aren&#39;t many magicians. Rommel concluded that it would be better to focus on defending the city with legion magic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Larzen-san agreed, so we&#39;re training according to that policy. In other words, the Knight Order&#39;s mission is to free the people from those who come down to the earth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm and Grucius explained to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was relieved to see that they weren&#39;t too eager to take on the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was a little worried that you might be thinking about doing something reckless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, I&#39;m more timid than Phobio-sama. I know what I&#39;m capable of, so I won&#39;t be reckless. Well, since Larzen-san trained me, I think I&#39;m stronger than before. And just recently, my strength has suddenly increased. I&#39;m going to be a shield for everyone, to the extent that I won&#39;t be ashamed to be a leader.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grucius replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not that he&#39;s a coward, but that he possesses a quality that is essential for a commander&mdash;calm judgment. Grucius had a calculating side, so he didn&#39;t seem likely to misjudge the difference in strength between him and the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was also a curious comment about his &ldquo;sudden increase in strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, the amount of magicule in Grucius now seems to be comparable to that of the previous Beastketeers, so it seems to be equivalent to Special A rank. If his skill (level) was added on top of this, he must have grown to be a very strong asset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason for this is, without a doubt, the effect of Karion&#39;s awakening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though he became like a brother to Youm, he did not forget his respect for Karion. This was also a sign that Karion felt a strong bond with Grucius, his subordinate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s because Karion has awakened and evolved. It must have affected you, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karion-sama did!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. So don&#39;t ever waste that power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, I understand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This feels like a lecture. It&rsquo;s not my place to tell you that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Hahaha, not at all. I&#39;m glad to know why, and since His Majesty Rimuru</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt80" id="ftnt_ref80">[80]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;is someone Karion-sama approves of, I&#39;m grateful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m glad he doesn&rsquo;t think I&#39;m meddling in his affairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hope so. By the way, so Grucius is also being trained by Larzen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Larzen is the one who trained Grucius. I seemed to have remember him being the one who made ramen noodles, but I guess he must have been a wizard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How can Larzen be a match for Grucius?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Larzen-san is a jack-of-all-trades. His knowledge of magic rivals Myuran&#39;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Hey, don&#39;t address my wife that way</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt81" id="ftnt_ref81">[81]</a></sup><span class="c0">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up, she&rsquo;s eventually gonna be my&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fuck with me, you bastard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&#39;s enough fighting. So?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was tired of seeing them bicker on a comical level, so I asked them to move on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To summarize Grucius&#39; story, when Larzen took the body of the &ldquo;otherworlder&rdquo; (Shogo), he took his power as well. Of course, he did not take away the skill level of the otherworlder, but Larzen, who had gone through a certain amount of training, was a first-rate fencer as well as a wizard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As such, he was good at striking and kicking, which he passed on to Grucius.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t understand what he meant at first when he told me not to only fight with my natural physical abilities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grucius laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, well. Sare has more strength than Larzen, but he loses in arm wrestling. He&#39;s no match for him in a real fight, and I&#39;ve been impressed with him since he made his name in the Western Nations as the majin Larzen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s no wonder the Beastketeers were so cautious. But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s when Grucius stopped talking and looked at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he shook his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I understand, Grucius.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, Youm patted Grucius on the shoulder and looked at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While I was wondering what the hell was going on, they both looked at each other and sighed deeply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying that there&rsquo;s always someone better, boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. That Larzen-san was being played like a baby in front of Gadra-dono. I was stunned when I saw that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, so that&#39;s the story&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, Diablo had also said that Larzen was &ldquo;a small thing that doesn&#39;t matter,&rdquo; and we had a lot of people like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra is certainly strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is no doubt about it, but I feel that he&rsquo;s still a mid-tier level in our country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He seems to have evolved in a strange way after becoming a member of Diablo&#39;s faction, so his current rank may have changed, but he still doesn&#39;t seem to be within the top ranks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Talking about this, I wondered what Gadra was doing now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, I don&#39;t see Larzen or Gadra around, are they doing something somewhere?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm replies with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Training, they&rsquo;re training. They participated in the meeting to pick up the boss and to discuss future developments, but other than that, they&#39;ve been fighting all this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For real!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grucius nodded, so he must be telling the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought Gadra was the intellectual type, but I didn&#39;t know he liked to fight so much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Did Diablo have a bad influence on him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such fears began flashing through my mind, but I quickly dismissed them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you&#39;re curious, I&#39;ll show you around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I took Youm at his word and decided to visit Gadra and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The destination was a plain about an hour&#39;s ride away by carriage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a simple hut, similar to a guest house, that stood there. There was nothing else, just wasteland as far as the eye could see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">According to Youm, there were only four people living there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Needless to say, the four were Larzen, the best of the Farmenas Kingdom, Sare and Grigori, formerly of the Three Martial Sages, and Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a very interesting combination, but when we arrived, they had all lined up to greet us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was strange to see Gadra leading the way, acting like a representative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We are very pleased that you have come to such a place!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At Gadra&#39;s signal, the three remaining members of the group bowed their heads.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not to Youm, but to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, hey, I&#39;m here, too, aren&#39;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your Majesty, Sare and Grigori are guests of Farmenas, but it is not you they are loyal to. Therefore, they are paying their respects to His Majesty Rimuru, the Lord of Gadra-sama, by their own will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I get it. You don&#39;t even have to say anything, you&#39;re always lecturing me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Larzen rebuked Youm&#39;s complaining, but their relationship was more familiar than I had expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Larzen&#39;s true intentions are unknown, but his position is that of a loyal vassal of Farmenas. I had thought that he held no loyalty to Youm, but judging from his attitude, it seemed that he cared for him in his own way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, aside from Gadra and Larzen, I don&#39;t remember being respected by Sare and Grigori&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyway, if they&rsquo;re doing this of their own will, why me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was curious, so I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm seemed to be curious, as if he had never heard of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they wanted to move to my country, I could consider accepting them. Hinata didn&rsquo;t seem to have any intention of seeking out Sare and the others as traitors and executing them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clear reason. Master Larzen taught us about our inexperience, and Guru Gadra</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt82" id="ftnt_ref82">[82]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;taught us about the greatness of His Majesty Rimuru. We were so impressed that we wished to be included at the bottom of your ranks!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guru!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. Well, Gadra-sama&#39;s strength was unimaginable, but from what I heard he&rsquo;s not even close to His Majesty Rimuru. No! Even before that! I&#39;ve heard that His Majesty Rimuru has a lot of powerful people under his command that even Gadra-sama cannot match, and we want to test our strength&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ranga jumped out from behind me while Grigori was making his speech.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well said! You are Grigori, I knew you&#39;d be a sight to behold! If it&#39;s all right with you, then I&#39;ll give you a test of strength!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&ndash;Ge, Gyaaah!! That dog guy from back then!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, no&hellip;Ranga-dono, wasn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grigori is shaking and sweating profusely. He had been badly beaten by Ranga before&mdash;had he been traumatized since then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, it can&rsquo;t be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If that&#39;s the case, why don&#39;t you let Ranga deal with him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lord, it would be my pleasure!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come, Grigori. Let us get out of the way so that my lords are not disturbed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, hold on!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ranga grabbed Grigori&#39;s head in his mouth and ran happily away. I couldn&#39;t see Grigori&#39;s face, but I&#39;m sure he was happy that his wish came true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I saw him and Ranga off with warm eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t just me, but all the people present as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&#39;d like to test my skills too, but I&#39;m still inexperienced, so I&#39;d like to start from the bottom&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sare said awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s true. Ranga is my bodyguard, so he&rsquo;s one of the best. I thought Grigori-san was a challenger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! He&#39;s got a phobia of dogs since he lost to Ranga-dono. I think he wanted to overcome it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hearing Sare&#39;s comment, Larzen was holding his head in disgust. Youm and Gadra were chatting amicably beside him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even I am not a match for Ranga-dono&hellip;What a fool he is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, that sure is some rough treatment. That&rsquo;s amazing, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever be able to do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t do it. Your Majesty is a king. You don&#39;t need to be strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve always wanted to be strong, but I know my own strength. Once you get to know Boss Rimuru, it&#39;s obvious that a little strength is useless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s not useless. Even in the worst case, if we stay alive, we might be able to help in time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. Well, I&#39;ll do what I can to protect the ones I love.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think that&#39;s a good idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm seems to be becoming more aware of his role as king.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t lose, either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t intend to be as crazy as Grigori, but I am determined to do what I can, step by step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Larzen also seems to approve of Youm now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As long as Your Majesty Youm serves this country, I will do my best to help you. Well, Her Royal Highness Princess Meme is the one I am going to make my apprentice, as I promised Queen Myuran, so I&#39;ll protect her before anyone else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What a thing to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Youm should be relieved to know that he has someone who has supported the Farmus Kingdom for hundreds of years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for me, I was thinking of something else. I was puzzled by the fact that Larzen spoke in an old man&#39;s manner despite his youthful appearance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the meantime, Ranga returned with a limp Grigori in his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lord, after a little play time, this person has stopped working!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Too much!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re not Shion, so can&#39;t you take it easy on him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I scolded him severely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And when I diagnosed Grigori, it turned out that he had just fainted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&#39;s that guy, isn&#39;t he? Why did suddenly nominate Ranga?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I understand the desire for revenge, but I also think one should know where they stand&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, Boss, I don&#39;t think that was it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rather, he said he never wanted to fight, never wanted to see him again&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm and Sare pointed this out, but perhaps I was the one misunderstanding? Sare said something different what what he said before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So maybe he wasn&rsquo;t happy to see Ranga again and just wanted to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;No, I don&#39;t think that&rsquo;s the case. He was brave. He was unyielding, even against a man he&#39;d already been defeated by. I was, you know, impressed with him. That&#39;s why I allowed him to fight Ranga. Right, Ranga?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Admitting a mistake is a liability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fortunately, Grigori was safe, so I decided to play it cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And on top of that, Ranga played nicely into it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re right! I was so overwhelmed by this man&#39;s spirit that I overdid it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, he&#39;s really good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s brilliantly correcting his mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know who he&#39;s taken after, but I think Ranga has become cunning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it seems that our teamwork has convinced Youm and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly as Rimuru-sama says. Isn&#39;t that right, you guys?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yes. If that&#39;s what the Boss says, then I guess that&#39;s what it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m particularly dissatisfied. Sare, wasn&rsquo;t it your misunderstanding?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Well, Grigori sure has become a gutsy man&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is no problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Now that I have a little respect for you, I&#39;ll call you Grigori &lsquo;-san&rsquo; from now on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So that&#39;s what happened&hellip;When Grigori himself woke up, he politely declined my offer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, all my business in the Farmenas Kingdom was finished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm and I discussed the matter and agreed that Sare and Grigori would be accepted and trained in our country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was concerned that their forces would be reduced, but they should be able to handle it since Gadra was still there. They also have Larzen, and unless there is a major invasion by the enemy, they should be able to buy some time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, if such a situation had occurred, even with Sare and Grigori, it would have been a drop in the bucket. That&#39;s why I chose to develop my skills in preparation for an emergency, rather than worrying about such an eventuality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, the power ratio of Larzen and the others was very interesting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we simply compare the approximate amount of magicules, the order is Sare, Larzen, Grigori, and Grucius (from highest to lowest).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Youm, I&#39;m sorry to say, is out of the question. With Hakurou&#39;s hellish training and the performance of his equipment, he is barely in the A rank. We couldn&#39;t hope to increase his strength in the short term.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grucius was an elite of the Beast King&#39;s Warriors. Thanks to the gift from Karion&rsquo;s awakening, he has grown to the level of Grigori, one of the former &lsquo;Three Martial Sages.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it was a problem for the Knight Commander to leave his home country, and he did not want to, so I did not bring him back. He said he would come to visit us after all the problems were settled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first person who came to our country, was Grigori.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He is a strong man with the special ability of &#39;immobility.&rsquo; He prefers to use a battle axe spear (halberd), but he is also good at hand-to-hand combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although he was defeated by Ranga, he was a &ldquo;Sage Class&rdquo; comparable to a Demon Lord Seed and had an existence value of about 400,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was much stronger than I expected, so there is a possibility that he might turn into one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The second person who came to our country, was Sare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He used to be the first knight of the Imperial Guards, but he was defeated by Hinata and gave up his position. Then he challenged Diablo as one of the &ldquo;Three Martial Sages&rdquo; and has been here ever since.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, it was simply the wrong opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that like Grigori, Sare was a man without luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, his ability is real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The value of Sare&#39;s existence that had led to Saint had surprisingly reached a million. It would certainly be interesting to have him challenge the labyrinth in the form of a real battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the way, Larzen only had a few more magicules than Grigori, but his ability was greater than Sare&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When he took Shogo Taguchi&#39;s body, he gained the Unique Skills &#39;Berserker&#39; and &#39;Survivor&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">According to Ciel-san, there are cases where Unique Skill is rooted in the mind, cases where it is engraved in the soul, and cases where it resides in the astral body, spiritual body, or material body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is also the power to steal Skill from enemies, but it seems that this is only possible if it is in the body. As an exception, it seems that there are Skills that reside in the soul, and in such cases, they can be taken away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, is it harder to take something that&#39;s engraved in your soul?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;It is not absolute. But if it is rooted in the heart, it is impossible&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She explained confidently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it seems that it can still be copied without being taken, so it is possible to commit foul acts like with Michael&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I digress, but that&rsquo;s why Larzen, who had acquired two Unique Skills, was said to be more proficient in using them than Shogo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, he overwhelmed Sare, who had about twice his magicule count.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it seems that this was only the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sare had a unique skill called &#39;The All-Knowing One&#39;, which allowed him to recognize and master his opponent&#39;s Art just by seeing it once. When Larzen learned of this, he taught Sare all of the skills and magic he knew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Magic is both an art and a skill that comes from knowledge. It was not easy to learn, but Sare did not complain and asked Larzen to teach him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is the reason why Sare called Larzen his master.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is why Sare is now stronger than Larzen in both name and reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, Gadra seems to have beaten him to the punch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The comparison of existence values is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;Disclosing information about Gadra&#39;s&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Name: Gadra [EP: 1,126,666]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Race: greater chaos spirit &mdash; metal demon</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Blessing: Black Primordial (Noir)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Title: Servant #2 &ldquo;Pochi</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt83" id="ftnt_ref83">[83]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Magic: &#12296;dark magic&#12297;&#12296;elemental magic&#12297;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Skill: Ultimate Gift &#39; Grimoire &#39;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Resistance: Physical Attack Nullification , Abnormal Condition Nullification , Mental Attack Nullification , Natural Effects Nullification , Holy-Demonic Attack Resistance</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve found a lot of things to complain about, but I&#39;m too tired to talk about them, so I&#39;ll leave it at that. For now, I&#39;ll discuss the comparison with Sare, but it looks &nbsp;like Gadra outperforms him by EP alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To be honest, I didn&#39;t expect him to be this strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra wasn&#39;t that strong before he was reborn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His knowledge of magic was outstanding, and his skill (level) was remarkable, but he was not a threat if we judged him only in terms of combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was cunning and troublesome. If he was going to be an adversary, he should be the first to go for. That was my true evaluation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, Gadra did the right thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&#39;s still alive, and he&#39;s in my direct line of command. And he&#39;s even surpassed Saint Sare in direct combat ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sare&#39;s &lsquo;Omnipotent One&rsquo; is also troublesome, but it&#39;s surprisingly easy to deal with. All you have to do is to challenge it in a straightforward manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can overwhelm it with physics, without the use of art or magic. Even if you do use them, you should do so in a timely manner to avoid being imitated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is said that Sare was defeated by Hinata, but I can guess the reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata would never be careless, so she must have fought without exposing her cards to Sare. In that case, he would have lost the advantage of the Unique Skill, because he had nothing to learn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And this time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The decisive difference in Gadra&#39;s case must have been the presence or absence of the Ultimate Gift.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gadra was cunning, so he might not have shown Sare his hidden tricks. But even if he had, Sare would not have been able to imitate it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because the unique level cannot compete with the ultimate level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, I realized once again that being able to give an Ultimate Gift to a subordinate like me must be a quite the foul move.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, the power of the Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Grimoire&rsquo; was very similar to that of Adalman&#39;s &lsquo;Necronomicon.&rsquo; This included &lsquo;Thought Acceleration,&rsquo; &lsquo;Universal Perception,&rsquo; &lsquo;Demon Lord Haki,&rsquo; &lsquo;Chant Cancellation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Analyze and Assess,&rsquo; &lsquo;All of Creation,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mental Crush,&rsquo; &lsquo;Knowledge Browsing,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Concept Sharing.&rsquo; &lsquo;Knowledge Browsing&rsquo; seems to be an ability to learn from Ciel-san. And &#39;Concept Sharing&#39; seems to be the right to share with Adalman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, like Ciel-san, it seemed to be a &nbsp;skill that embodied Gadra&#39;s desires.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, I understand why Gadra is stronger than Sare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I also now have a rough idea of how powerful Sare is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I recall, the Holy Knight Order had been working hard to conquer the labyrinth, but was their current ranking at Apito&#39;s level?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was before Adalman&#39;s evolution, so it&#39;s not very useful&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I heard that they came to visit us recently, and that he had collected some data. Arno and Reynald were extremely strong, with existence values of nearly 500,000. The remaining captains were also around 300,000 each and seemed to have grown significantly compared to their initial levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since they were in the same level range as Grigori, it would be interesting to have them form a party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sare, on the other hand, had the advantage of learning the Arts easily, so it might be better to leave it to Hakurou.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He could be a good training partner for the children, and I thought he could also learn a lot in our country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, that should be kept confidential.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the training plan for Sare and Grigori was decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the time being, I decided to let Sare and Grigori familiarize themselves with the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru had been informed of the training plan and would be sent to his own place when the time was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Will I be taking care of them again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m counting on you. It&rsquo;s sudden with Hakurou, so there might be some confusion, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true. But we&rsquo;re all in the same situation, and I think you&#39;re being too overprotective.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru chuckled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You may have a point, but they are our guests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they had immigrated to our country, I would not have allowed them to be too unreasonable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">More importantly, speaking of training.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what&#39;s the status of Karion and the others?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, things are getting interesting over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as Benimaru said that, Ciel-san disclosed the information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Name: Karion [EP: 2,773,537]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Race: Beast God (Ju-Xin).

I guess it is within the margin of error.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their skills and resistances are unknown, but there is no way to know that unless they tell me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, both of these people have awakened to become True Demon Lords, and are undisputedly strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In my case, the amount of magicules had increased tenfold, but Karion and Frey-san didn&rsquo;t seem to have increased by that much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or rather, there seem to be individual differences.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My impression is that Karion&#39;s pre-evolutionary value was around 700,000, and Frey-san&#39;s was less than 400,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Assuming that I&#39;m right, Karion&#39;s strength has increased fourfold and Frey-san&#39;s strength has increased fivefold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, in my case, it&#39;s because the original values were low, wasn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you think about it, it&rsquo;s natural.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We should consider not how many times the original value has increased, but rather how much it has increased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not wrong to say that the greater the existence value, the greater the power when awakened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now, let&#39;s analyze their strength based on this information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion&#39;s physical abilities nearly tripled when he transformed, but I don&#39;t think they doubled if we converted them into existence values.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was thinking that it was probably just an ability boost for a certain amount of time. That&#39;s why I believed that shapeshifting was not completely foolproof.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because if you transformed, you would become weaker after the time limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is true not only for Karion, but also for Gabil and the others. Otherwise, the best idea would be to maintain the transformed state at all times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, there were still many advantages to transforming, such as the healing of all wounds and the full recovery of physical strength. These are characteristics unique to beastmen, so I don&#39;t mean to make fun of them. In short, it depends on how you use it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, in the case of the evolved Karion, how well is he able to use his power?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s he like now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. First up was Karion-dono, who I took on first for revenge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, I led a team to Yuurazania once. I was no match for him then. That&#39;s why I wanted to see how strong I had become now, and to test myself against Karion-dono, who had awakened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Um, I think you&#39;ve got it backwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was planning to have Karion and the others test their strength to the fullest../.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wondered why Benimaru was testing his own strength, but after thinking about it, I didn&rsquo;t see the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru got serious, and Karion gave it his all. In the environment of the labyrinth, where no one dies, this seemed to be a very interesting combination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sure Ramiris and the others were recording it, so I&#39;ll watch it later. With that, I decided to ask about the result first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who won?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By a narrow margin, me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that&#39;s good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While I admired him, I was actually slightly troubled by the reaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For some reason, I realized that I hadn&#39;t doubted Benimaru&#39;s victory, and I was upset when I heard that it was a close call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But it was a close call. How did that happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At any rate, I asked him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Benimaru could reply, an image appeared in my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;It seems that Karion made the first move&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As expected of Ciel-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It looks like she got the information right away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And as Ciel-san explained, it was Karion who moved first in the video.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the moment he raised his weapon and sank in a flowing manner, Karion&#39;s entire body turned into light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not a metaphor, but a real particle that attacked Benimaru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;Karion named it Burst Roar. It is an illusionary diffusion-focused particle cannon that can transform his own body into willful particles that pierces the enemy&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, it has a will then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It means that Karion had also awakened and acquired the characteristics of a spiritual life form. It was also understandable that the light that had followed Benimaru swallowed him up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;The moment the game started, I got chills, or rather, I sensed that it was going to be dangerous. So, I decided that this was not the time to wait and see, and activated my &lsquo;Heat Haze</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt84" id="ftnt_ref84">[84]</a></sup><span class="c0">&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s &lsquo;Heat Haze&rsquo; is a power that can be called the ultimate secret of &#39;Formhide.&rsquo; It prevents any attack from catching you, so it will only work if you have the Ultimate Skill on top of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, if that had not been activated, Benimaru would have lost in the first move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, Karion embodied a speed several hundred times faster than the speed of sound, comparable to that of Velgrynd&#39;s super speed attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s evasion of the attack was amazing, but there was nothing he could do if he had been tracked from there. It was because of his Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Heat King (Amaterasu)&rsquo; that he was able to withstand this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your intuition and your Ultimate Skill were the difference between victory and defeat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, it was a close call. I was so proud of myself that I thought I could win more easily, so it was a good reminder for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right. I didn&#39;t doubt you&#39;d win, so I had mixed feelings about it. After all, carelessness and pride can lead to defeat. It&#39;s hard to be aware of, so I&#39;m grateful you realized this before the showdown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Even if I&rsquo;m aware of it, I can be unconsciously proud of it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called carelessness, but it can be scary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We were grateful to Karion for reminding us of our lack of awareness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After reflecting with Benimaru, I relaxed with a caf&eacute; au lait brewed by Shuna and listened to the rest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you fight with Frey-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I think Frey-dono saw us fighting and decided she couldn&#39;t win. She seems like the type who hates wasting time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, so that&#39;s how it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I nodded my head, agreeing with Benimaru&rsquo;s conclusion. Frey-san is not particularly belligerent, so I can understand her reaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, I had heard Milim complaining about Frey-san&#39;s meticulous nature. I&#39;ve heard that she&rsquo;s been having a lot of trouble with it, but it&#39;s none of my business, so I&rsquo;ll just ignore it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;After that, it was a matter of trying to conquer the labyrinth to see how far they could go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you want to test your strength, that&rsquo;s probably the quickest way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Each one started at the fifty-first level, individually.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Benimaru explained, images began flooding my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ciel-san is a being of many talents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">First, Karion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The power that affected Benimaru was serious, and he continued to make good progress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The 60th level was cleared easily due to Gadra&#39;s absence. Though at this rate, even if he had stayed, he would have been defeated. That&#39;s how unstoppable Karion&#39;s momentum was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He also fought Adalman and the others, who happened to be back to adjust the magic transfer circle, as a test of his skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a result, he easily defeated them even though it was three against one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That wasn&rsquo;t surprising. He was using Burst Roar generously, so Adalman and the others had no time to take countermeasures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wenti acted as the shield, Albert as &nbsp;the ranger, and Adalman as the attacker. That combination fell apart when Wenti was first defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion then went after the troublesome Adalman, leaving Albert behind. The way he fought was reminiscent of a lion on the hunt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;It is the female lion that does most of the hunting&hellip;&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I know that!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ciel-san&#39;s explanation is very useful, but sometimes it makes me feel like a fool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s always been that way, even since the days of the &lsquo;Great Sage,&rsquo; right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;I&#39;ll be careful&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Really, please do,&rsquo; I nodded, greatly offended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, back to the topic at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion&#39;s Burst Roar was incredibly powerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Adalman had a light attribute, but Karion was also a light attribute. There was no difference between them, so it was just a matter of simple strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The interesting to notice here was that Adalman has an Ultimate Gift.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion does not seem to have an Ultimate Skill, nor does he have mythical-grade equipment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, how was he able to beat Adalman?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I seem to remember Ciel-san saying that the ultimate level can only be beaten by another ultimate power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;I don&#39;t remember&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, is that so?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I feel like I&#39;ve been deceived, but I&#39;m not so sure either&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;Karion also possesses the characteristics of a spiritual life form, so his strength of will must have been able to rival the ultimate power&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see, that makes sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, Karion has more offensive power than the &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier&rsquo; reinforced by Adalman&#39;s &lsquo;Necronomicon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The next opponent to face Karion-dono was Kumara. Kumara wanted to fight first, so I gave her permission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Zegion is stronger than Kumara, so maybe we should rethink the labyrinth floor guardian placements.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. And as it turns out, it was a pretty good match.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Again, a video was shown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kumara hadn&#39;t shown her tailed beasts and was going all out from the start.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had heard the news of Adalman and the others&#39; defeat, but seemed to be going into battle without listening to the details.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is a big difference between knowing what the enemy is up to and not knowing. And yet, she dared to challenge the enemy on equal terms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion was superior in existence value. However, Kumara had the Ultimate Gift &lsquo;Beast King Bahamut.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Again, Karion made his first move with a Burst Roar. This time, it became several flashes of light, aiming at Kumara from all directions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kumara, on the other hand, flew to the sky and invoked &lsquo;Gravity Domination.&rsquo; This caused the light to bend due to the super gravity, and Karion&#39;s attack only pierced Kumara&#39;s leg.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was not Kumara&#39;s intended evasion, but was just her luck. That&#39;s why she did not counterattack, but instead prioritized her own recovery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or is it possible to substitute with the legs of a tailed beast instead? The tailed beasts can be resurrected by Kumara&#39;s magicules, so it would be difficult to disable Kumara with an opponent of the same level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Karion, who failed in his first attack, had materialized. The particle state, which seemed to be invincible, still had a time limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And it looks like it cannot be fired repeatedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Karion did not chase Kumara, but instead kept his distance and set up a &lsquo;White Tiger-Blue Dragon Strike.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt85" id="ftnt_ref85">[85]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kumara looked down at Karion from above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion stared at her and considered his next move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A picture containing text, book

Some people say that teaching others is like being given an opportunity to realize what you lack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think he meant that if someone asks you something you don&#39;t know, you should look it up immediately and use it to your advantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this case, I felt that he learned how to fight more carefully by training with Karion in actual combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion seemed to be getting more and more sophisticated in his fighting style.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Kumara had taken him on before Adalman, the odds would have been more likely to be reversed. That was how well Karion had developed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess Zegion was in danger, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t imagine Zegion being defeated, but at this rate&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that was out of the question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Facing off, Karion-dono was the first to set up&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The imaged played out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle was instantaneous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Karion could turn into a particles&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s wrong. Immediately after Zegion smiled at him as if he were an illusion, Karion&#39;s entire body was cut into pieces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Instant kill, what is Zegion really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To be honest, it&#39;s almost a miracle that I was able to beat him. If I tried now, I don&#39;t think I could win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru chuckled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He may have been being modest, but if Benimaru, who hated to lose, was saying as much, then Zegion truly was exceptional.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Zegion had been defeated here, it would have required a fundamental review of our defense system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Zegion doesn&#39;t seem to be very prideful. We&#39;ve reaffirmed our own lack of awareness, but that seems unnecessary for Zegion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Agreed. He&#39;s extremely stoic. It was the most complete victory he&#39;s ever had, but he didn&#39;t seem satisfied at all, saying &lsquo;This isn&#39;t even close to Rimuru-sama.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wondered if Zegion was aiming for an imaginary me&mdash;I felt very far away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karion&#39;s challenge was over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So then, what about Frey-san?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Frey-dono also defeated Adalman and the others. Quite handily, at that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Too unexpected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was expecting Adalman and his team to win this game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had thought Frey-San would win in a one-on-one match, but that Adalman and the others would have the advantage in a three-on-one match&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After watching the video, I understood why Frey-san won.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, they were too incompatible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Frey-dono&#39;s &lsquo;Magic Interference&rsquo; blocked Adalman&#39;s magic. The reason for the defeat was that this disrupted his offensive pattern and allowed Frey-dono to control the pace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru&#39;s explanation was correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A circle of fifty meters in radius around Frey-san had become an anti-magic area, blocking the movement of magicules. Because the interference wave was more powerful than that of the Charybdis, it had also blocked Adalman&#39;s &#39;Necronomicon&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the way, Frey-san also had divinity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since divinity seems to be a trait that can only be acquired by a spiritual lifeform whose life span has expired, it was no surprise that Frey-san was able to compete with the Ultimate Gift.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the contrary, there was a possibility that Frey-san might have acquired an Ultimate Skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this point, Adalman switched to Holy Magic: Holy Cannon as his main tool, but it was not a decisive move. The trouble was that Frey-san could fly, so she was able to evade it with a flick of her wrist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She then closed in on Wenti, who was acting as a shield, and grabbed her with her claws.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The trouble is Frey-dono&#39;s claws. They disrupt the body&rsquo;s magicules, so they are a monster&#39;s natural enemy. Once they grabs you, it&rsquo;s like having all of your skills and magic blocked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frey-san&#39;s claws were definitely a mythical-grade level of danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow, if I didn&#39;t know better, I&rsquo;d say I might have been in danger too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, you&#39;re okay, right? In the case of Rimuru-sama, you can escape with &lsquo;Clone.&rsquo; However, Karion-dono also said it was impossible to escape from, so I&rsquo;d be in trouble too. I&rsquo;d just beat her before she caught me, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In Benimaru&#39;s case, that was probably true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But for Adalman and the others, it was impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wenti was destroyed from the inside and left the battlefield. After that, Frey-san changed her strategy to a long-distance battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since Adalman and his team&#39;s flight was blocked, they could only be attacked one-sidedly from above. Albert, impatient with this, leapt and aimed at Frey-san, but that was exactly what Frey-san wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The title of &ldquo;Sky Queen&rdquo; was not lost upon Albert, and he too was scattered in the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, Adalman was the only one left, but he had no chance to win. Sadly, he was forced to defeat before Frey-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Frey-dono also moved on to the next opponent, which was a battle against Kumara.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What was the result?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were almost evenly matched in strength, but Kumara is not divine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, judging from the way she just fought, Frey-san had quite a bit of combat experience. She had said herself that she was the weakest of the ten demon lords, but it seemed that she was being modest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cunning Frey-san and the inexperienced Kumara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought it would be a good match, and I guess I was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was a great match. They fought for three whole days, and both of them gave it their all. I&#39;d call it a draw, but the winner was Frey-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, that was a great battle. I&#39;ll study the footage later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I learned a lot. The indomitable spirit to never give up on victory is important, but in the end, it&#39;s the intelligence that counts. When you have a strong opponent, it is important to mislead your opponent about your strength. The reason for Kumara&#39;s defeat was that she misjudged her opponent&#39;s remaining strength.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the video.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was three days&#39; worth of information, so I&rsquo;d watch it at several times the speed using Thought Acceleration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, did Frey-san challenge Zegion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If she was on par with Kumara, she was bound to lose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seemed to me that Frey-san, who had avoided a fight with Benimaru, would not participate in a fight with an obvious outcome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She was fighting Apito, not Zegion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh, is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. After all, she must have had her pride as someone of flight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She seemed reasonable, but she was surprisingly competitive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was a good match, but Frey-dono won by a landslide.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s about right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it was a good match, I should have congratulated Apito on her good performance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, now I knew what Frey-san was capable of, and I could see what my friends had to work on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It must have been a shock for Adalman and his group, who had to suffer a series of defeats as soon as they came back to our country in the middle of their work, but I hope they would be grateful that this was not the real battle and use this experience in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Also, I might have sold my debt to Karion and Frey-san. This was also thanks to Ramiris, so I&rsquo;d tell them to thank her later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I also thanked Ramiris once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now, onto the real issue at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll leave you in charge of Sare and the others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir. Well, let&#39;s see if they can get past Adalman and the others, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree with you. Maybe, Albert can handle it on his own. Just don&#39;t keep Adalman and the others around forever!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having just vowed to not let my guard down, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this prediction was wrong. But Sare was no match for even Master Gadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be difficult for him to get past Adalman and the others, I thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That prediction proved to be correct. Sare and his team decided to train with Apito instead of Adalman and his team who returned to their work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After leaving Sare and the others with Benimaru, I headed for the Blumund Kingdom, where Myourmiles was waiting for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The plan was to meet them there and have them accompany us to the Ingracia Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had been to Blumund Kingdom many times before, so I &nbsp;was familiar with it. Since we were not going into the city, there was no need to go through the &lsquo;Barrier.&rsquo; We went to the outskirts of the capital as if we were sightseeing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was also the center of a big project.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The &ldquo;World Station&rdquo; was currently under construction, and workers from neighboring countries had been gathering there. Not far from there, in a prime location, the headquarters of the Four Nations Trade Federation was being built.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I&#39;m pretty happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a ten-story skyscraper over 30 meters high, which was rare in this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While it was not as high as Milim&rsquo;s new castle, it was still one of the tallest buildings in this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I had tried to elaborate on the design and used precious glass extravagantly. Of course, it was a tempered glass made of &ldquo;maka,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt87" id="ftnt_ref87">[87]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo; which was resistant to typhoons, earthquakes, and magical attacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had many other hobbies and interests, so I was very attached to this building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was where we were meeting today, or rather, where we were planning to have a party to celebrate the new building. I was actually the owner of the building, but was treated as an invited guest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And now, I had finally arrived in front of the building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I would have liked to come and see the building when it was completed, but I had been so busy lately that I haven&#39;t had time. So, I left all the arrangements for the building&#39;s staff to Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was hard work for me, but it must have been hard work for Myourmiles too. Without Myourmiles, I wouldn&#39;t be able to see this day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I knew that he was capable, but he also seemed to have a talent for charity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The representative of the &lsquo;Four Nations Trade Federation&rsquo; is Myourmiles, but the head of this building was someone else. To my surprise, Veryard, who had recently been promoted to the rank of Viscount, was now Myourmiles&#39; subordinate. I was informed that he had been appointed as the general manager.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am honestly happy and relieved that Veryard has become my ally. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the skill with which he deceived me, and I hope to see more of him in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have heard that he has recruited several other talented people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He said he would introduce them to me at the party today, and I was looking forward to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As usual, Souei and I stand side by side, with Ranga in the shadows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We were dressed in formal suits today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was wearing a three-piece suit and Souei was wearing a two-piece suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The color of the suit was gray for me and black for Souei. It was one that Shuna had tailored for us, using the now-branded Hellmoth thread.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since it was custom-made and not sold in the market, anyone who saw it would have noticed the difference in quality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A picture containing text, person, outdoor, standing

He&#39;s like a big brother protecting his little brother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The little brother is cute too, I can&#39;t wait to see what he becomes in the future!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&#39;s cool. There have been a lot of foreigners visiting these days, but it&#39;s still rare to see someone so cool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&hellip;Hmm?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s not the reaction I was expecting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I guess she was just interested in Souei, not my charisma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I realized that I was being too self-conscious and felt a little embarrassed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, why don&#39;t we just go in and say hello first?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I said so, trying to cover up my embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, I went through the door to the reception desk. The first floor was a large floor like a hotel lobby, divided into a waiting area and a long room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since I already knew the inside of the building, I proceeded without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is Myourmiles-kun here~?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I called out to the beautiful receptionist, a pompous man dressed in a fashionable suit with a cigar in his mouth came out of the back room and stared at me suspiciously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And just who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m Rimuru. Can you tell Myourmiles-kun that I&#39;m here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I said so with a smile, though I thought he was arrogant despite his gentlemanly appearance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The receptionist, hearing my name, quickly changed her complexion and reached for the crystal ball. It was also a magic tool that allowed you to communicate with another crystal ball. The disadvantage was that it could only be used at a short distance, but it was the best item for inside the building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That response was just as I&#39;d trained it to be, so I was content to watch&hellip;Suddenly, an important man stopped the receptionist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, Gabbana-sama, this person is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&#39;ll take care of this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am here. There are people who tell lies in order to meet Myourmiles-sama. There are also a lot of fools who try to attend parties they weren&#39;t invited to, and well, it&#39;s not easy being famous. He doesn&#39;t understand much about that, so he needs good subordinates like me. You were unlucky, too. If I hadn&#39;t been here, perhaps you would have succeeded.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haa, I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What else am I supposed to say here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The receptionist seemed to know my name, but this gentleman&mdash;Gabbana, didn&#39;t seem to know anything about me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, maybe he did know me, but the face and the name didn&#39;t match.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Judging from the situation, he didn&rsquo;t seem to be in charge of the reception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wondered if maybe he was just a dirty old man who wanted to look good in front of this beautiful receptionist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama. I will educate this man myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Souei, who had been quietly losing his temper, glared at Gabbana with steely eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait! Myourmiles-kun is training him, so let&#39;s not let a few misunderstandings get in the way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s just be kind here, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, Myourmiles had probably refrained from picking us up because he was busy, but it turned out to be a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabbana&#39;s pompous attitude may be questionable, but with so many unannounced visitors, this kind of reaction might be inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I was calming down the angry Souei, the receptionist shouted out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gabbana-sama! This person is the real deal!! She looks exactly like the portrait on display in Myourmiles-sama&#39;s room, there&#39;s no doubt about it!!&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eh, he has a portrait?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had noticed that he had one when I visited his house, but I didn&#39;t know he still had it. Myourmiles surer was a strange man to display it so proudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, the original Shizu-san was a beautiful woman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can understand why one might be attracted to her, but my figure is that of an elementary school student&mdash;well, now that I think about it, I&#39;ve grown up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was just under 160 centimeters, which is about the average height of a high school girl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t have much of a chest, but I might be beautiful in a portrait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, I couldn&#39;t sit still, so I would have to ask Ciel-san to take over the inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;I have no intention of becoming a model for a painting, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I was trapped in such an advanced level of thought, I heard Gabbana&#39;s astonished voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wh-What? You mean to tell me that this brat&mdash;I mean, this young master, is His Majesty Rimuru himself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I&#39;m sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, isn&rsquo;t that crazy!? Isn&rsquo;t he a demon lord? A king who controls such a vast territory is walking around with only one bodyguard&mdash;just by using common sense there is no way, so how&mdash;!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmm, that&rsquo;s also true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Shuna said when we were on our way to Dwargon, we needed to behave in a way that was appropriate for our rank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I skipped it because we didn&rsquo;t have much time at the time, but Shuna seemed to be unhappy about it. After all, I should probably be more careful in the future to avoid this kind of thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know that, but it&#39;s true!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I mean, would a demon lord just drop by the reception desk and casually ask, &lsquo;Is Myourmiles-kun here~?&rsquo;&mdash;You wouldn&#39;t, would you? Right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabbana makes his case with tears in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he admits this reality, he will be left with nothing but the fact that he tried to turn a demon lord away. In Gabbana&#39;s position, he would desperately want to deny it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The gentleman&#39;s mask is off and he&#39;s showing his true colors&hellip;I&#39;m starting to feel sorry for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, okay? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna call my subordinates over now&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At your request, I can call in the stealth force?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I don&#39;t want that! So, I&rsquo;ll just say that Gabbana-san was not at fault this time, and I&rsquo;ll drop the matter. Can you get Myourmiles-kun on it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I suggested this, Gabbana&#39;s face lit up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I-Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wouldn&#39;t that make both of us happier?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as I said that, tears welled up in Gabbana&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know how he misunderstood, but he looked at me with sparkling eyes and said, &ldquo;Thank you very much! I will never forget this favor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As for me, I felt a little uncomfortable, because I just wanted to cover up my mistakes as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Gabbana was thanking me more than necessary, the receptionist called for Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With Gabbana and the receptionist bowing us off, we made our way to Myourmiles&#39; office.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a spacious room on the top floor, with plenty of sunlight and a great view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We sat down on the best sofas and enjoyed the view, while quenching our thirst with the juice that had been prepared for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama, did something happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, nothing at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&#39;s good, but perhaps Gabbana has done something rude&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, it&#39;s okay!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I calmed down the worried Myourmiles and casually changed the subject.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;More importantly, Myourmiles-kun. I heard that you have a portrait of me in your room. What does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I asked, keeping my gaze fixed on a point on the wall and maintaining my composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gweh!? W-Well, that&#39;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The painting seems to have been acquired on the black market. However, not only is the source unknown, but so is the identity of the artist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There was one with the appearance of a slime, so it must be the work of someone who knows Rimuru-sama, but even our intelligence network can&#39;t figure it out, so I guess they&rsquo;re pretty good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eh, wait a minute?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I mean, isn&rsquo;t this pretty bad?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you&#39;re saying Souei couldn&#39;t track him down even if he investigated?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m afraid so, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Since it was during the war, we judged this case to be of low importance. That&#39;s why we couldn&#39;t arrange a large number of personnel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see, that was one of the reasons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But still, it&#39;s weird to be used as a model for a painting by someone I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, the reporters of other countries have seen Rimuru-sama. I&#39;m sure some of them have a keen interest keeping the paintings, so isn&rsquo;t that strange?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It does bother me that even Souei and the others aren&#39;t sure who it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, there&rsquo;s no use thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, we&rsquo;ll confiscate the painting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;E-Eh!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I tried to persuade Myourmiles, who was surprised and displeased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or rather, it was already decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why should I let you display my portrait? Absolutely not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No-No way! That&#39;s high-handed. I don&#39;t even think any tyrant, ancient or modern, would do such a thing!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re overreacting! I mean, why are you resisting so much? I&#39;ll pay you for the painting, so this is confiscated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I said as such and collected the painting from the wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, the painting had been so beautified that I felt it was no longer me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To put it simply, there was nothing but the image of Shizu-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beauty and fragility were beautifully expressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was so excited about hanging Rimuru-sama&#39;s picture here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Souei patted the lamenting Myourmiles on the shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, it can&#39;t be helped. Then I&#39;ll give this to Myourmiles-dono as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;W-Well, that&#39;s&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myourmiles was surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The moment we saw the picture, Myourmiles and I had delicate expressions on our faces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a picture of a slime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, good for you, Myourmiles-kun. Take a look at that and give it a try.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, no, that&#39;s not right, what can I say&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, it is different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t think seeing me in slime form will get you fired up even one millimeter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That said, why does Souei have something like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I confiscated it during our investigation. There were a few other items leaked as well, so we recovered them all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just the slime portraits?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What&#39;s with the pause?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;Actually, Diablo took one from me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What the hell, that bastard!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I desperately resisted, but I was unable to do anything. I apologize.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, I understand. I&#39;ll make sure to take it back from Diablo and tell him not to bother you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo is a problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That bastard thinks too highly of me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The problem is that I can&#39;t completely deny my appearance, because it comes from Shizu-san. That is why I can&#39;t allow him to keep in his possession a picture that I don&#39;t even know whose work it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Souei smiled, as if he was relieved by my promise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myourmiles muttered, &ldquo;No, but&hellip;Then Souei-dono will still keep the painting?&rdquo; But that was probably an unnecessary worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Souei is very popular, so you can rest assured, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I said that, Myourmiles nodded with a delicate expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We ended the conversation by agreeing to investigate the source of the paintings thoroughly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With only a few hours left until nightfall, we got down to business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m glad to hear that your plans are going well, but what are your plans for the future?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s the thing.

Impressive, Myourmiles-kun. You&#39;ve got it all planned out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahaha! Of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We had been talking about the same thing over and over again and I was getting bored. Thanks to Myourmiles, we&rsquo;d be able to do it all at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, I&rsquo;ll just get a report from Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The plan was going well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that there was almost no one left to oppose the &lsquo;Three Drunk Sages (Riega)&rsquo; as they took over underground organizations one by one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They had also gained the trust of the public, and now there was no end to the number of noblemen from various countries who wanted to join.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s wonderful. You&#39;re doing so well it&#39;s almost scary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed, it is. In fact, Veryard-dono&#39;s skill is so great that he&#39;s been expanding his influence in ways I never thought possible. Frankly, he&#39;s better than I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry. I remember when Veryard-san took one over me. No wonder Myourmiles-kun thinks he&#39;s lost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hate to admit it, but he&#39;s a monster. I felt like he was reading my thoughts and leading me to wherever Veryard-dono wanted me to go. Perhaps he&rsquo;d be a better representative than me, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sure he&#39;s an excellent man, but whether or not he should be at the top of the organization is a different story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&#39;m not saying that because I&#39;m good friends with Myourmiles-kun, but because it&#39;s actually the boss&#39;s job to appreciate the hard work of his subordinates. When you&#39;re too good, it&#39;s hard to properly appreciate the achievements of others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I think I understand what Rimuru-sama is trying to say, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myourmiles was still unconvinced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, I&rsquo;d repeat it here. I could have laughed it off, but I thought it would be better to allay these fears in the early stages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;People have individual differences, and naturally, their abilities vary, don&#39;t they? That&#39;s why bosses are expected to assign tasks to their subordinates according to their abilities. On the other hand, people who can work on their own tend to finish everything on their own without relying on others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, when a person like that reaches the top, there&#39;s a pretty good chance he&#39;ll think he&#39;s the best and the right one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s what they call a one-man boss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They are certainly excellent, but some of them take the extreme view that their subordinates should be able to do their jobs and that they are incompetent if they fail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if the failure is caused by the boss who imposed an unreasonable workload on the subordinate, the boss who thinks he is right may blame the subordinate for the failure. It&rsquo;s even worse if it&rsquo;s the president.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There may be no one to point out the problem for fear of being fired, or even if there is, they may not listen to you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this respect, I believed that Myourmiles would be fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myourmiles may be a bit of a &lsquo;one-man,&rsquo; but he is also humane and has the capacity to accept the failures of his subordinates as his own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And in the case of Veryard, he is the type of person who discards incompetence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, I was exaggerating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t mean that he is cold-blooded or anything like that, but he is the type of person who only looks at the numbers and does not give preferential treatment to people who are unnecessary to the organization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such a top executive may contribute to the development of the organization, but that is not the kind of organization I am aiming for. I want the people who belong to the organization to experience the joy of being useful to others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the &lsquo;Four Nations Trade Federation&rsquo; being set up so far, there is no need to rush to expand the organization. Even if it&rsquo;s slow, I want this to become a trustworthy organization where one&rsquo;s fellow members can rely on one another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rapid growth tends to create dropouts. That&#39;s probably what would happen if Veryard took the top position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I told Myourmiles, politely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;I see, so that was Rimuru-sama&#39;s idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My fears may be unfounded. I don&#39;t mean to say that Veryard-san is a bad person, but I think he tends to put efficiency first because he is capable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I can&#39;t deny that. So, my role is to make it easier for the people under Veryard-dono to work, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re quick to guess. The top position can be a decoration. But it shouldn&#39;t be empty. If you can be a portable shrine that everyone feels good about carrying, most things will work out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is not absolutely correct, because it is a case-by-case basis. But in this case, I was convinced that Myourmiles was the right choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, Myourmiles was also the minister of finance in our country, so he should not work too hard as the representative of the &ldquo;Four Nations Trade Federation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He should just reign at the top and assign tasks to his capable subordinates. And it seemed to me that Veryard was better suited to work for someone else than to be at the top himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, I gave my seal of approval to Myourmiles as a suitable representative, but upon hearing that, Myourmiles started laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahaha! As expected of Rimuru-sama, so very humble!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You idiot! I&#39;m not talking about me, I&#39;m talking about you!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though I shouted, Myourmiles kept laughing for a while.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After listening to Myourmiles&rsquo; report, it was time for the party to start.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We have invited noblemen from all over the world today, so Rimuru-sama will be the center of attention. There will be so many guests that you won&#39;t have time to take a break, what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmm, that&rsquo;s right&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s not good for me to be intimidating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Needless to say, it was a bad idea, and I also didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that was the case, I shouldn&#39;t have joined the party in the first place, but today&#39;s party would include Gazel, Youm, and King Drum of the Blumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the representatives of the four countries is Myourmiles, then they are the ones who are the big supporters. We can&#39;t afford not to show our faces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shall I get rid of them myself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Souei said so, but with a straight face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My instincts told me it would be a bloody scourge if I left it to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;N-no, it&rsquo;s okay. With my brilliant interpersonal skills, I&#39;ll be able to handle it just fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see&hellip;I understand. Then, I&#39;ll be escorting Rimuru-sama from a short distance away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Okay, that&#39;s a relief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time, violence was strictly forbidden since the group was full of high-ranking people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It doesn&#39;t have to be the bigwigs, but if it became an international issue, it wouldn&rsquo;t be just about us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lord, I am here too, so do not worry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ranga emerged from the shadows, asserting himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I&#39;m counting on you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Love that guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ranga&#39;s gesture soothed me, and my tension was eased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Riding on that momentum, I went to the venue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ninth floor, one floor below, has a large floor plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is designed to be used for various purposes, such as holding meetings with a large number of people, gathering the staff for events, and so on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And now, the space has been decorated and turned into a party venue with standing tables.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the way, the eighth floor is a cafeteria for the staff, where one can enjoy a meal while looking at the scenery. Coffee and tea are also available outside of mealtimes, so that business meetings and discussions can be held there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The food served at the party was, of course, prepared by our chefs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Assorted pickles, various soups, prosciutto, high-grade steaks, meatballs and roast beef, various pastas, takoyaki, yakisoba, okonomiyaki, curry and rice, hamburgers&hellip;huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no ramen, of course, but there was a lot of stuff on the menu that wouldn&#39;t normally be appropriate for a party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;M-Myourmiles-kun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t this a weird choice of food?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so? This is the most popular menu from the Monster Kingdom&#39;s cafeteria.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, well yeah, it is, but&hellip;huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, calm down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Perhaps we should&#39;ve made the menu more aristocratic, but there is no need to be bound by convention, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As long as we have the spirit to bring about a new wind, these menus may be the right choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the first place, we offered unusual cuisine at the Founding Festival. Rather, some people seemed to be expecting this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, no problem then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I won&#39;t complain even if there is a problem!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmm! I like your roughness, Myourmiles-kun. I regretted that I was overthinking things and looked around again to see if there were any other problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then my eyes met with the man who was in charge of setting up the venue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Veryard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, well, Your Majesty Rimuru! Oh, yes, in my current position, would it be acceptable if I called you Rimuru-sama?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He greeted me with a smiling face, and I nodded my head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was nothing wrong with it, but I had bitter memories of Veryard&#39;s smile, so I couldn&#39;t help but be overly cautious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is really no laughing matter for Myourmiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, I think the Blumund Kingdom was more unusual in that it flexibly changed the national system itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would normally be unthinkable in the real-life world, and even if it were an absolute monarchy, it would be a dream to achieve it without bloodshed. The fact that King Drum accomplished it showed me that he was no ordinary person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was a genuine gambler, using his own country as a chip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To be honest, I don&#39;t have such courage, so I can only respect him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As King Drum&rsquo;s sword, Veryard was not to be underestimated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Today&#39;s arrangements seem to be very careful and thorough, and I feel comfortable entrusting them to Veryard-dono. Please continue to support Myourmiles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. Also, please just call me Veryard. My father is the patriarch of my family, which used to be the marquis family, but I plan to throw it away without inheriting it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh&mdash;is that so!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, the status of the nobility will be shaken in the future, but that&#39;s only for the lower nobility. The Count status is doubtful, but I think the higher nobility of the Marquis family and above will be safe no matter what the situation is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Well, it is certain that we will change our name from aristocrats to noblemen</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt88" id="ftnt_ref88">[88]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and eventually lose power. After all, I&#39;m the one who proposed this to the Drum King.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So it&rsquo;s you!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I should be commended for swallowing those words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, what, it&#39;s just the way of the times. Right now, the aristocracy is running the government, but if the people get wise, they will be dissatisfied with the current situation. We need to gradually transfer the authority to them so that when that happens, they won&#39;t be hostile.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s true, but if you&#39;ve never been in politics before, you can&#39;t run a country all of a sudden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I replied, and Veryard smirked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to become a commoner now and accept the authority that will be transferred to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, you mean&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not cheating, it&#39;s a race.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But I understand it&#39;s very logical.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That strategy would certainly minimize complaints from the aristocracy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But really, just how far ahead is this guy moving?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As far as I can tell, he&#39;s as smart as anyone else. So much so that I&#39;m afraid to call him out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myourmiles was also shaking his head, as if stunned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I told you so, didn&#39;t I?&rsquo;&mdash;His eyes seemed to tell me, and I nodded my head in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The party started in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">First, Myourmiles, the representative of the party, greeted the guests, and then King Drum made a toast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then the lectures began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The important thing here is realizing that it is no good to be rude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t need to explain. There are royalty here, so of course it&#39;s wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, there are always people who can&rsquo;t read the atmosphere, and as soon as we started chatting, a crowd formed around me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even my brilliant interpersonal skills had their limits!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s one thing being surrounded by one or two people, but it&rsquo;s troublesome if I&#39;m surrounded by more than ten people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your Majesty Rimuru! Please listen to what I have to say!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We, too, would like to send a diplomat to your country!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We want to trade with you!

It was all giving me a headache. I can&#39;t ignore them, but they are really troublesome to deal with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was beyond my imagination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I guess that just shows how important my position has become, but it&#39;s also probably because I was careless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because Gazel isn&rsquo;t being crowded like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Youm is proudly&mdash;Wait no. Is that Myuran guarding you with a smiling face?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m jealous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, in Youm&#39;s case, he was a sharp-eyed warrior, so I suppose that&#39;s why a refined aristocrat wouldn&#39;t want to get close to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, I wonder if El-tan rarely showed herself because she didn&rsquo;t want to get involved in such a commotion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had said that she has them wait for a turn to see her after going through the formalities, so that she won&rsquo;t see them without an appointment. I decided I&#39;d do the same from now on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, my first priority now was to deal with this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I was pondering what to do, an unexpected person came to my rescue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why don&#39;t you all calm down a bit?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Gabbana, who had interfered with me the first time we met.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;His Majesty Rimuru is the demon lord of the great Jura-Tempest Federation, and our greatest supporter. I understand your desperation, but I ask that you refrain yourselves today!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabbana glared at them with a silent pressure, saying &ldquo;Today is a celebration of new beginnings, so we can discuss business at another time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man who had cried in front of me earlier was now very reliable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then there was the reaction of the guests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;W-Well, well, Gabbana-dono! I&#39;ve heard that you&#39;ve become a member of the &lsquo;federation,&rsquo; and I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re doing well&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tha-That&rsquo;s right, I was a bit impatient. It wasn&rsquo;t for nothing if I was able to greet you today, so if you&rsquo;ll excuse me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry too. I hope we can meet again at a later date through the formal procedure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Those who say this and walk away are still better, but most of them run away as quickly as possible. It wasn&rsquo;t a complimentary attitude, but I didn&#39;t want to make a scene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, my availability is limited, so Rigurd is the one in charge. Since I only meet with carefully selected people here and there, I&rsquo;m always sifting through a lot of people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the future, I plan to follow El-tan&#39;s example and be more strict so that I can try to avoid meeting with troublesome people as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, it&rsquo;s possible that I may never see these people again. With that in mind, I didn&#39;t mind a little rudeness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Still, I was impressed with Gabbana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gabbana was keeping a close eye on me at a distance. Thanks to him, I was able to enjoy the party calmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that I was free to move around, I looked around at the other guests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had already made arrangements with Gazel and Youm in advance, so there was no need to go out of my way to greet them. They would be present at the meeting tomorrow, so if they had anything important to say, they could say it there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today, I just have to broaden my knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to make small talk with people I&#39;m interested in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I looked around for someone, and there she was!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She&#39;s so beautiful that everyone was turning to look at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Who is it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, it&#39;s Hinata!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata was wearing a dress with the back wide open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was jet-black like a dark night, and studded with jewels like stars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it is not the dress that was noteworthy, but Hinata&#39;s own sexiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata&#39;s hair is short, so the bare skin from the nape of her neck to her waist is fully visible. A ribbon was tied around her neck, but even that accentuated Hinata&#39;s sex appeal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A black and white drawing of a group of people playing instruments

I don&#39;t know who thought of it, but it&#39;s a wonderful design.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m saving it in my brain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, I&#39;d rather have Ciel-san record this video&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;There is no such function&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, no, there is, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You showed me the information inside the labyrinth with vivid images.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;This is not inside the labyrinth, so the recorded images are inaccessible&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You&#39;re joking, right!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can definitely do it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You were even saving the battle records of the labyrinth monsters for us to review later. It&#39;s the same thing, just a little more&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;Negative.

You&#39;re such an unreliable partner at these critical moments, seriously.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It couldn&rsquo;t be helped, so I asked my slime cells to do their best, and spoke to Hinata with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Hinata-san. You look beautiful again today. That dress looks really good on you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata was sipping her wine, put it on the table and turned to me. Then she opened her mouth, her gaze sharp and suspicious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? You&#39;re a flatterer now, aren&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&#39;m not! I&#39;m serious. It&rsquo;s not flattery!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not very good at complimenting people on things I don&#39;t mean, so I&#39;m being half truthful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet, Hinata snickered and didn&#39;t take it seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t let the conversation end there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thinking that way, I desperately tried to repeat myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyway, you really are bold. I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but I didn&#39;t think Hinata would wear a dress that aggressive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She glared at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I gulped and swallowed the rest of my words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Uh-oh. I feel like I&#39;m becoming less and less likable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you think it&#39;s rude, then maybe you shouldn&#39;t say it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re right!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I shouldn&#39;t have crossed her. An apology was the only option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata&#39;s eyes glazed over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m getting impatient.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s when I sensed the aroma of wine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata&#39;s sigh was endlessly sexy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The back view was also sexy, but the front view was already nosebleed-inducing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dress was neck-length, but sleeveless, so there was nothing to hide her white shoulders. And most importantly, from side to side&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you looking at? I&rsquo;m gonna kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Failure, a failure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I forgot I was in human form and stared at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, they&rsquo;d know by looking at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m just grateful my body can&rsquo;t have nosebleeds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruminas insisted I wear this,&rdquo; Hinata said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nice work, Ruminas!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;d like to give you a big thumbs up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can picture Ruminas with a smug look on her face, and I respect her for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While inwardly leaping to praise Ruminas, I kept a cool expression on my face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, you&#39;re right. Ruminas is right. Because you really look beautiful today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I say so with a crisp expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am not afraid of Hinata&#39;s stare because I really mean it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s a lie. The truth is, I was really scared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not that again&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Covering Hinata&#39;s dumbfounded words with my lips&mdash;it would have been perfect if I could have imitated something like that, but one wrong move and it wouldn&#39;t have been sexual harassment. I&#39;d be a sexual predator, and I&#39;m a chicken-hearted person, so I didn&#39;t have the courage to go that far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why I told her in sincere words, &ldquo;It&#39;s true!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then I saw Hinata&#39;s cheeks turn red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I got this!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m the best today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;It&rsquo;s only because she&rsquo;s drunk&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;Hm?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I turned my attention to the wine that Hinata was drinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Isn&#39;t this a bit high in alcohol?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so? It&#39;s really good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Does Hinata have a surprisingly low tolerance for alcohol?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She doesn&#39;t look like it, but that&#39;s what Ciel-san says&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve always been interested in her sex appeal, so I wanted to know how she was doing in that area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I held up three fingers and asked Hinata.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How many fingers am I holding up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think I&#39;m stupid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, I&rsquo;d never do that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I hurriedly denied it, Hinata let out a big sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, I&#39;m still a Saint, right? I&#39;ve traveled with Chloe, and Ruminas has taught me a lot since I came back to life, so I can detoxify alcohol if I want to!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Can it be that you tricked me, Ciel-san!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s just say that after that, it was very difficult to calm down the angry Hinata.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, time went by without me having time to ask why Hinata&#39;s cheeks were so red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was the day after the party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After the lunch break, the meeting began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The participants&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first five were the rulers of the countries supporting the Four Nations&mdash;myself, Gazel, Youm, Myuran, and King Drum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All of us had already reached a consensus regarding this topic, so this time, we&rsquo;d only be participating for approval.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Next was Myourmiles, who was nominated as a representative by the four of us excluding Myuran, and Hinata who was representing the Western Saints Church.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From the Western States Council, there was the chairman himself. I think his name was Lester. As always, he had a bushy white beard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rest were carefully selected members from various countries, about thirty total, all gathered in the conference room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Veryard also participated as a secretary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cien stepped forward as the moderator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for taking time out of your busy schedules to join us here today. Well then, let us begin at once. Allow me to start by explaining the crisis that will occur in the near future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And with that, Cien began his explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The purpose of today&#39;s meeting is exactly what Myourmiles wanted to hear yesterday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The existence of a definite enemy and their goals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The anticipated effects of the war and how we should deal with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The participants were carefully selected in order to avoid fear due to panicking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No amount of crying or screaming would change the reality, so we needed to take optimal action as much as possible. In order to do this, the leader must never be flustered, but that was easier said than done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So first, let&rsquo;s move on to the explanation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have given the same explanation many times, so I was grateful to Myourmiles for arranging this occasion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cien&#39;s explanation ended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;And so, Demon Lord Rimuru-sama has won the war against the Empire, but a new enemy, Michael, has emerged.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chancellor Lester muttered, followed by the senators from the various countries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And this Michael is leading the angels?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s the Tenma Great War. I didn&#39;t think the 500-year cycle of disasters would happen in during lifetime&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hearing that, I decided to add something to the conversation to avoid any misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I raised my hand to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, as I&rsquo;ve just explained, the enemy&#39;s goal is to revive Veldanava. We can only speculate on the method, not prove it. And most importantly, we don&#39;t know exactly when. We think it will be soon, but Michael is a long-lived species. It could be tomorrow, it could be in a few years, and it could even be in a few decades.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was the most troubling part.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We didn&rsquo;t know when it would happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the time being, if there was any movement, we would know it from Dino&#39;s daily report. The accuracy of that information would be shared with Obera via Milim for confirmation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So far, Michael had not moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was eerie, but there was nothing we could do about it, so we left it alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, it was important to keep vigilance against the enemy who may attack at any moment, but we would still have to continue our daily activities&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been the same in Japan. The rate of occurrence of a major subduction zone earthquake within 10 years was 60 percent, and within 30 years it was as high as 99 percent, but that was just how we lived our daily lives.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In order not to be troubled when something happens, we should prepare in advance. Then, we should cherish our daily lives, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, I was more afraid of volcanoes than earthquakes, but that&#39;s because they were natural disasters that were impossible to deal with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was said that if a huge caldera eruption occurred on Mount Aso, it would have caused catastrophic damage. It was also called a catastrophic eruption, and there would have been no escape from it in Japan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some parts of Hokkaido might have been safe, but there was no doubt that Japan would be destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was a hypothetical story&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if it was predicted, and the government had said that it would happen within a year, it would still be doubtful&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be doubtful that it would actually happen, and there would be no escape plan even if one wanted to believe it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no country that would accept all of Japan&rsquo;s citizens, and it was also doubtful that people could escape to other countries one by one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, if the prediction were 100% certain, the government would do everything they can, but if the political system was different, it was unlikely to be accepted, and in the end, only those who can rely on their own contacts would be able to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I also think that somewhere in the back of my mind, there was the thought that &lsquo;if something happens, then we&#39;ll talk about it when it happens.&rsquo; It was better to live happily every day rather than to worry too much and live in fear every day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It doesn&#39;t mean that the place you escape to would be absolutely safe, but I guess you could think of it as a natural disaster because there&#39;s no point in thinking of it otherwise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is a saying, &ldquo;Do your best and wait for your destiny,&rdquo; meaning that it is better to do the best you can in the moment to live like a human being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Therefore, I want people to cherish their daily lives while preparing for Michael&#39;s attack at any time. That is why I only want the leadership to know about this fact. I hope you will cooperate with us with that in mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I concluded my remarks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone was silent as I spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some of them groaned loudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After tens of seconds had passed without anyone speaking, Hinata broke the silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The &nbsp;Western Saints Church pledges its full support.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata&#39;s statement was followed by Chancellor Lester.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that makes sense. The development plans being hurriedly carried out by the Western nations were preparations for that, weren&#39;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cien nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is correct. Everything is as Rimuru-sama wills it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition to laying the rails for the &lsquo;magic train,&rsquo; the construction of the e station building was also underway. The station was then expanded to provide an evacuation site for the residents of the surrounding area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">During normal times, the building could be used as a gymnasium, an auditorium, or for various other purposes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was going use this occasion to ask them to hold evacuations drill for the local residents. But before I could say anything else, Chairman Lester spoke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The important thing is to prepare in advance, which makes sense. I understand. I personally do not have the authority to interfere in the policies of other countries, but I can suggest evacuation drills as a possible solution. I&#39;d be happy to help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed. I am only a member of the council, but back home I am a marquis. I will advise the king and have my people trained.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s very good. I will cooperate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The councilors also agreed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was much quicker than I expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was probably because they had been carefully selected and there were no fools who would argue here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or rather, Myourmiles said that the meeting would be held in a small group so that this would happen. The reason is that a large group of people would not be able to reach a consensus on such an important decision. The idea was to persuade a small group of powerful people first, and then let the remaining members persuade the others individually.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It can be said that his plan was successful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Still, it was unclear how the council would vote on this, but about that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hohoho. Your Majesty Rimuru seems to be worried about the council&#39;s decision, but you can rest assured, because there is no one who can stand against Testarossa-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, that is true. Your life is more important than your own interests. Whether it&#39;s a matter of life and death for your country, or if it&#39;s a matter of whether or not to train your people to evacuate, you should obey the voice of Testarossa-dono.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Correct. This is not a matter I want to fight to get my opinion across.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Since this is beneficial to us as well, I think it will pass unanimously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reaction of the senators was not what Myourmiles and I had expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It almost felt like there was no need to be cautious explain in advance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess I was wrong about that, too. I&#39;ve never met her, but Testarossa seems to be quite the remarkable person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Veryard was impressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The eyes of the senators looking at Veryard were warm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t know if they were being kind, or envious&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, aren&#39;t you all a little too careless? I am Testarossa-sama&#39;s loyal servant, despite my appearance. I am obligated to report on this meeting, so please do not forget that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cien was the one who interrupted, but when the senators heard him, they fell into a panic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s a misunderstanding! Please believe me!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t mean any disrespect, I was just praising her leadership&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m telling the truth&mdash;Oh! Ahh! Glory to Testarossa-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know what to say about the last guy, but his emotions and desperation were palpable. I hadn&#39;t expected Testarossa to be feared so much, so I was surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cien, stop bullying everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I said, rebuking the laughing Cien.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And it seems that Veryard had also realized Testarossa&#39;s menace with just this exchange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, I thought we should meet once, but Testarossa-dono seems to be busy, so let&#39;s not. So, are we done with the meeting for today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And just like that, he moved aside without stepping into the minefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His ability to foresee danger was something to learn from, and I acknowledged Veryard&#39;s excellence once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The meeting was over, but I remembered that I had one more thing to tell everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yes. I heard from Testarossa that Masayuki, who became the Emperor of the East, wants to establish a cooperative relationship with the West. He wants to join the Western States Council, so what do you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was reported on the &#39;Telepathy Net&#39; just before I came here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I told them in a light-hearted way, but most of them stopped moving as if in shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&mdash;Wha?&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They all turned to look at me, their eyes wide open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only ones who weren&rsquo;t surprised were Gazel, Youm, Myourmiles, and Cien, whom I had explained to beforehand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hadn&#39;t even told King Drum yet, and he was just as shocked as Veryard. It&rsquo;s a secret, but I was a little satisfied to see his surprised face, which was so rarely seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it seems that what I said was a bigger bomb than I had thought it would be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t hear about that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I just told you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you know, King Gazel?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm, I was consulted, but I haven&rsquo;t heard any details. I didn&#39;t even know they were that far along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, so Gazel knew?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&laquo;No, we have discussed the hopes for that to happen, but haven&rsquo;t talked about any specifics, including dates and times&raquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That may have been the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a bit of a timing lapse, but since I have a cell phone, I probably should have told him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was going to meet him today anyway, so I had thought I&#39;d explain it there. But it wasn&rsquo;t convenient, so I just decided to announce it here and now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Youm didn&#39;t know about it either, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t hear about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then why aren&#39;t you surprised?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh. If I became surprised every time the Boss did something like this, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I feel like I was just dissed in a grand way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Myuran, who was listening beside him, put her hand on his head, but she didn&#39;t say anything, so I guess she must have agreed with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, the stares coming everyone are a little painful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m appalled. Why do you always have to talk about important things as if they&#39;re nothing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata&#39;s stare was painful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We-Well, even if you say that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I couldn&#39;t help but use honorifics</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt89" id="ftnt_ref89">[89]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Could it be that this was my fault?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had been so preoccupied with the battle against Michael that I thought it was only natural for the Empire to take a cooperative stance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We had been supporting them so that they&rsquo;d be in line with us. I didn&#39;t expect everyone to be this surprised, because it was only natural for this to happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&#39;t seem to be remorseful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guah!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait a minute, Hinata-san! You knew that our country and the Empire were at war, right? We won, so we exercised our rights as the victorious nation and decided to cooperate from now on. That would inevitably lead cooperation with the West!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I blurted out my excuses in a spirited manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Hinata&#39;s eyes did not stop staring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not wrong, but I might have made a mistake in not telling them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t have any means of communication, and saying &ldquo;I was busy&rdquo; was no excuse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, I was at fault, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was about to give an apology&mdash;but suddenly, Veryard nodded deeply and offered me a helping hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are quite right. This is not His Majesty Rimuru&rsquo;s fault, but rather ours for not asking for the details.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You understand, you do understand, Veryard-kun!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As expected of the smartest man I know, I couldn&#39;t ask for a better ally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata and Veryard glare at each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hinata is the one who breaks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yes.

He said he would like to attend the next council meeting if possible, as soon as possible. And to answer your second question, Lester, you are correct. My friend, Chosen Hero Masayuki, was recently crowned as Emperor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as I said that, the conference room erupted in applause.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s great! As expected of Masayuki-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, how wonderful! Now we can avoid war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know how this is possible, but I guess anything is possible with Masayuki-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re right! Even the Evil Empire was not an enemy of Masayuki-sama!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And all hell broke loose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I had heard of the coronation of the new Emperor, but I had no idea it was Masayuki-dono&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Chancellor Lester was in tears, but this reaction was unexpected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Somehow, I think I&#39;ve done Masayuki a disservice&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s no such thing as a space opera story where a Chosen Hero overthrows the Empire!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, if you think about it normally, it&#39;s impossible for an individual to overthrow a country. The fact that they can believe that such a thing has taken place shows that they have a ridiculous amount of faith in Masayuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But now that it&#39;s happened, there&#39;s nothing I can do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&#39;s the way it is. I don&#39;t know the details, so you&#39;ll have to ask him yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that said, I threw all the trouble onto Masayuki, who knew nothing about the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this way, the plan to implement the evacuation drills was shared, and it was decided that the new Emperor of the Eastern Empire would be present at the next council meeting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;So that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve spent the last five months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There have been a few small mistakes, but the preparations have proceeded steadily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next council meeting is scheduled for two weeks from now in Ingracia, and the consensus between Masayuki and the council leaders is sound. In effect, the Empire&#39;s accession is expected to be approved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was safe to say that Testarossa would take care of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the surface, the unification of humanity has been achieved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The demon lord&#39;s forces are well prepared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now, we just have to hope that the enemy&#39;s strength is not greater than expected&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I was thinking this, I suddenly received a call from Dino.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s Dino, can you hear me?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Of course I can. So, has there been any movement?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t in the morning, so I&#39;m pretty sure something had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hmm, I&#39;d say there was, so I&#39;ll keep in touch for the time being. But there are so many things to say, and it&#39;s difficult to decide where to start&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was talking in an incomprehensible manner, but I was sure that something had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The peaceful daily life came to an end as soon as I heard the news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c17"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c11">Chapter 3<br></span><span>Reminiscences of the Clowns</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Going back in time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, who was taken from the battlefield by Feldway, regained consciousness just as Lieutenant Kondou was killed in battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was the result of being freed from control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the current location was a different world that Kagali had no knowledge of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">What&#39;s going on?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali tried to grasp the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then she saw a familiar face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dino&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!

I guess that Kondou guy is dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You, you noticed&hellip;I see, so the boss told you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was surprised to hear Dino call her by a name she had abandoned, but her gaze wandered to where she found Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was sitting comfortably in his chair, but his expression was blank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, like Kagali had been, Yuuki was under the control of someone. Kagali instantly realized that it would not be surprising if Yuuki had revealed her true identity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well. I don&#39;t know much about what happened to you, but to be honest, I&#39;m more interested in that appearance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino said as such, looking at the current Kagali, who looked nothing like Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">He&rsquo;s still so aloof and unpredictable as always</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali thought while releasing her tension.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Actually, Kagali did not have enough fighting ability now. She may be above A rank, but in the eyes of the real monsters, she is a small fry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s ability was unknown, but it was obvious that she was no match for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, Kagali thought of the best move she could make at the moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, she was gathering information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, where are we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino replied in a cryptic manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you notice we&rsquo;re in another world? This is a special place, the place of beginnings, adjacent to all worlds but isolated from them as well&mdash;the &lsquo;Heavenly Star Palace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The name was unfamiliar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it was filled with words of great importance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">The place of beginnings&hellip;No way, the birthplace of &lsquo;Star King Dragon&rsquo; Veldanava&mdash;!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The place of beginnings was said to have existed before the creation of all worlds. It was a folklore that could only be remembered in mythology.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was said to exist, but no one had ever even seen it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To get here, you need a &lsquo;key&rsquo; to go through the gate, but I didn&#39;t know what it was. But now that I&rsquo;ve been brought here, I understand. I&#39;m not going to tell you, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was annoyed but remembered that Dino was a man who did not like to waste time. If he wouldn&rsquo;t tell her now, then he wouldn&rsquo;t tell her anything, no matter what she did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, all she had to do was ask something else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&#39;t force you, so just answer what you can tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;How troublesome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;ve known each other a long time, isn&rsquo;t it fine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Che, what&#39;s in it for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I remember doing a lot of work for you, so&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Kagali could finish, Dino straightened up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you want to know? If I ask you that, you&#39;ll forget about the past, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, of course I will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali smiled at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino was still the same. Kagali was relieved to see that, despite the incomprehensible situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our boss&mdash;Yuuki Kagurazaka, why is he still under control? You just said that Kondou is dead&mdash;No way!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re really quick to guess, aren&#39;t you? I know you&#39;re probably right, so there&#39;s no point in saying it, but I&#39;ll tell you. You were dominated by Kondou, but Yuuki is being controlled by the same person who lent Kondou the power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As I thought&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was an unbelievable fact that she didn&#39;t want to believe&mdash;that there was an entity that could lend someone the power to control others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Dino wouldn&#39;t lie like this. He was the type of person who didn&rsquo;t talk if he didn&rsquo;t want to, so his information was more truthful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki is being controlled&mdash;he has a very specific constitution that nullifies all skills, but the fact the someone has the power to break through it is scary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She wanted to get Yuuki back to normal in order to escape from this place, but had no idea how to do that. In that case&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are my cute children?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You mean the ones standing behind you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali turned around in a panic. There was no sign of them, but that was to be expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I see, so you&rsquo;ve become combat dolls (killing mode), that just follow my orders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali warned herself that she seemed to be in a hurry even though she thought she was calm. Then, she released the order and returned Tear and Footman to their former selves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, there were also nine unfamiliar undead elves standing in the line, but those were none of Kagali&#39;s concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;For the time being, she had a vague memory of the time when she was under control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She remembers being ordered to use the forbidden spell &ldquo;Demon Death Birthday,&rdquo; so they must have been created by that. However, it was not Kagali&#39;s will, and she had no attachment to those she created.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Chairman! So you&rsquo;re all right! I was so worried about you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hooohohoho. Tear is right. Chairman, did the boss help you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, he didn&#39;t. There&rsquo;s no point in hiding it, so I&#39;ll tell you right now&mdash;this situation is the worst.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali said so informing them of the current situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino didn&#39;t care that he was being ignored and fell asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, it&#39;s because we&rsquo;re not good enough, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s not true, Tear. Even the boss was dominated, so I&#39;m sure we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist no matter how much we struggled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then what are you going to do? Are you going to obey?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Since there are no guards, can&#39;t we escape?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footman asks and Tear gives her opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s expression is dark as she answers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s the problem. As much as I&rsquo;d like to escape, we&#39;re talking about the &lsquo;Heavenly Star Palace&rsquo; which is in another world. You can&#39;t escape using magic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Actually, Kagali had already tried the elemental magic: &lsquo;Warp Portal.&rsquo; If there had been any sign of success, she had intended to take Tear, Footman, and Yuuki and escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, since the coordinates of the current location were unknown, the spell did not work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">It was fortunate that I was able to break out of the control, but it was clear to them that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do anything with just that anyways&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a shame, but that&rsquo;s the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sure, there were no guards, but that was only because Kagali and the others were believed to be unable to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dino.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh, oh. What, just when people are about to take a nice nap. You still have questions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t suppose you could answer them, but is there any way we can get out of here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think there is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right? I&#39;ve always appreciated your quick thinking. So you&#39;d better stop wasting your time and keep quiet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The result was as expected, but still a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The &lsquo;Heavenly Star Palace&rsquo; is a very small flat world. It exists within the inner surface of a sphere, with the lower half being the earth and the upper half being the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is less than a hundred square kilometers in size, has only a temperate climate with no four seasons, and includes a beautiful chalk castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But that was perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The flowers did not wither, the fruit did not rot, the water was clean, and the earth was moist. Therefore, there were always fields of flowers in full bloom, and the sparse trees bore sweet and fragrant heavenly fruits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this world where time seemed to have stopped, there was no sense of change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali and the others were waiting in the garden in a gazebo. From there, they could see the whole castle and, on the other side, the huge gate at the edge of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no sign of anyone coming out of the castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But with the gates closed, it seemed clear that escape from this world was impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, Kagali was not discouraged by Dino&#39;s answer and instead tried to calmly think of a countermeasure. However, someone came out of the castle to interrupt her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was a man with a muscular physique and a fearless face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He seemed to be emitting a gushing spirit from his body, which indicated that he was very strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dino-sama, I am troubled. How can a man of your stature be so friendly to such a group of people?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man looked down on Kagali and the others in a very natural manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was annoyed by this person but put up with it for the time being. She had a cautious personality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gnome, wasn&rsquo;t it? From the looks of it, it seems you&#39;ve successfully incarnated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! The body of a man named Vega was a very good catalyst. His regenerative powers are high, and at this rate, I&#39;m sure the others and Dhalis-sama will be able to incarnate as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s good to know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino replied, looking uninterested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, unaware of the situation, listened to the conversation in silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega was definitely the &lsquo;Vega of Power,&rsquo; one of the heads (leaders) of Cerberus. In Kagali&#39;s vague memory, there was a scene of them coming to this place together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Vega as a catalyst? Perhaps as a substitute for incarnation? No, that&rsquo;s certainly possible. That man inherited the blood one of Rosso&#39;s research achievmentts, &lsquo;Magic Inquisitor.&rsquo; He is both monster and human, and can recover from any injury as long as he&#39;s fed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, he would regenerate even if its arms were cut off, and in fact, there was even an experimental result that had shown that he would revive as long as his head was left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is where the horrifying part came in&mdash;even the parts of the body that had been cut off would attempt to return to human form as a monster with no sense of self.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was why Yuki had strictly ordered Vega to collect his limbs if they were ever cut off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that this Gnome guy took advantage of Vega&#39;s traits to obtain a hollow body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Why did he need a body in the first place? What is his true identity? Does it mean he needs to incarnate, like a demon? No, judging from this divine presence, he&rsquo;s an angel. That would certainly be more powerful than possessing a human or a monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali thinks fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She&#39;s lost most of her fighting ability, but her mind is still intact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And she had come to a rough conclusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This man, Gnome, is an angel&mdash;or some kind of spiritual life form. And he incarnated in order to invade the earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega is being used as a catalyst to create flesh. He may be alive, but he is not in a position to move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was mostly correct, except that Gnome&#39;s race was a phantom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had strengthened his pseudomorphic body with magicule by fusing them with Vega&#39;s cells. In this way, Gnome had succeeded in complete incarnation by incorporating the substance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The substances taken in were proteins and carbohydrates collected from the ground. In other words, all he had to do was eat. It was a different method from that of undead elf, but it was more convenient for Gnome, who was a semi-mental life form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the way, this Gnome is one of Zalario&#39;s subordinates. He had been left out of the attack on &nbsp;Ramiris&#39; labyrinth and had been staying at home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then Feldway returned with Vega and the others, and ordered Gnome to incarnate. Zalario and his group returned in a timely manner and met with Dino and the rest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the success of Gnome as an experiment, the others began to incarnate. That is why Gnome was the first one to come out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gnome, a former Throne Angel, is now a high-ranking subordinate &ldquo;general&rdquo; level phantom. Because of his successful incarnation, he was now able to exert more power than the Demon Lord Seed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From Gnome&rsquo;s perspective, Kagali, who was almost the same as a human, was nothing more than a speck of dust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, naturally, he would speak as one who was superior to them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kagali, right? You&#39;re just tools to increase our strength. You seem to have regained your free will after the death of Kondou, who was more or less a useful tool, but don&#39;t get carried away. Dino-sama here is nothing like you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, stop it right there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, Dino-sama! Dino-sama is one of the great &lsquo;Seven Primordial Angels!&rsquo; It is too merciful of you to speak so casually with these people!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s why I&rsquo;m saying that Kazaream and I are old acquaintances.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Kagali now. Can you call me that from now on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;d say it&#39;s a pain in the ass to remember, but it&#39;s nice that the name has been shortened. All right, Kagali.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unlike her previous incarnation as a man, Kagali is now a beautiful woman. The name change didn&#39;t feel out of place, and Dino accepted it easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ignoring Gnome, Dino and Kagali continued their friendly conversation&hellip;but this irritated Gnome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gnome&#39;s master is a former cherub named Dhalis. A noble man with great fighting skills, he was Zalario&#39;s second-in-command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even Dhalis cannot match up to the supreme beings, the Primordials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They did not receive their names only recently, like Gnome did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were created and named by the god Veldanava himself. They were the great seraphim who had been destroying demons since the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To Gnome, they were like gods, and Kagali&#39;s attitude was unbearable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if Dino himself allowed it, it would affect Zalario&#39;s &lsquo;status&rsquo; if left unchecked. Thinking so, Gnome finally decided to use force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I told you not to get carried away!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He fired a mass of spiritual energy (Tenkoudan) at Kagali, who was sitting on a chair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino did not move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because he didn&#39;t have to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hooohohoho. Is the long story over? Even so, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s being rude to the Chairman!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, that&#39;s right! Do it, Footman!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s dear companions and loyal clowns are ready to take on Gnome&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle had become one-sided and fierce.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gnome was originally a phantom that had been at war with the insectars as a force under Zalario&#39;s command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although he had just gained a physical body, he did not feel any discomfort. On the contrary, his fighting ability had increased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His existence value exceeded one million. On top of that, in order to fill up his empty body, the magicule count was currently increasing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Against Gnome, who is in great shape, was Footman, who had a higher fighting ability than Clayman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His intelligence is low, but his power was unmatched. His existence value had reached 1.3 million, and now that the restriction had been lifted, his power was incomparable to when he had fought Geld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Boom!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footman punched Gnome while shouting this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gupaah!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gnome&#39;s face caved in, and he was blown away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hohoho. I&#39;m coming for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He chased after Gnome with no regard for him and hit and hit and hit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He grabbed Gnome&#39;s foot, swung him around and threw him into the air, causing Footman to also jump. He bounced back, gained momentum, and used his own body like a cannonball to plunge into Gnome&#39;s back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;GOBOO&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He then grabbed Gnome and slammed him into the ground. Footman&#39;s entire weight was also on top of Gnome&#39;s back, adding to the momentum crushing him into the earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although Footman is not very intelligent, he has a good sense of combat. If Gnome had gotten Vega&#39;s cells, he would regenerate after being torn or injured. He instinctively knew that such attacks were meaningless, so he fought by accumulating damage and depriving him of stamina.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gnome was puzzled by Footman, who was much stronger than he had imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">H-How can this be!? How can I, a phantom general, be inferior to this unknown person!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The incarnation had greatly increased his fighting ability, and yet, he was losing to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gnome was baffled by this fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What, what are you&mdash;!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? I&#39;m Footman. I&#39;m a Moderate Clown Troupe member, Footman the &lsquo;Angry Pierrot.&rsquo; Pleased to make your acquaintance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footman bowed condescendingly and announced his name politely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This relaxed attitude struck a nerve with Gnome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then there was Tear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll say my name too! I&#39;m Tear. Tear the &lsquo;Teardrop,&rsquo; of the Moderate Clown Troupe! After Footman, you&rsquo;ll have to play with me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was saying it in a cute way, but was not hiding her evil intentions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although not as powerful as Footman, Tear was also quite strong. Her existence value was a little over a million, and her Unique Skill was a vicious trump card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wouldn&rsquo;t work now. However, if Footman was defeated, then Tear would come into her own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Looking forward to that time, Tear continued to watch over Footman&#39;s battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once again, Footman&#39;s onslaught has begun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Punching, kicking, and slamming. Like a cat shaking a mouse, Footman is hunting down Gnome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gnome is getting impatient.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footman and Tear laugh at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, who was watching over them, was analyzing the situation calmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">It&rsquo;s the worst. There is no future for us if we continue like this. Even if we win this battle, Gnome seems to be a low-level member. We have Tear, but even that doesn&#39;t seem like it would help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali glanced at Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I don&#39;t think Tear can win against an opponent that Yuuki-sama couldn&rsquo;t defeat&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, angels and demons cannot be physically destroyed. Unless one uses a special skill, they will come back to life even if Gnome was killed here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as he took in Vega&#39;s cells, he became physically unable to die. Moreover, there was a high probability of resurrection even after death, so the battle itself seemed pointless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, defeat was guaranteed. Knowing this, Kagali felt like a fool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop it, Footman. That&rsquo;s enough playing around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? Are you sure, Chairman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. We can&#39;t escape from here anyway. Not unless we can destroy that big gate, but that seems impossible no matter what.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Dino&#39;s words were to be believed, then this was a closed-off world called the &lsquo;Heavenly Star Palace.&rsquo; They needed a key to get through the gate, and Kagali and the others had no way to obtain it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a dead end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seeing Kagali, Gnome laughed loudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah! Hahahaha! That&#39;s right. If you understand that much, then we can make this quick. All you have to do is work as hard as you can as a tool. If you do, I&#39;ll take good care of you as a capable subordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seeing that Footman had stopped moving, Gnome understood the situation. It was unexpected that he couldn&#39;t defeat Footman, but Kagali, his master, was clever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As long as he could control their master, Footman and Tear would be nothing but puppets. If so, Gnome&#39;s superiority would be preserved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thinking this, Gnome regained his composure, but the next moment, he was frightened by the overwhelming presence of death that surrounded him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How unsightly, Gnome. It was a mistake to give you a name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before he knew it, the great gate had opened, revealing three figures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of them, a striking beauty with long jet-black hair that looked as if it was studded with stars in the night sky, was Zalario, the leader of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A picture containing linedrawing

He was dismayed and disappointed by the fecklessness of the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His companions, Pico and Gracia, walked towards Dino, away from Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yo, good work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah.

Though I&rsquo;m not going to apologize for the trouble Gnome has caused you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was perplexed by the casualness of the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From Zalario&#39;s point of view, he was telling the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Lieutenant Kondou who had picked Kagali up, but it had been Feldway&#39;s decision. It was Feldway&#39;s will to use the power that Michael had given him to create bodies for incarnation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was successfully accomplished, and although there were only nine of them, they were wonderfully prepared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The transcendent beings, Zalario and the others, needed to select the bodies to incarnate. As with their current temporary bodies, mere humans and monsters would not be able to withstand their power and would disintegrate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was similar to the situation where primordials competed with each other for incarnation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that they could not easily manifest in the material world also made it difficult for them to carry out their invasion strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali conveniently existed in this situation, and the idea of using undead elves as an elementary body emerged. They had to try it out but could say that the result was good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The idea of using Vega had also been adopted as an alternative, but the result was Gnome running out of control, and Zalario judged it to be a failure because it seemed to affect his personality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In comparison, undead elves did not have free will. The power of an undead elf had been proven by Footman, and he judged that it would be enough to withstand Zalario&#39;s possession.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I reject the idea of using this Vega guy. Gnome was a more cautious man, but I can&#39;t help but think it would have had a strange effect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario muttered to no one in particular, but Kagali listened and thought about it. Then, without thinking, she opened her mouth to answer when she didn&#39;t have to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Vega is greedy. Befitting of a position that symbolized Power, he takes in every desire he can and makes it his own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hoh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; she thought, but it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Faced with the silent pressure to continue, she proceeded to state her reasoning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Vega is pure. He obeys the strong and eats the weak. He&#39;s a vile character, but he has his own beliefs. That&#39;s why he&#39;s strong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He doesn&#39;t take it personally when he loses, and he&#39;ll stoop to any level if he thinks he can&#39;t win. He believes that as long as he can survive and make it to the next level, he will win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is why Vega had never felt defeated. He believed that anyone who overlooked him was an idiot, and that he should pay them back one day when he is able to win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is how Kagali evaluated Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Although Yuuki-sama is superior in terms of greed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After seeing through Vega&#39;s character, he had made good use of it. Kagali also admired Yuuki&#39;s strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. So you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s possible that such a greedy nature has permeated every single cell of Vega?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, who had thought she hadn&#39;t explained it well enough, nodded at Zalario&#39;s accurate point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly. That&#39;s why I honestly don&#39;t recommend growing and using his cells.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario said, turning his attention back to the castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see&hellip;That thing is definitely useless. You follow me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite asking, Zalario was already quickly towards the castle. Gnome, whose presence had become scarce, naturally followed Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali wondered for a moment what to do, but then decided that it would not be wise to disobey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You two, follow me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali followed Zalario, taking Footman and Tear with her. Then, as if it were natural, Yuuki followed Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Only Dino and three others were left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This has nothing to do with us, so we can&rsquo;t do anything about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think that&#39;s the point. Pico, don&#39;t be too accommodating to Dino. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll be the one who gets in trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, come on, you&#39;re making it sound like I&#39;m no good, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re no good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re a bad angel. A fallen angel!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Idiot! You think you&rsquo;re so smart, shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such was the exchange between the three of them in the empty room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was impressed by the grandeur of the castle as she entered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The castle that she had given to Clayman was a reminder that she had not yet achieved the level of luxury she had hoped for. The royal castle she had lived in so long ago seemed so shabby compared to this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s wonderful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course it is. This castle is where Veldanava-sama resides.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not expecting a response, Kagali changed her opinion of Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that he is surprisingly conversant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While she was thinking about this, they arrived at their destination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a room with two large culture tanks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had the appearance of a laboratory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were five men and five women surrounding one of the culture tanks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Floating in the middle of them was something in the shape of a person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Upon closer inspection, it resembled Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Noticing Zalario&#39;s presence, everyone turned around and bowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A man greeted them on behalf of the group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Zalario-sama, welcome back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man&#39;s name was Dhalis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Strictly speaking, phantoms had no gender, but he was a confidant who had served Zalario as a man since the original cherub era.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario nodded lightly and told him the matter at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The plan is cancelled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dhalis didn&rsquo;t ask why. He believed that whatever Zalario said was right, and that they should just follow him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was the reason why the angelic ego was regarded as weak. That is why they were so easily influenced by the encroachment of Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have given you a name, but it may have been meaningless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, sir. Am I in any way at fault here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you are not at fault. It&#39;s just that I expected too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario would do his best, but he did not expect every result to be perfect. He was working to accurately evaluate the confirmed results and apply them to the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, no matter what the outcome, his emotions would not be shaken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dhalis was afraid Zalario&rsquo;s disappointment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, despite his regrets, he followed Zalario&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">He ordered his subordinates, Gnome and Berne</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt92" id="ftnt_ref92">[92]</a></sup><span class="c0">, to stop the incubator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Nice, who is the equal of Dhalis, had no objections and had her subordinates, Bem</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt93" id="ftnt_ref93">[93]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Sun, help her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Dhalis was male and Nice was female.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The others, like Gnome, were former throne angels, so they did not have a definite gender. However, as Zalario said, they had recently acquired &ldquo;names,&rdquo; and their personalities had become distinctive. This had given them their individuality, but it was still developing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that one of the subordinates of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders&rdquo; Cornu, who was the same rank as Zalario, was possessed by a native of the invaded area and lost the initiative. It is believed that this was due to a weak ego, and as a countermeasure, only the former angelic leaders were given names.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, several decades had passed since then, and Zalario believed that even then, the changes were so slight that no further growth could be expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was why he was looking for suitable mediums for possession.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">&mdash;I had thought the idea of cultivating Vega&#39;s body was a good one, but the cells themselves were covered with evil. In that case, there is no choice but to use the undead elves that were created&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were nine of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was enough for the current leaders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Feldway was planning to ask Michael to use the &#39;Army of Angels, Armageddon&#39; to further increase his strength. The plan was not to summon countless angels, but to concentrate his energy to create several pillars of seraphim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what the undead elves are for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s subordinates, even his confidant Dhalis, were only second in rank. The undead elf should have been used only for the seraphim, in order to gather a large and unshakable force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Oh well. We don&#39;t know how many pillars we can summon, so there&#39;s no rush. I&#39;ll talk to Feldway about this later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario thought about it and was about to leave the place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then, he heard the sound of shattering glass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The culture tank had been destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait! I&#39;ll never forgive you for ripping my arm off! It&rsquo;s you, I&#39;ll get it back!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the device shut down, Vega woke up and began to move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And his target was Gnome, who had fused with Vega&#39;s cells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gubuh, gugugu&mdash;gupah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before anyone could stop him, Vega&#39;s arm grabbed Gnome. Then the fusion began, and Gnome was absorbed by Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that&#39;s delicious! My power is getting stronger!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega was delighted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sensed that the Gnome guy he had absorbed had a huge amount of magicules, and that it had boosted his strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kukakakakaka! This guy is good. Now, I can take any bastard I want&mdash;Uh!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega&#39;s climax ended the moment he locked eyes with Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve heard a lot about you. You can either join us, or you can stay here and fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega was asked this question, but he already knew his answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Heh, sorry. I got carried away. Of course, I&#39;ll follow you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That kind of filthiness was quite impressive at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario was not dismayed, as this attitude was within expectations. He knew it, and accepted it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The loss of Gnome was unfortunate, but it did help to strengthen Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What was needed for the future battles was not an army, but individual heroes. The more powerful allies they had, the better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, Gnome had just lost his ego, so his value as a pawn had diminished. In fact, it was better for him to become Vega&#39;s ally here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario was cruel and ruthless to his subordinates who had served him since long ago, but that was just his true nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The others had no problem with it as long as it was Zalario&rsquo;s decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega&#39;s outburst was forgiven, and he was treated as one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, who was watching the whole thing, could not help but feel disgusted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega&#39;s attitude was horrible, but it was hard to understand what kind of thought process Zalario had, who had tolerated it so easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She couldn&#39;t read Zalario&#39;s thoughts because he didn&#39;t seem to be similar to Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki was well aware of the dangers of Vega and handled him well. But Zalario&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Zalario, on the other hand, probably doesn&rsquo;t even think Vega is dangerous. Does that mean he is that much more capable?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali judged that from the situation, she was correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario did not even care about the current Vega. Even his own subordinates were only slightly useful tools.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But this was not arrogance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not arrogance, because Zalario&#39;s perception was correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s nature of grasping information correctly was far from arrogance. Kagali, however, could not possibly understand such a thing, and was left confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Kagali, isn&rsquo;t it? And Yuuki wasn&rsquo;t like that either. Well, we&#39;re old friends, so let&#39;s get along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was noticed by Vega who called out to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There&#39;s no way that the current Kagali can beat Vega. Besides, even if Tear and Footman had challenged Vega, the odds would have been about 50-50. Since Yuuki was still deprived of his free will, she decided that it would be best to just stay in line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. Our circumstances have changed a lot, so let&#39;s continue to get along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. Anyway, where am I? Where are we?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s called the &lsquo;Heavenly Star Palace.&rsquo; It looks like there&#39;s no way to escape, so we&#39;ll just have to obey those people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. Well, I don&#39;t need to run away. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll need my help anyway, so I&#39;ll just enjoy the situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali envied Vega&#39;s simplicity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario didn&rsquo;t seem to like it, but the intentions of those controlling Yuuki were unknown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali thought that the Demon Death Birthday spell would be a trump card for her and the others, but she was not sure about that, either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, a ritual that required tens of thousands of corpses was not something that could be easily handled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">We need to make them think we&#39;re useful somehow. If worse comes to worst, we&#39;ll survive even if we have to flatter them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali thought as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was out of the question to abandon their ambitions after all this time. She had decided that now was the time for surrender, and was ready to throw away her pride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And that resolve would soon be put to the test.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael and Feldway had returned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the center of the castle, there was an audience hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no one on the throne. It had been empty for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chairs were arranged in the hall, and people were sitting as they pleased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael was seated in the chair closest to the throne. Standing next to him was Feldway, staring at the gathered people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition to Zalario and the others, Kagali&#39;s group was also there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino and his group came without skipping a beat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The newborn undead elves had also been brought there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And that wasn&rsquo;t all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera and her confidant from the Palace of Monsters had also been summoned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera had only one confidant, named Oma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The others were killed in the battle against the cryptids. As you can see from this, Obera is the one who was in charge of the toughest battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Oma had lost both her eyes when she became a youma</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt94" id="ftnt_ref94">[94]</a></sup><span class="c0">, but instead she had a single eye that could see everything. Her mouth had been sewn shut, and she communicated only by &lsquo;telepathy,&rsquo; not with words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite her eerie appearance, she was a former cherub and a veteran warrior who has followed Obera for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera and the others were not the only ones Feldway brought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was the Insectar, with whom he had fought for what seemed like an eternity, and with whom he was now in an alliance with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Insect Lord Zelanus, and the Twelve Insect Generals, who were his confidants, had gathered together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, there were only eight of them now, not twelve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the missing members was Razul, the guardian god of the West. He invaded the Cardinal World more than two thousand years ago under the command of Zelanus, but betrayed him and became an ally of the Chosen Hero Granbell. He was a bug-type majin (insectar) who had been defeated by Shion and Ranga.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The other was Minaza., who was sent by Zelanus to help Emperor Rudra after he was promised half the world. He had also been defeated by Shion, though by a strange coincidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There other two were escaped larvae born of the replacement. One of them was also a direct descendant of Zelanus, so a secret search order had been issued&hellip;It was still missing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each of the eight currently present, like Razul and Minaza, had a fighting ability comparable to that of an awakened demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Among them, Zess, a direct descendant of Zelanus and the commander of the bug-generals, boasted a strength that set him apart from the others. He was Zalario&#39;s rival, and they had competed with each other to the death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The strength of the remaining seven was on a par with the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beathop, who had the characteristics of a bee and a grasshopper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mujika, who looked like an anthropomorphic centipede.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tishorn who was like a mantis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Torun, a dragonfly with wings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Abart, with spider-like limbs on his back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Saril, a venomous scorpion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Peliod, beautiful as a damselfly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All of them with their own peculiarities were standing in silence, not even sitting on chairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a large room, but the oppressive feeling made it seem smaller.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was afraid, but decided to let things happen as they would.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After everyone had been assembled, the meeting with Michael began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gentlemen. With Rudra gone, Michael-sama is free. And as a first step towards Veldanava-sama&#39;s resurrection, we have succeeded in expelling Velgrynd. The plan is now&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, Zalario stepped forward to speak. Normally, he would not interrupt his superior Feldway, but this time he decided that it was urgent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Feldway-sama, please hold. It seems that there is a difference in perception.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway was in a good mood, but his smile disappeared at Zalario&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He became a little sullen and asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Velgrynd is alive and well. And because of her, Cornu has been destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&mdash;!?&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Zelanus twitched at this remark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway frowned in displeasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Demon Lord Rimuru was an annoying new interloper, but the plan had gone well. Guy Crimson and Rimuru Tempest would both be obstacles, but Veldanava&#39;s resurrection was still imminent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of the three remaining &ldquo;True Dragons&rdquo; on Earth, Velgrynd&#39;s dragon factor had been obtained, and he was ready to obtain the other two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, if Zalario&#39;s words were true, it meant that there would be a major deviation from the plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And, as if to confirm his words, Cornu&#39;s presence had disappeared. His presence was nowhere to be found, neither here at the &lsquo;Heavenly Star Palace,&rsquo; nor in the Palace of Monsters in the Otherworld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s true. Because of Cornu&#39;s disappearance, the plan failed. We had no choice but to retreat. I didn&#39;t think your plan would fail, but I guess the blame lies with your ineptitude, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Dino, not Zalario, who answered. Dino was more tactful than Zalario in that he even shifted the blame for the failure of the plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario tacitly accepted it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t think that Dino&#39;s opinion was correct, but he also didn&rsquo;t think it was necessary to deny it. Zalario, who was fair-minded and strict with himself, could be flexible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With such a reaction from both of them, Feldway had no choice but to stop doubting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unexpectedly, Feldway was in a foul mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, his mind was clear and he quickly devised a countermeasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first thing to do was to secure a &lsquo;True Dragon.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since the Dragon Factor was essential to Veldanava&#39;s resurrection, it was only natural that this would be the first priority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fortunately, Velgrynd&#39;s dragon factor had already been secured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although he hadn&#39;t expected to come back to this world, it wasn&#39;t the worst situation. Still, it was a rather painful mistake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I was careless. I retrieved the skill because it was going to disappear anyway, but as a result, the &ldquo;control circuit&rdquo; also disappeared. I banished her to the far side of time and space so that she would not be an enemy even ifs he resurrected, but now I have increased the number of troublesome enemies&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that time, Velgrynd had lost most of her power. On top of that, the Dragon Factor had been taken from her, and she was on the verge of disappearing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why Michael retrieved the &lsquo;Charity King (Raguel),&rsquo; but there was no way he could have predicted that this would lead to the destruction of Cornu.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Never mind. As long as Veldanava-sama is resurrected, the rest is not important. Let&#39;s leave the Velgrynd matter alone and have Velzard join us first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time, he would careful not to make her disappear, and let her join with some free will. This would help against Velgrynd, and would also help them capture Veldora.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once they had Velzard in the group, what would they do next?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had planned to go after Veldora right away, but now needed to reconsider this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">If we&#39;re going to be facing Velgrynd as well, we&#39;d better get our forces up to speed. I thought that Michael and I could handle it, but you can never be too careful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino had just told him that he wasn&rsquo;t thinking clearly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why Feldway decided to drastically change his original plan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In that case, it seems we need to take immediate action. Let&#39;s take Velzard in first. This time, let&rsquo;s not banish her to the far reaches of space-time and instead use her as an ally.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There is no other choice. It would be more prudent to eliminate as many uncertainties as possible and begin the final ritual once the three True Dragons have been captured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael nodded in agreement with Feldway&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Velzard was given the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Patience King (Gabriel)&rsquo; by Veldanava. In other words, since the &ldquo;Control Circuit&rdquo; was active, she could be added to the team safely and reliably.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The problem was what happened after that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael&#39;s eyes scanned over the group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t think it was necessary, but we should incarnate them all. That way, we can deal with whatever happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed. Let&#39;s leave Veldora for later and finish all possible preparations first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The conversation between Feldway and Michael progressed, and a conclusion was reached.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In anticipation of this, Zalario made a report.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;On that note, I have something to report.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The attempt to incarnate using Vega there has failed. The only surefire way is to possess the undead elf.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. So then nine people. It&#39;s a little difficult to decide who to incarnate&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Feldway pondered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here&#39;s what Zelanus had to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do what you want with those undead elves. We don&#39;t need them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the event of an emergency, the insectars were able to create bodies that looked like a solidified magicules. That&#39;s why they can enter any world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While it would be useful to have the undead elves, it was not necessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, that is what happened with Minaza.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She took in the materials of that world and incarnated them, and the insectoids she summoned had been confirmed to have the same properties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is why while it was difficult to cross worlds, once they had crossed over to another world, they were able to fully exercise their unrivaled power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time, the problem of &ldquo;crossing worlds&rdquo; had been solved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was natural for Zelanus to give in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he didn&#39;t need to consider his allies, he could choose from among the phantoms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, the right choice would be to choose the strongest and most useful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Zalario and Obera, of the &ldquo;Three Phantom Commanders,&rdquo; will be chosen. Shall we fill the remaining seven positions with the executives?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have an opinion on that as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re welcome to speak freely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seeing this, Dino thought to himself, &lsquo;Zalario is a serious man, unlike me.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With permission, Zalario spoke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Unlike us &ldquo;Primordials</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt95" id="ftnt_ref95">[95]</a></sup><span class="c0">,&rdquo; those below the cherubs are weak-willed. In the other world, they would be able to fight by force, but in the future, I&#39;m afraid that we won&#39;t be able to count on them as a fighting force.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. Then what do you suggest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Rather, why don&#39;t we leave the race for survival in the hands of nature?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario had abandoned his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As was the case with Cornu&#39;s men, they had been taken over by the humans who had possessed them in the other world when they had invaded, and had thus lost their sense of self.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And now, under the influence of Vega&#39;s cells, their emotions were running wild. It was unlikely that giving such people a valuable substitute would help them in the coming battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There are still many who stand in our way. Velgrynd, Veldora, and the demon lords are still alive. Even those damned demons will interfere, those tools that do nothing more than follow orders&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not worth it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By your will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In response to Zalario&#39;s statement, Feldway nodded, for he too was concerned about the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Yes. What matters is the strength of will. If one doesn&rsquo;t have a strong enough desire, giving them an Ultimate Skill is meaningless. To put it another way&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No matter how strong the ego was, there was no need to worry about betrayal if he gave them the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Alternative.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway looked at Michael, and their gazes met. Apparently, he had another opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is your opinion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was going to call in the seraphim and possess them with the all-powerful &lsquo;Army of Angels, Armageddon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s fine, but we don&#39;t know how many can be called, or what kind of will they&rsquo;ll possess, do we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seven at most can be called. But whether the seraphim have a will or not is something we won&#39;t know until we summon them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If an undead elf possesses a seraphim, it will be more powerful than an awakened demon lord. However, its strength of will was something to worry about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As was the case with themselves, it took many years for their egos to be established.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway&#39;s conclusion was that a hastily developed force would be useless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here is what Zelanus had to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Interesting. If you have any seraphim left over, why don&#39;t I or my children eat them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway thought about this as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were currently in a collaborative relationship because their interests were aligned. As soon as one of them achieved their goals, there was a good chance they&rsquo;d go back to being adversaries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He hesitated to reinforce such an opponent, but it would be an effective strategy to ruin the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be put on hold. We&#39;ll think about it then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Understood. I&rsquo;m not saying you have to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The conversation about the seraphim was postponed and they returned to the question of who should incarnate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, after all, we should use Zalario as a reincarnation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&#39;s fine. Feldway is right about eliminating uncertainties.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No objections.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, both sides agreed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;ll go with Zalario&#39;s idea. Are you okay with that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway asked his group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was posed as a question, but the decision was already made. There was no way that Dhalis and the others could argue with him, since they would be considered weak if they objected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, it was decided that Zalario and the others would possess the undead elves, and at the same time, unleash the wills that resided in their bodies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the decision made, the incarnation ceremony began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time, the incarnation would be performed by Zalario and five of his subordinates. Also Obera and Oma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali would be in charge of imbuing the undead elf with an ego.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">What are they going to do with the extra one?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Kagali wondered this, her eyes met Feldway&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s Kagali, isn&#39;t it? Kondou&#39;s death seems to have broken your hold, but what are you planning to do about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;This is it,&rsquo; Kagali braced herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Will you let me go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali asked cautiously, unsure of how much was allowed to be said. There was a surprising response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;After this ritual is over, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If that&#39;s the case, your role will be finished once you have created the undead elves as a substitute. You&#39;ve done enough good, so if you want, I&#39;ll send you back to earth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;No way,&rsquo; Kagali thought, confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At best, she thought she&rsquo;d be locked up. At worst, she was prepared to be punished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet, she was allowed to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no lie in Feldway&#39;s words. As such, there was no need for a complicated negotiation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The difference in power was so obvious that Kagali was of no use for him. Kagali couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason to deceive such a person, so she thought it safe to assume that his words were true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, Kagali treaded on thin ice as she made her next request.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it possible for you to break Yuuki-sama&#39;s control and let us go with him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Michael who answered that question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t allow that. Because the &lsquo;Ultimate Skill &#39;Greedy King (Mammon)&rsquo; owned by Yuuki Kagurazaka is also beneficial to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Michael, Yuuki&#39;s power was of great use, regardless of his personal fighting ability. Therefore, he rejected the idea of releasing him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, understanding this, stopped wishing for more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">What should I do?, Is it okay to run away?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway added on to Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If it&#39;s just you and the two of them, I can send you all back. However, the Cardinal World will be rough. I hate the people on Earth. Not that I need the death of every living thing to achieve my goal, but it will inevitably be engulfed in flames in a war with those who stand in our way. But that is the punishment. Those whom Veldanava-sama loved have betrayed that love. Sanctions will be necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali felt a chill run down her spine as his words were spoken so plainly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To be engulfed in flames would mean that the whole world would be affected by the war. In that case, it was hard to say that the place they escaped to would be safe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki was still under their control, and if the absolute powerhouses here went on a rampage, there would be no safe place on earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;In the first place&hellip;&rsquo; Kagali thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">We wanted to create a country where we could live happily, but it would be too vain to hope for that under these circumstances. In this situation, the most important thing is to survive. And to do that, we need power&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It might have been a foolish decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But at the time, it seemed to Kagali that this was the only correct answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why&mdash;she stated what she wished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please give me an undead elf, and hopefully, allow me to carry a seraphim in this body&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali wished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She hoped to abandon her fragile body and be reborn as undead elf. Then, she would take in the seraphim and gain great power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She needed power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because if you have power, nothing more can be taken from you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s words had no chance of winning, but no one argued with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino had a dumbfounded expression, but said nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario and Obera only followed Michael&#39;s decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And the insectar was indifferent. He was not interested in the weak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the midst of these reactions, Michael nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, interesting. But I will not tolerate betrayal. If you accept my Ultimate Enchantment, I will grant you your wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I swear I will not betray you. And I will accept your dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The deal was made.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To make an undead elf develop an ego is equivalent to awakening its original personality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In some cases, the strongest will prevails, while in other cases, a new ego is born from a mixture of the two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even for Kagali, the outcome was unknown. As one could see from Tear and Footman, it was difficult to invoke a targeted personality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So even Kagali herself had to gamble whether her ego would win or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even so, she knew she had to obtain the power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, after awakening the eight egos, she performed an awakening ritual on her own undead elf. After that, she escaped from the homunculus and transferred into the undead elf.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, the ritual ended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As was expected, the result was&mdash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario wakes up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He realizes that he is wrapped in the armor of flesh, and that he can wield great power in the Cardinal World.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera wakes up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She proves the pride in her heart that her noble will cannot be defeated by anyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Dhalis was about to wake up, he realized that there was another person inside him. His name was Torneot, and he was a man of great ambition. He felt that his skills as a warrior had become his own, and he was convinced that Dhalis himself had greatly increased his presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nice wakes up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She became stronger at the command, but she was no different. Her strong ego is still intact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oma wakes up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With her indomitable will intact, she embraces a being of similar sensibilities. Their name was Zero, but now they were Oma&#39;s flesh and blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They, Orca-Aria wake up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With Aria&#39;s knowledge as a wizard and Orca&#39;s strength as a warrior. Both of their egos coexisted, and they were reborn as magical warriors. There was not a shred of their former self left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Arios wakes up. His Unique Skill &#39;Murderer&#39; is still intact. He has not forgotten the grudge of being killed by Damrada and has resurrected to seek greater strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai Furuki wakes up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cannot die because she has left her sickly brother behind, not here, but in the world beyond, in the world she was meant to live in. So she vows to return.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, eight people have awakened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Only one remains.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But she is still in a deep sleep&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was dreaming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was so, so long ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A dream from when she was still Demon Lord Kazaream?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a dream from much, much earlier, when she was just a girl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She can&#39;t even remember her name now, but Kagali was a happy princess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s country was founded on the site where &lsquo;high humans&rsquo; had built a great civilization. It was a paradise for the elf race, a magical superpower that was flourishing thanks to the flowing rivers, lush forests, rich plains, and the ruins of the ancient magical empire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then&mdash;her father, the king, suddenly went mad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali remembered him as a very kind and gentle man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One day, the king who had been praised as the king of the high elves, suddenly changed into a different person. He changed his name, and began to call himself Jahil, the Great Magician.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her memory of what happened after that was not clear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil committed tyranny to the utmost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He exploited his people and sought only his own glory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He repeated his foolish experiments and created all sorts of nightmares.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was one of those who had fallen victim to this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, a high elf, was stripped of her powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was killed and brought back to life as an undead elf.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that time, she was given an ugly appearance and the name &ldquo;Kazaream.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her beautiful appearance was gone, and she became a cursed figure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rotten flesh covered her bones. It was so dry that it did not smell of decay, though perhaps that was for the best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Few people knew the secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was so grieved that she began to cover herself with a mask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&lsquo;&lsquo;Why are you doing this to me&mdash;!?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt96" id="ftnt_ref96">[96]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Gera-gera-gera-gera!

Are you ridiculing me as well? My daughter no good to me after all. I can&#39;t afford to make the same mistake as her. I have instilled my loyalty, but you can&#39;t be trusted! Kazaream, today you will be a man. Do you understand?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was an absolute command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Kagali&#39;s words never reached &lsquo;his&rsquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt97" id="ftnt_ref97">[97]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;father, Jahil, and the conversation was cut short.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was lucky that she had not been killed&mdash;No, it was only because she had already been killed and turned into a faithful puppet that she had not been discarded to be used as a tool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was then that Kagali parted ways with her father.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, the nightmare continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The glory of the arrogant Jahil, the Great Magician, seemed to know no bounds, but the end eventually came.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason for this was his foolish attempt to make a puppet of the Dragon Empress Milim which incurred her wrath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Soma,&rsquo; the super magic capital, fell into ruins overnight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not known whether Jahil was dead or alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was presumed that he was dead, as it was unlikely that he could have survived that flash of light. So Kagali thought more about the people who were important to her than about the dead man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The maidservants who had always looked after her with kindness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The knights who followed her after she became a warrior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her beloved people who lived happily ever after.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thinking of those she loved, she invoked the forbidden spell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The forbidden spell: Demon Death Birthday&mdash;she had already learned the theory of the spell by becoming a test subject herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The spell was perfected, and Tear, Footman, and Clayman were born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were lovely, sweet children, all named by Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And in doing so, she learned a fact she did not want to know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The undead elves created by her spell were not ugly at all. Only Kagali was made ugly on purpose to be so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That hateful father, King Jahil, had taken away her beauty just to make Kagali suffer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if she knew that, it was already too late for her to do anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s appearance was the result of a curse, and there was no way to restore it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, the children that Kagali had created did not leave her alone. They, too, hid their true faces with masks and shared Kagali&#39;s suffering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was not alone, and the hope for survival grew within her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The four of them were then joined by the elf tribes that had survived in various places.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;Let us rebuild our own country once again.

As a result, all those who adored Kagali were cursed and turned into dark elves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that time, Kagali also acted as if she was cursed. Kagali and Tear were able to endure the curse because they were undead elves&hellip;but they recognized themselves and lamented that they were different from everyone else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was fortunate that she had been hiding her true face with a mask and no one noticed her, but it made her even more sad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear&#39;s presence was the only thing that saved her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After that, Kagali and her friends abandoned their homeland and fled. Even though they had some regrets, they left together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They wandered around, and finally found their next safe haven.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When everyone&#39;s lives had stabilized, Kagali decided to visit her homeland again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She needed to recover the treasures she had left behind, but more than anything, she wanted to see her homeland again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The city had perished, but it still shone beautifully in her memories. She decided that she had to cut off her regrets and use them as food for the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, she set off, and on her way, she met a man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;What, you&hellip;If you were watching me, you could have helped me, right?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Don&#39;t be stupid. Someone like me is no match for that evil dragon.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;You&#39;re being too modest. From my point of view, you look like trouble enough&hellip;Ouch&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man&#39;s name was Sarion Grimwald&mdash;the Chosen Hero who drove away the Chaos Dragon from this land.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, he was dying from the mortal combat with the Chaos Dragon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t push yourself. Now, the restoration magic&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;It&#39;s useless, so don&#39;t do it. The Chaos Dragon&#39;s attacks are cursed, and my wounds won&#39;t heal. I had prepared several means of recovery, but this is how it is.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, Sarion was blown from the chest down, and it was a miracle he was even still alive. The fact that he could afford to laugh despite this, showed that he had a tremendous mental capacity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I need you to pass on a message. I&#39;m here to tell you that I defeated Chaos Dragon and died in style just like a Chosen Hero&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Huh, what Chosen Hero? Before you die, I have a proposal. With my evil ways, there is a chance you can survive. You may lose your memory, you may end up like this, but are you willing to give it a try?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, Kagali took off her mask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What he saw was her ugly face. But seeing that, Sarion smiled wryly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s with you? You&#39;ve got a good point though. If I just died here, Silvia would kill me. Considering that, this offer is the best thing that could happen to me!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Are you sure? I&#39;m cursed. I&#39;m willing to do evil rather than be persecuted. If you&#39;re a Chosen Hero, I am prepared to become a demon lord and protect everyone. Besides, if you use this evil method, you&#39;ll become my puppet, right?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&#39;t care, I don&#39;t care, it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m a free man, and I am not going to be easily controlled. Besides, there is always a cause and effect between a Chosen Hero and a demon lord. That&#39;s how you and I came to be, isn&#39;t it?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;You&#39;re an interesting guy, talking nonsense at this point. Then, you can be my puppet!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Negotiations were concluded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali took Sarion&#39;s words as a joke, but they were true. And as a result of this whim, Sarion became undead himself and survived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was the moment when &ldquo;Curse Lord&rdquo; Kazaream and &ldquo;Wonder Pierrot&rdquo; Laplace were born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since then, many things had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Securing the dominant territory. The war against humans and demi-humans was fierce, but she overcame persecution and emerged as &ldquo;Curse Lord&rdquo; Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was recognized as one of the demon lords, and steadily expanded his power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He recommended Karion, the Beast Master, and Frey, the Sky Queen, as demon lords, and formed a powerful alliance with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everything was going well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So much so that he didn&#39;t realize that he had grown complacent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali next set her sights on an up-and-coming man named Leon. The plan was to teach Leon, who called himself a demon lord in the middle of nowhere, a lesson in humility and bring him under control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The moment she saw him, Kagali felt a pang of jealousy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This man who called himself a demon lord, Leon, was too beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had become disfigured by her demon father, the king. She had been deprived of her gender and had been struggling to live&mdash;The appearance of Leon, who was a man, yet more beautiful than a woman, slowed down her thinking, and Kagali made the great mistake of misjudging her opponent&#39;s strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali lost her body to Leon&#39;s blow, and was forced to wander around with only her spiritual body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a miracle that she did not disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had a grudge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But more than that, she had a desire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Kagali clung to life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using what little power she had left as the Curse Lord, she took the time to prepare for her own resurrection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, in a daze, she made one last summoning attempt&mdash;unconsciously failing to take over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her plan failed and she gained no flesh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rest was destroyed&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&mdash;Help me. Save me. I don&#39;t want to be taken from you. All I want is to live happily with my friends, but why am I alone in this&mdash;?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She lamented her misfortune and asked for help, but no one answered her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was not alone, but no one helped her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a journey of hardship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ideals were far away and Kagali was the leader of the pack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no room for whining, and she had to always look forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Kagali had given up hope of being saved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only people she could trust were herself and her beloved friends. That is how she had lived her life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But that boy&mdash;Yuuki Kagurazaka, he&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;All right. You seem to be tired, so rest inside me for now.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&mdash;!?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki Kagurazaka reached out to Kagali, who had tried to take his life, and to whom no one had ever saved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few years later&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali spent the next few years resting inside Yuuki, consulting and advising him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was fortunate that the Unique Skill &lsquo;Schemer&rsquo; was a skill that could be used by souls alone, but there were still many troublesome opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In particular, a girl named Mariabell Rosso was extremely troublesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki was a genius strategist, and Kagali was confident in his own intelligence. But even with cooperation and scheming of these two, it was extremely difficult to outsmart Mariabell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were outmatched in every aspect, including financial and human resources. Even if they gained an organization to free themselves, Mariabell would grasp the right to free it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I&#39;ll kill her. If we don&#39;t get rid of her someday, our plan will fail.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I&#39;m sure of it. That demon in a girl&#39;s skin is the biggest obstacle for us.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A battle in the economic sphere cannot be won or lost based on simple combat ability alone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was a child, but was still like that. When Mariabell grew up and became an adult, they would not be able to compete with in every aspect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few years had passed since the two of them had made such a decision, and a time for change had arrived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The birth of the mysterious slime, Demon Lord Rimuru&mdash;was not it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, who had been inside Yuuki, had finally taken on the body of a homunculus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki had kept his promise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">This is my original form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki&#39;s kindness made Kagali so happy that she wanted to cry, but she kept a cool expression on her face. She tried to maintain her masculine tone, but Laplace stopped her. He was pretending to be teasing Kagali, but was actually really looking out for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I appreciate it, boss.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali thanked him from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that she had a physical body, Kagali could look forward to delicious meals and desserts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cream puffs were especially delicious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Spending a happy time with friends, laughing. How happy they were!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, that happiness did not last long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Clayman was dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the loss of another precious friend, Kagali realized&mdash;Kagali and the others realized once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the sake of their own happiness, they must conquer the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To become the rulers of this world and lead it correctly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Stupid, arrogant, and cute Clayman. I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that. Rest now and watch over us. We will make our ambitions come true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali and the others were not on the side of justice, but they were not evil, either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were moderate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is why they should be able to create a world where everyone can live happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Believing this, they continued their activities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They defeated Mariabell, were exposed by Demon Lord Rimuru, escaped to the Empire, and was taken over by Lieutenant Kondou.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Yuuki was also taken over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s heart was about to break, but she could not give up now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I swear I will not betray you. And I will accept your dominion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A contract must be fulfilled, and the benefits received must be returned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Kagali was willing to use any means necessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, Kagali wakes up&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leaving behind the fragile body of a homunculus and regaining the body of undead elf, she was stronger and more beautiful than when &lsquo;he&rsquo; was Demon Lord Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, nine undead elves were born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But this was only the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Kagali finally awoke, she saw Feldway and the others had brought Velzard back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael intended to take the &lsquo;Dragon Factor&rsquo; from Velzard for further evolution, but before that, he used the &#39;Army of Angels, Armageddon&#39; to implant in Kagali and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was determined not to compromise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The seven seraphim were successfully summoned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Those who were willing to incarnate were selected from those who were not former angels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was naturally chosen as one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The others were Tear, Footman, Vega, Orca-Aria, Arios, and Mai Furuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Their bodies were reborn as t</span><span class="c0">he tremendous powers clashed within their body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Thus Kagali and the others, with the exception of Vega, were reborn as &ldquo;Y&#333;ten&rdquo;

I never knew you worked for Feldway-sama, so do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali whispered quietly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino replied matter-of-factly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t tell you that. I&#39;m a &ldquo;watcher.&rdquo; The whole point is to keep a low profile. And while I&#39;m at it, let me correct your mistake. I am a former associate of Feldway&#39;s, not a subordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino had infiltrated the Octagram and was working as a &ldquo;watcher.&rdquo; His purpose was to monitor the earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino, Pico, and Gracia, the three Fallen Angels, were sent on a special mission to investigate the human world. By the will of Veldanava, they were charged with monitoring the human race so that it would not be destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The role of the demon lords, led by Guy, was to rebuke the human race when it grew too much. And to prevent demon lords from going too far, the Chosen Hero existed as a deterrent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Dino&#39;s role to investigate whether the causal relationship between demon lords and heroes was working properly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Dino attracted attention with his prominent position as a demon lord, Pico and Gracia conducted their investigation without falling into the spotlight. It was also Dino&#39;s hidden role to create a cover-up to make it easier for those two to move about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, now that Veldanava has not returned, there was no one to report to. Therefore, Dino had been enjoying his free life as a demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino had no intention of hiding that fact as he was openly talking about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali wondered why he was even here then. Perhaps it showed on her face, so Gracia answered with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He owes Feldway a lot of money, so he can&#39;t say no when asked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pico followed suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But he can&#39;t go back to Demon Lord Rimuru, so he&#39;s decided to follow Michael-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No way, Kagali thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess that&#39;s it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali didn&#39;t believe he was following Michael for that reason, but it was ridiculous, and Kagali agreed that it was typical of Dino.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali changed her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what was Demon Lord Rimuru like? I have a grudge against him for killing Clayman, and I&#39;d like to avenge him if I get the chance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was a lie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In reality, she had no grudge against Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no doubt that they shared a history with each other. However, he had formed an alliance with Yuuki, and even if they were to become enemies again, he was still an interesting presence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The one to blame for Clayman&#39;s death would be Lieutenant Kondou, who had controlled him, and Michael, who had controlled even Kondou.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali calmly understood this, but she was not foolish enough to say it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino answered Kagali&#39;s question without going any deeper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even his subordinates are troublesome. Especially that Zegion guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the last mission, Dino&#39;s role was to neutralize the labyrinthine forces. Specifically, his mission was to kidnap or eliminate Ramiris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino claims to have come close to succeeding, but the reality is that he failed. The reason, he says, is that he was interrupted by Zegion, a powerful majin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is he that strong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not just strong. It was a level that was seriously insane. Rumor has it he&#39;s the strongest of the Dungeon&#39;s Elite Ten</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt99" id="ftnt_ref99">[99]</a></sup><span class="c0">, so he&#39;s stronger than me at the least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino affirmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was tired from the long series of battles, and had underestimated his opponent a little. Zegion, on the other hand, did not even take Dino seriously and played him lightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s true feelings were that he didn&#39;t want to be a sore loser.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s a weak thing to say. You can just crush him! Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll crush him myself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega boasted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">It must be nice to be so stupid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino thought, but didn&#39;t say it out loud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no point in saying anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Vega is still the same. Like this, even if he has the power, we might not be able to use him effectively&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali sighed in exasperation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was all well and good to be confident in your own strength, but it&#39;s no use if you lack the most important sense in battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was the ability to grasp the difference in strength between you and your opponent. Facing an unbeatable opponent will only result in losing strength unnecessarily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pico and Gracia seemed to understand this and frowned in displeasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They didn&#39;t say anything, probably because they were not close to Vega and realized that there was no point in advising him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That appeared to be the end of the conversation&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, if you guys see a bug-shaped majin (insectar) in the labyrinth, be careful, okay? The beetle type is Zegion, but Apito, the bee type, is dangerous too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zelanus took a bite out of Dino&#39;s casual remark, which was about to conclude the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A beetle type and bee type? Tell me more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino was pressured by the tremendous spirit. And, unintentionally, he disclosed as much information as he knew, though not much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;O-Oh? Well um, I heard that they protected Rimuru before he became a demon lord&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zelanus was silent as he listened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s story was over, and an awkward silence was hanging in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Give me some kind of a response!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino thought that Zelanus was intimidating. Since he didn&#39;t want to talk to Zelanus, he decided to change the subject and cover up the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Anyway, that&rsquo;s it. In Ramiris&#39;s labyrinth, the defenders have a complete advantage. There are many strong players like Zegion in there, so you should consider that it will be very difficult to defeat them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, Dino ended the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As silence reigned once again, those gathered were caught up in their own thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali had a lot of things to think about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino&#39;s remarks were important, but for now, the first priority was to learn about her own changes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Kagali was searching for information and checking her on her changes, she felt a tremendous surge of power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The seraphim are the highest-ranking angels, said to be comparable to the awakened demon lords. Kagali, who had taken in the power of the seraphim and become a &ldquo;yoten,&rdquo; had become so strong that her demon-lord-self seemed ridiculous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, apart from her Unique Skill &lsquo;Schemer,&rsquo; she discovered that there was a new skill embedded in her soul.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ultimate Enchantment &#39;Domination King (Melchizedek)&#39; &ndash; given the separation of Michael&#39;s &#39;control&#39; ability, it boasted a terrifying performance that could instantly analyze any ability and place it under control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, because Kagali herself was also under the control of the power, it became impossible for her to betray Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">It&#39;s terrifying. A battle between people with such power is a world I can&#39;t even imagine&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Those were her true feelings, but when the time came to fight, Kagali&#39;s body would slaughter the enemy on its own, without her even thinking about it. Kagali instinctively understood this and felt afraid of her own change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&mdash;and that&#39;s why she can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She wanted to test the immense power she had acquired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew she shouldn&#39;t think about it that way, but for some reason she still wanted to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knows the opportunity to test it would come soon enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her thirst for revenge was supposed to be gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet she felt anger towards Leon for killing her, and towards Rimuru for killing Clayman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And she wonders if she can beat them now&hellip;She knows it&#39;s pointless, but still can&#39;t stop the desire that wells up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Was she really weaker than Dino now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No. She never thought so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, the current Kagali, who had become a &ldquo;Youten,&rdquo; was on the same level as Dino.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Huh, that&#39;s pathetic, Dino. He&rsquo;s been like that since he was a demon lord, but I never saw Dino fight himself. That&#39;s why he&#39;s weak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali had a hard time suppressing the feeling of amusement that welled up inside of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She would never be able to let her guard down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But still&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though Dino was at the mercy of her opponent, she still felt like she could win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all, Kagali&#39;s power surpassed even that of an awakened demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even the older demon lords, Ruminas and Dino, would not be defeated by the current Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If so, then even Demon Lord Leon should be no match for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Just wait, Leon. It&#39;s your turn to cry! You&#39;re next!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali continued to think, suppressing a faint feeling of pleasure. This was the kind of radicalized thinking that came from being ruled by a skill, but Kagali herself didn&rsquo;t notice&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega doesn&#39;t think about anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He only waits for orders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He has gained power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having experienced death so many times, he has looked into the further depths of this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He ate Gladium and took in the blue dragon spear&mdash;a mythical grade and his weapon of choice. He even devoured the seraphim and made its power his own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that moment, he felt the fragments of the skills he had acquired fuse together and strengthen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His countless defeats had given him strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An incarnation of explosive power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is who Vega is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Recreated by Yuuki&#39;s hands, Vega had become the ultimate combat creature as a result of incorporating, fusing, and complementing various Skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And finally, the Unique Skill &lsquo;Evil Eater&rsquo; had evolved into the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Evil Dragon King (Azi Dahaka),&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had a destructive power that could overwhelm existing Skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a disaster for the world that this skill had gone to Vega, who had clue about controlling power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Perhaps it is because he tried to master his power without thinking that he was able to acquire such a skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Be that as it may&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vega waits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He waits for orders to come to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He can only annihilate and devour those who stand before him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino looks down and thinks about the current situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How did this happen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No matter how many times he asks himself, he is unable to find the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A long time ago, he was given a role by Veldanava and came down to earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t think he had much of an ego at the time, but at some point he was able to think for himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asked his colleagues, Pico and Gracia, about it, and they seemed to have developed their own egos at almost the same time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Various things happened, and Dino and his friends became fallen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He became a demon lord to obey the orders of his vanished Lord, which was his only purpose in life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino continued to watch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He planned to watch the outcome of Guy and Rudra&#39;s game without intervening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His loyalty to Veldanava was absolute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Someday&mdash;Dino believed that one day, at the end of time, he would definitely come back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then they met.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That mysterious slime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The brilliance of a soul that could be understood at a glance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was different from Veldanava, but it felt familiar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then the good days began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He hated working, but was happy to be used by humans. Dino almost couldn&#39;t believe it, but for some reason, he felt satisfied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because it was there that he found friends to work together with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Oh, but even so, I betrayed Ramiris&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What Dino regrets is the attack on Ramiris five months ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Feldway&#39;s orders, he betrayed Rimuru and the others, and invited the enemy into the labyrinth. He then moved to capture Ramiris, the most important target.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The order was to dispose of her if she could not be captured, but Dino did not intend to do so. He really had not intended to kill her, but rather to seal her with &lsquo;Deep Hypno&rsquo; and cover it up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fortunately or unfortunately, the attempt ended in failure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And now, he was wondering why he had done such a thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">No, no. Then that&rsquo;s proof that he was telling the truth, I suppose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what Dino thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t want to make excuses for betraying Ramiris, but he was pretty sure he was under Michael&#39;s control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">In other words, as long as I have &#39;Heavenly King Astarte&#39;, I can&#39;t go against Michael or Feldway. Seriously, you&#39;ve got to be kidding me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although he had grasped the situation accurately, he couldn&#39;t come up with a clever idea to overcome this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The saving grace was that Rimuru believed in Dino.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">He&rsquo;s a shrewd guy, but he&#39;s also a softie. Even if he&rsquo;s easily fooled, one can&rsquo;t be too careful with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino suddenly sees a blue butterfly mark on his right arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He thought that Zegion had overlooked it, but it seems that the birthmark had become a corridor connecting his mind and heart. Thus, Rimuru was able to contact him through that mark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">He&rsquo;s seriously so shrewd, that guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had spoken directly to his heart, and yet was able to steal all of his information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, he was forcing him to spy with impunity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But rather than feeling abhorrent or something like that, Dino felt strangely refreshed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, he was happy that Rimuru believed him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;See you later,&rsquo; huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino realized that for the first time in a long time, he felt truly happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then, he thought to himself, &lsquo;what a troublesome situation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino had no intention of betraying his creator, Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Michael and Feldway&#39;s goal was to revive Veldanava, then Dino thinks that he should cooperate with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;This has really become troublesome&rsquo;&mdash;Those were Dino&#39;s honest feeling at the moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Well, whatever. I&#39;m not of much use to them anyway. I mean, the more I work, the weaker I become, so there&#39;s nothing I can do about it. Besides, it&#39;s better for both sides if I don&#39;t work hard, so it&#39;s a wish come true!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The good thing about Dino is that he doesn&#39;t immediately worry about things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The always positive Dino, who was unrivaled when it came to slacking off, came to his conclusion with an easy-going mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This positivity was what made Dino such a frightening man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino, feeling refreshed, waited for Feldway and the others with a cheerful face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Arios thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His superiors, Kagali and the others, were talking, but he had no idea what they were talking about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He wanted to complain, but his instincts told him that it would not be a good idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And rightly so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Arios was under Kagali&#39;s control.

Even though he had great power, he was only able to wield it in the Otherworld. In the Cardinal World, the more power he exerted, the more energy he lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In order to prevent this, a body was needed, but it was difficult to prepare a vessel that could withstand the power of someone as powerful as Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now that that problem had been solved, he would be able to show his true strength on the surface, but there was still a big problem that arose here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Oh dear. Because of my increased power, I seem to have acquired the angelic system skill &lsquo;Judgement King (Israfil)&rsquo;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, that was the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario had acquired the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Judgement King (Israfil)&rsquo; upon his incarnation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I can&#39;t defy Michael with this. But if I threw it away, I would be suspected of treason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From Zalario&#39;s point of view, Feldway is a colleague, and although he recognizes him as his superior, he does not hold absolute obedience to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, he was skeptical about Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway trusts Michael, but Zalario does not. Zalario was not so easily convinced by a will arising from a skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For now, he was convinced of their purpose and agreed with it, but it was unknown if that would last forever. There was no doubt that he had wanted to avoid possessing an angelic skill, in case their paths ever diverged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, the &lsquo;Judgement King (Israfil)&rsquo; had been obtained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As long as it was not the Ultimate Enchantment, Michael&#39;s will would not intervene. There is no doubt that this was a natural skill that he acquired, and for that reason, it seemed inadvisable to throw it away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Now, I wonder how much Michael knows about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no doubt that he could rule over the angelic skills, given his ability to control Velgrynd and Velzard. However, he should change his actions depending on how far he could grasp the owner of the system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">My will is my own, and I will not allow it to be rewritten without my knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario was a rational thinker.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, he did not interfere in the control of the True Dragon sisters out of respect for the high success rate of the operation, even if he really disliked the operation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And now, he was in the same position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Really, what a mess&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since he didn&#39;t oppose it in the first place, his current situation was his own fault. Even so, he pondered on how to deal with Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera was the same.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Like Zalario, Obera had acquired the Ultimate Skill of the Angelic System. And like Zalario, it was not something she wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What Obera obtained was the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Salvation King (Azrael).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was an incredibly powerful skill, but it was useless to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason is that those who were born as primordial beings already had administrative authority without having to rely on a Skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They could activate all kinds of magic instantly, and if they made full use of it, they wouldn&rsquo;t need to rely on Skills. It was more flexible and could be used to achieve anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Obera and the others, whose very existence was at the ultimate level, it made no difference whether they had Ultimate Skill or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why she got it at this moment, even though she didn&#39;t wish for it. Moreover, she was pretty sure that it was an angelic system skill&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">This is not good. If I don&rsquo;t do something, they might find out that I&#39;m disloyal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera, who had planned to turn completely, was now in a more serious situation than Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What should she do now? Obera thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She wouldn&rsquo;t worry about having her mind read.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not a problem for her to erase the surface thoughts of her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, this would not be the case if she were to be manipulated without knowing it, so she needed to think of a countermeasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Let&#39;s make a self-imposed suggestion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If a contradiction arose within herself, she would not hesitate to destroy the &lsquo;Salvation King (Azrael.)&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because she was an ultimate spiritual life form, she was capable of such unconventional actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, if that happened, it would mean a complete break away from Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Depending on the situation, even Obera would not be safe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even so, for the sake of Milim, the orphaned daughter of Veldanava, Obera believed that there was no need to worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">It would be nothing but disrespectful for us to discern the thoughts of the Creator. Feldway is too selfish, even though he may not resurrect of his own volition.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Obera believed that Milim was the rightful successor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A beautiful bell rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Solemn, clear, and tickling at the heartstrings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then the door opened, and out walked Michael, Feldway, and Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With just those three people, they radiated an air of supremacy that could blow away any divine spirit that had filled the hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Waiting for Michael to be seated, Feldway and Velzard also took their seats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, let&#39;s begin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the strategy meeting began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On command, Mai stood up and projected a three-dimensional image of the entire Cardinal World at the center of the round table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a miniature figure of the earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From a god&rsquo;s perspective, the stronghold of the demon lords was shown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These are the strongholds of the Octagram who are opposing us, and their key points. There are six of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The north pole of Guy, the western edge of Dagruel, the central west of Ruminas, the forest of Rimuru, the southeast of Milim, and the continent of Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In response to Michael&#39;s comment, Mai lit up six points of light on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would like to hear your opinions on how we should attack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Everyone,&rsquo; he had called out, but only a few people were actually within Feldway&#39;s line of sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were Zalario and Obera, and Yuuki and Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dino and his group were not good at planning operations, and Vega was not an option from the start. As for the others, he didn&rsquo;t give them the right to speak because he considered them to be beneath them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario and Obera were silent, as if watching the situation. Kagali, sensing the atmosphere, opened her mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In this case, the aggressor has the advantage. I think we should concentrate our forces and target a single spot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree. However, it is difficult to know where to aim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The defenders would have to spread out their forces. Kagali and Yuuki agreed that there was no need for the defender to match their opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, it was Dino who spoke up after hearing this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just so you know, you shouldn&#39;t go to Ramiris&#39; labyrinth. Following that, the capital of the Monster Federation, &ldquo;Rimuru,&rdquo; will be isolated in the labyrinth during the war. It won&rsquo;t be easy to get rid of, so I recommend you target it last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since this information was shared, no one objected. They realized that if they took too long in the labyrinth, they might be surrounded and annihilated by reinforcements from other countries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&#39;s do that last. By attacking elsewhere, we might be able to lure those who are holed up inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ramiris would become a huge nuisance if they were forced to play defense. With that in mind, they needed to plan his attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&#39;s no one left at the Frost Palace. There is no sign of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Velzard who suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her gaze was sharp and fixed on Leon&#39;s continent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, so the enemy has thought of a countermeasure. By consolidating the demon lords, they avoided dispersing their own forces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Indeed. It seems that there are five places on the ground where huge power is concentrated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai removed Guy&#39;s north pole point and strengthened the remaining five points of light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was only one less option, but the difficulty seemed to have increased greatly. However, the advantage of the attacker still remained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, where should they aim?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is where Zalario came in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Feldway-sama, I have a question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Michael-sama has absolute control over the angelic systems, but are we able to get a hint as to where the owners are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had asked an important question here, one that would affect him as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera was also in on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is a concern. If we can find out who they are, we should probably get them on our side first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Hmm,&rsquo; Michael nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I couldn&#39;t sense them before, but now I know. I know now that others possess the &lsquo;Judgement King (Israfil)&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Salvation King (Azrael),&rsquo; and I know that Dino and the others have the &lsquo;Heavenly King Astarte,&rsquo; &lsquo;Glory King (Haniel),&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rigor King (Jibril).&rsquo; The remaining &lsquo;Domination King (Melchizedek)&rsquo; is owned by Kagali, and Arios is the owner of the &lsquo;Punishment King (Sandalphon).&rsquo; And then there are the higher angelic systems that are the &lsquo;same rank&rsquo; as me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At those words, Michael frowned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;Not enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And with that, everyone became tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Feldway asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael responded with a brief explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;First, Velgrynd&#39;s &lsquo;Charity King (Raguel)&rsquo; was recovered and given to the right person.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No one responded to this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was an eerie silence, but unconcerned, Michael continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then there was the &lsquo;Patience King&#39; (Gabriel),&rsquo; which was never recovered and remains in Velzard&#39;s possession.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The icy beauty remained motionless, her face expressionless. This was a natural step to maintain the rule of the &lsquo;Ultimate Dominion.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So far, the owners of these skill are known, but three of the four remaining skill are problematic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that said, Michael&#39;s explanation continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael had taken Velgrynd&#39;s power for himself and had also taken in Velzard&#39;s dragon factor. This greatly increased his power, allowing him to search for signs of the owners of the other angelic systems under his control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, he was only able to find the &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron),&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? If it was the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Hope King (Sariel),&rsquo; wouldn&#39;t it have belonged to &nbsp;the Chosen Hero Chronoa?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There was no response. I don&#39;t know if it&rsquo;s because my surveillance was unable reach Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth, or if there were other reasons.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, Ramiris is not to be underestimated. It&#39;s no wonder you can&#39;t see into the labyrinth. If that&#39;s the case, should we assume that the &lsquo;Covenant King (Uriel)&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Wisdom King (Raphael)&rsquo; also have owners in the same place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m not sure, but I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume so. After all, there is no other place I cannot explore with my skill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were no other skills created by Veldanava, and the only other possibility was Ramiris&#39; Intrinsic Skill, &lsquo;Labyrinth Creation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Michael&#39;s conclusion was that the remaining three existed in the same place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But now they were already gone, and even their essence had been changed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unaware of this, Michael decided that the problem had been resolved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so did Feldway and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. Well then, no problem. Either way, Veldora is in the labyrinth, and we&#39;re going to attack him anyway. We can find him and then add him to our ranks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it safe to assume that the enemy has someone on the inside?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly. We can find them at a glance, so we&#39;ll worry about that later. What we need to think about now is where to make our first target, but&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think we already have an answer. There&#39;s only one known owner, so why don&#39;t we add that one to the group first?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what Yuuki had decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">His free will had been taken away, but his ability to plan ahead</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt100" id="ftnt_ref100">[100]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;still remained intact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. The one who possesses the &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron)&rsquo; is here&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All eyes focused on his fingertips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael pointed to El Dorado, the capital of Leon&#39;s territory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s the Demon Lord Leon who killed me.&rdquo; Kagali muttered to herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was the moment when she realized that the flash of light that had burned her to the ground had been caused by the &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I guess it&rsquo;s decided. So, who&#39;s going to attack?&rdquo; Yuuki asked with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m going. I don&#39;t know care if it&#39;s Demon Lord Leon or whatever, but you don&#39;t mind if I eat him, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you not hear what was said? Leon could become one of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Che, damn. In that case, I&rsquo;ll just have to put up with the rest of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki and Vega were talking to each other, as if they had already decided where to attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no one to stop them, and the decision was made.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no need to declare war, since the goal of this war was to revive Veldanava.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael and Feldway decided as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Inevitably, the war would start with a surprise attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no need to spare any forces, but Feldway had his own ideas about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The goal is to obtain the owner of the &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron).&rsquo; It would be nice if we could get rid of some of the people who interfere with that, but it would be no fun to cause damage here. Therefore, let&#39;s leave the fools behind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He declared that he would attack only with the strongest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael&#39;s &lsquo;Ultimate Dominion&rsquo; was versatile but it was not unconditionally activated. It was an absolute dominion over the angelic system, but it required him to cross his line of sight with the target.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, the &lsquo;Regalia Dominion&rsquo; had even more complicated conditions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Dominion Bullet, which had been loaned to Lieutenant Kondou, could only be used on a single target, and the success rate was low unless the target was caught off guard. The &lsquo;Regalia Dominion,&rsquo; on the other hand, changed the number of people it controlled depending on the presence of the target. And most importantly was that the success rate was lower when the opponent was of the same rank as the user, meaning that they had to inflict a considerable blow or else it would fail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the very least, the opponent had to have a weaker presence than the user to succeed, so it was a difficult skill to use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The current value of Michael&#39;s existence was about 90 million. However, Yuuki&#39;s existence value (about 2 million) was subtracted from it, so an attack on Veldora, whose existence value was over 88 million, would not succeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael had no way of knowing that, but nevertheless, he believed that controlling Veldora would be a difficult task. That is why he needed to gather his forces before attacking Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was also why they were trying to add the targeted person to their ranks without diminishing the strength of their own camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the members of the sortie were decided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m staying behind.&rdquo; Declared Dino, who was staying behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What about me and my army?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want you all to be ready to move your troops. We&#39;re planning to launch a full-scale invasion following this operation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The insectars led by Zelanus began to prepare for war, as did the phantom army.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s army was being coordinated by Dhalis and Nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since Obera&#39;s army was still deployed in the otherworldly stronghold, Obera was to return and hand over the control to Oma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, all the remaining officers went out to battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it was just the officers, Mai&#39;s &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement&rsquo; would take them to their destination in an instant. With Obera, there would be no problem to identify the coordinates using &lsquo;Presence Detection,&rsquo; and they could easily meet up with each other immediately using &lsquo;Spatial Transportation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Based on this judgment, the surprise operation was launched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c17"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c11">Chapter 4<br></span><span>Shattered Ambition</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I received the report from Dino, but the contents were ridiculous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I expected, Michael had made his move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was within expectations, so that was good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What surprised me was Obera&#39;s actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To my surprise, she had left Michael&#39;s group with her own troops.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was stunned by this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;What, are you kidding me?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m serious. I was also shocked. By the way, this was something Michael didn&rsquo;t know yet either. I was about to tell him.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hearing that, I was convinced that this guy (Dino) was an asshole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were too many things going on, and this was not the time to be bothered. No, even before that, I thought he should report to his own boss before leaking the inside information to me, the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But well, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s because Dino had such a personality that I was saved, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a moment, I felt a little sorry for Michael and Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But before I got too excited, I had to ask something important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;So, where did they decide to attack?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Leon&#39;s territory. As I said, Obera left and I&#39;m staying behind, but all the other officers have been mobilized. Pico and Gracia are also being taken by force, so if it comes to a fight, please be merciful to them.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;What kind of a convenient story is that!? Well, I&#39;ll keep it in mind.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Please do. Oh, and I have one more favor to ask.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&rsquo;I&#39;m busy too, so make it quick.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I listen to what Dino has to say as I prepare to go out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;As I thought, I really enjoyed working with Vesta-san and Ramiris, and I&#39;m bored here. So, Rimuru-san, please beat up Michael and free me!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was speechless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey, is your head okay? That&#39;s not something you say to an enemy, do you understand me?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;So mean! We&#39;re friends, aren&rsquo;t we? Don&#39;t be so cold! Oh, and by the way, did you apologize properly to Ramiris so that we could make up later?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Screw you! I told you to apologize to her yourself!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Wa&mdash;please wait, Rimuru-san!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Moving on&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, moving on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t allow myself to be manipulated by someone against my will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Do your best to escape from their control as soon as possible. If you don&#39;t do it soon, you&#39;ll lose your title of demon lord!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hahaha, I&#39;ll do my best. Well, I know you&#39;re a dependable guy. There&#39;s no one who&#39;s as good at leaving things to others as I am, so I&#39;ll just use you the best I can.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That had to be a joke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, I also thought that it was very typical of Dino.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;And one last piece of advice. That bastard Feldway is teaming up with the Insectars.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I know. Seems pretty dangerous.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not just dangerous. I had never seen that king Zelanus until before, but he might even be better than Guy. I can&rsquo;t know for sure until I actually fight him, but I know that I couldn&rsquo;t beat him even if I really tried. They&#39;re staying back this time, but we don&#39;t know when they&#39;ll make a move, so don&#39;t let your guard down.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;d like to say that it was just extra, but it was very valuable information, and also very unpleasant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just by hearing that he was like Guy or above, my depression level was at its max.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And more than that, if such a dangerous guy was waiting with his army, we needed to think of a countermeasure for immediate response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I thought about calling back Geld and the others whom I had left in various countries, but I decided not to do that either. We would be at a disadvantage if they targeted us while we were short-handed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that was the case, it seemed that we would have no choice but to make do with what we had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Thanks for the advice. I&#39;ll pass it on to everyone and be on the lookout. Well then, you&rsquo;re going to have to work really hard.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yeah. Don&rsquo;t die, Rimuru.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No need to tell me that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was my second life&mdash;My &lsquo;slime life,&rsquo; and I intended to enjoy more freedom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The war had been going on for a while now, and I was going to get rid of all the troubles and then take it easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And I was going to have good times with my friends, including Dino, of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;You too.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I replied to Dino, as if speaking from the heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as I finished my conversation with Dino, I summoned the remaining executives to the capital city &ldquo;Rimuru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The location was the &lsquo;Control Room&rsquo; in the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I looked at Leon&#39;s stronghold with the &lsquo;Argos&rsquo; surveillance magic, I saw that it was covered by a blizzard and that nothing else could be seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">El Dorado has a mild climate. A blizzard like this was unnatural, no matter how you look at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was obvious to everyone that Velzard was behind it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no contact from Leon and the others, and no visual confirmation of the enemy. There must be some kind of communication jamming going on there, and we had no choice but to trust in Dino&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since the enemy was coming out with only their main force, we needed to assemble an appropriate force. If we tried to support them inefficiently, the damage would be too great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we sent out too many, the labyrinth defense would be too thin, and if we sent too few, we would not be able to achieve our goal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a difficult decision to make.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, the enemy is also very powerful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as I explained what Dino had told me, Benimaru turned his attention to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he was eager to go, then I was not going to stop him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was planning to send just me, Ranga and Souei to support them, but I guess they&#39;re more powerful than I thought. We&#39;ll be in danger if only we show up, so Benimaru, you should join us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even have to ask. So, who else are you taking with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as Benimaru announced that he was going to take me, his face broke into a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I shut down Veldora&#39;s comment immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just think about it. Veldora was a good ally, and a great asset, but we had to remember that he was the enemy&#39;s target.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, you should be aware that you&#39;re being targeted. Besides, as long as you or I are safe, we can still be revived, so it&#39;s nonsense for the two of us to go out and fight together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kuaahahaha! I was careless. Just leave the protection of the labyrinth to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was in a serious pinch right now, so I was really counting on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once the most problematic child was convinced, I turned to Zegion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Zegion, and Apito, continue guarding the labyrinth. We can&#39;t leave this place empty because it seems like there is a dangerous enemy waiting for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leave it to me. I wish you the best of luck, Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How very reliable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dragon lords would remain as a force, and we&rsquo;d be able to analyze their strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That left Treyni-san, Beretta, and Charys.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Charys, keep an eye on Veldora to make sure he doesn&#39;t go out of control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t need to be told, sir. I&rsquo;ll keep a close eye on Veldora-sama so that Rimuru-sama can go into battle without worry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh? I&#39;m being monitored?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, I&#39;m curious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Read this and calm down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Charys handed Veldora a comic book to quiet him down, and I found it reassuring in a different sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just leave Master to us, we&#39;ll take care of him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The labyrinth is well guarded, and we are training so that we will not be caught unaware this time. I am looking forward to showing you the results.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;d rather not have that chance, but it was reassuring to know we were prepared for anything. I nodded back to Treyni-san, asking for her help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rimuru-sama has given me strength, and I am stronger than ever. I&#39;ve been training with Charys-dono, and I have no intention of losing to Dino-sama next time. Please rest assured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I believe you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whether they can beat Dino or not, the current Beretta team should be able to keep up with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was why&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m taking Kumara with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Me, Benimaru, Ranga, Kumara, and Souei were chosen as the members of this sortie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, there was still one thing that was bothering me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, Benimaru. I made the decision without asking your opinion, but if you don&#39;t like it, you can turn it down. Did you want to stay and protect your wives?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Momiji and Alvis were very pregnant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Apparently, the gestation period of monsters varied widely. Momiji&#39;s mother, Kaede, had been carrying Momiji in her belly for over three hundred years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the case of beastmen, some had embryos and some had eggs, even though they were the same species. Alvis was said to be have an embryo, but she also maintained her transformed state throughout her pregnancy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It may be that the human figure was more overworking, but it seemed that there were also individual differences. Well, it&#39;s not like I knew about out the whole biology of monsters yet, so there was no point in worrying about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s hope that some ecologists who were interested in the subject would solve it within a reasonable range.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I left it at that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What is important now was Benimaru&#39;s feelings of leaving his two pregnant wives to go to the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Which is more important, work or me?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think that this was one question that everyone hated to be asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, I had been a bachelor, so I never had to deal with that question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t regret it&mdash;I&rsquo;m not jealous, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was such a corporate slave that I couldn&#39;t even come home from work on my birthday, so I think it would have been bad if I had a girlfriend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emotionally, the wife took priority, but rationally, it might be the job. If one didn&rsquo;t have money, they couldn&rsquo;t make a living, so one would have no choice but to give priority to their work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, that is difficult because there are times when a man has no choice but to protect his family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is no doubt that it was ideal to work for an understanding company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, as a policy of our country, I wanted to pursue this ideal as much as possible. As for me personally, I didn&rsquo;t want Benimaru to have a marital crisis, and I wanted to respect his will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Benimaru replied, as if laughing at my concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is an unnecessary concern. I will do everything in my power to protect the people I love. In the first place, I wanted to have an heir so that they could take my place in case something happened to me. If you misunderstand that, I&rsquo;m not doing the right thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, that may be true in theory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But is that really okay with him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Strange as it may seem, I was the one who was lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As if to reassure me, Benimaru smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry. The safest place on earth is here, and I&#39;ve asked Hakurou to guard them. If something should happen, he&#39;ll take over for me and raise my successor. So, there&#39;s nothing to worry about! Besides, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to lose, and I don&#39;t doubt Rimuru-sama&#39;s victory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He said it so refreshingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Souei nodded his head in agreement, and looking around at the faces of the others, they all seemed to feel the same way. It made me wonder if I was the one who was wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hohoho. Rimuru-sama is very kind. It&#39;s probably because he was born in a time of peace, but that is not the mainstream way of thinking in a world of war. My daughter Momiji and Alvis-dono are prepared for this. On top of that, I believe in Benimaru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that he didn&rsquo;t call Benimaru &ldquo;young&rdquo; showed how serious he was about his statement. As if agreeing with Hakurou, Momiji and Alvis had arrived before I knew it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. There is no way that my husband can lose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I agree with Momiji-san. Benimaru-sama, if you leave us and die, we&#39;ll chase you to the ends of the earth. Please be prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seemed that these two were already prepared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that&#39;s the case, there was no time for me to be confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, I appreciate the sentiment. I&#39;m not saying we&#39;ll win, but I promise that we&#39;ll all make it back alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, just leave it to me, Rimuru-sama. All we have to do is win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I forgot to mention that Benimaru was an incredibly confident person. When he and Souei were together, it seemed like they could defeat any opponent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The same was true for Kumara and Ranga.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir. I will do my best too, and we won&rsquo;t be defeated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lord, I am with you! No matter who the enemy is, there is no doubt if it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There seemed to be some kind of a mistake, but I understood what they were trying to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. This is no time to feel lost, and there&rsquo;s no use worrying about it before the fight. Although the goal is to defend Leon, let&#39;s do our best to crush Michael&#39;s ambitions!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I declared as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Speaking calmly with Michael and coming to some beautiful understanding&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t going to pretend that we&rsquo;d be able to do something like that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He has no humanity, and he&rsquo;s willing to sacrifice anything to achieve his goal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was annoying, but in the end, I had no choice but to pick a fight with someone who was outside the line of mutual respect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&#39;s go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone nodded at my words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Do not worry about anything until after everything is over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I made up my mind to do so and began to &lsquo;Teleport&rsquo; everyone to the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the time Rimuru and the others had begun their preparations, the war had already begun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no declaration of war, and Vega began going out of control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Damn it, can&#39;t he at least try to follow the plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali nodded in agreement when she heard Feldway complaining.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The purpose of this operation was not to destroy El Dorado, but to bring the angelic skill owners before Feldway and add them to their ranks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was confused when she heard that Michael&#39;s &ldquo;control&rdquo; could be handled by Feldway. However, she believed that it was tactically correct to keep the generals out of the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, without any doubts, she accepted the current plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The plan was simple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone here, Feldway, Velzard, Zalario, Pico, Gracia, Kagali, Yuuki, Tear, Footman, Vega, Orlia, Arios, and Mai Furuki, thirteen in all, would go on a rampage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The idea was to slaughter those who rushed out to intercept them, while searching for the angelic skill users.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although it was a guess, and not a definite one, Kagali was sure that it was Leon. Even if she was wrong there would be no problem. The mission would be over as soon as the target was taken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they didn&#39;t come out to defend the city, Kagali and her team were going to go in as an assault team.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, as soon as they had arrived at the site through Mai&#39;s &lsquo;Instantaneous Movement,&rsquo; Vega went berserk, ignoring all instructions. He struck at the city&#39;s defense barriers and destroyed them. He then charged straight into the place that appeared to be the royal castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was dumbfounded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">He&rsquo;s even dumber than before now that he&#39;s got more power. We can&#39;t incorporate him into our operations at this rate, we might as well seriously consider a purge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violation of orders was strictly forbidden in any organization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, if it was an executive who did it, it might eventually become a matter of not being able to control the military discipline. To make an example of the subordinates, they might have to think about how to handle Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, the operation had already started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali decided to discuss the plan with Feldway, leaving Vega to be dealt with upon their return.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Myself and Velzard would be a perfect diversion, but Zalario, Pico and Gracia, should stay here. I&#39;ll put the rest under your command, so you can run wild and find the people you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear and Footman, not to mention Arios, Orlia, Mai, and the rest of the undead elf resurrection team, were under the influence of Kagali&#39;s spell. The orders were not compulsory, but they were connected by &lsquo;telekinesis.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, planning strategies was Kagali&#39;s forte. Feldway recognized this and had given her command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, Kagali gave the order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Vega will be reprimanded for his outburst later, but for now, hit the enemy with all your might. If you can&#39;t win, I&#39;ll allow you to retreat, so go ahead and go wild!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the exception of Yuuki, all of them there had gained a great deal of power. They at least had more self-control than Vega, but were still eager to see how strong they had become.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why, as soon as Kagali gave the go-ahead, they all started moving at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Kagali, alone, followed behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I have free will and have been given a certain amount of authority. I might not get any more opportunities in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Perhaps she should wait for a better time. Such a thought crossed her mind, but she was terrified that Michael was in control of her will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If she were to be turned into a complete puppet, all hope would be lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not unlikely that this was her last chance. Optimism was a dangerous thing, and Kagali decided to take action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From the very beginning, she had no intention of being loyal to Feldway and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael and Feldway were crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their insanity was so palpable that Kagali was convinced that a future with them was not bright.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I swear I will not betray you. And I will accept your dominion.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali had sworn that she would never betray her friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if that meant accepting Michael&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And she was prepared to repay the favor she had received from Yuuki, no matter how dirty her hands would become.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Michael&#39;s control seems to be absolute within a certain range. However, it might be less effective if the distance is increased. Or, if we isolate ourselves from the same space, we might not be affected at all!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They could look for signs of the other skill owners&rsquo; whereabouts. However, the locations of those three skills were still unknown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, there was a high possibility that it was a safe zone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ramiris&rsquo; Labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they could escape there, then there was a chance that Kagali and the others could be saved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fortunately, they were allied with Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, that&rsquo;s doubtful right now, but there was still a good chance that the good-natured Lord Rimuru would hide Kagali and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, the best course of action for Kagali and the others was to create a big mess here and find an opening to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For that reason&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Can you hear me, Laplace?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&mdash;Chairman!? You&#39;re all right!!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I&#39;m fine, but I&#39;m in a tricky situation. That&rsquo;s why&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Please order me to do anything you need. So, where should I go?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&mdash;It&rsquo;s El Dorado.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali called upon her most reliable trump card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, Laplace had joined the fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Leon&#39;s subordinates immediately became tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They had been training for what was to one day come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today, it was the real deal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t long before Leon had received a report that the city&#39;s defenses had been breached and that they were currently being invaded by the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a follow-up report, a bleeding knight shouted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There are only eight intruders, but their strength is enormous! They have already entered the city, and we are in chaos!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon turned to Guy, seeing off the knight who returned to intercept.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you contacted Rimuru?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Damn, we&#39;re being cut off. She&rsquo;s up there. Velzard. Which means that there&#39;s more than eight of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if he had been the enemy, he would move first to break the enemy&#39;s link. This, of course, was to be expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, as a countermeasure against such a situation, Rimuru was also keeping track of the situation of each force with the monitoring magic &lsquo;Argos.&rsquo; There would be a bit of a time lag, but he would know if something was wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Help was bound to come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides&hellip;Even if they didn&#39;t make it in time and things went horribly wrong, there was still the plan that Rimuru had jokingly mentioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It might not have been serious, and Leon would probably want to reject it, but in a serious situation, there would be no time to argue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In any case, he thought that he should probably do his best to prevent that from happening right now, so Leon asked Guy,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you say, should we wait here until Rimuru and the others arrive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, that would be difficult. If it weren&#39;t for Velzard, we&#39;d be fine. If she gets serious, this place could easily disappear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;That&#39;s not good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using &lsquo;Spatial Transportation&rsquo; required the exact coordinates of the current location and the travel destination. If they had been cut off, it was safe to assume that the enemy had taken such spatial measures into account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If the &lsquo;magic transfer circle&rsquo; is destroyed, then the arrival of reinforcements will be delayed even more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we can buy a dozen minutes of time, Rimuru should arrive by then. In order to hope for that, they would have to defend this base.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right? Then I guess I&#39;ll just have to go out there and deal with her.&rdquo; Guy said, standing up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will go with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m going to take it seriously today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mizari and Rain followed Guy&#39;s lead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The abilities of these two people had already been grasped after living together for the past few months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In particular, Rain&#39;s skills were improving rapidly, to the point that Leon began having a hard time with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Normally, that would be annoying, but now that she was on their side, it felt reliable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mizari complained that she wished she could always take it seriously, but that one comment summed up everyone&rsquo;s feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, another annoying person interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kufufufu. You two weaklings won&#39;t be of much use if you follow us. I&#39;m unwilling to help Guy, but I respect Rimuru-sama&#39;s orders. I&#39;ll help you, so let&rsquo;s go together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;You should thank me for helping you,&rsquo; that man, Diablo, laughs out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain is repulsed by this and starts to argue with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy yells at them in a disgusted tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mizari shakes her head in exasperation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;They must be close,&rsquo; Leon thought, as he watched them leave in a loud racket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, there was no time to think about such things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy and the others would take care of things outside, and Leon would have to do his part.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The screams of his men could be heard from the corridor, and it was clear that the situation was bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He could not move carelessly, for he was in danger of being dominated. It was frustrating for Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No one is headed for the city, are they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asked his trusted ally, Silver Knight Alrose, who was always at his side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose, who had been communicating with the knights on the &lsquo;Telepathy Net,&rsquo; replied succinctly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha! It seems that they are all trying to get in the castle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So they were piling in. Leon nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In that case, have the Magic Knights seal off the castle! Isolate the intruders inside the castle and do not allow them to communicate with the outside world!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dismissing Guy&#39;s concerns as irrelevant, Leon skipped to the instructions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they could contain the enemy inside the castle, then there would be no damage to the city below. He would then wait for support from Rimuru and take out the isolated enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To prevent further damage, each Knight Commander must intercept the enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After sealing the castle with the isolation barriers, he sent the knight commanders to intercept the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was the deployment of their reserve forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The maintenance of the city defense barriers was left to the Yellow Knights, who specialized in defense, and the White Knights, who specialized in recovery. The offensive Red Knights were dispatched to intercept the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only remaining force was the Blue Knights who specialized in raiding. Depending on the situation, they would cover the weak points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose took charge as Leon gave out commands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Leon, the six pillars knelt down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Demon Lord Leon-sama. Give us permission to go out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were the demon generals under Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not Guy, to be exact, but Mizari and Rain&#39;s subordinates.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They used to be archdemons, but when Mizari and the others evolved, they became &ldquo;demon peers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Among them, Misora, the leader of Rain&#39;s subordinates, was a duke-class demon because of her hard work. Although she was weaker than Moss, who was also a duke, she possessed an outstanding fighting ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kahn, the leader of Mizari&#39;s subordinates, was also no slouch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Although he was inferior to Misora in terms of combat ability, he was a powerful demon worthy of the rank of marquis.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt101" id="ftnt_ref101">[101]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The other four pillars were as strong as the leaders of the Magic Knights. It was a shame to keep them idle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Permission granted. Go. Work with Fran and the others to defeat the enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the demons were also unleashed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only ones standing by Leon&#39;s side were Commander Alrose and the Black Knight Claude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he could, he would have wanted to send these two to intercept the enemy as well. However, because the enemy&#39;s goal this time was Leon, they had to leave an escort here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s frustrating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please be patient. While it&rsquo;s strange that I am protecting Leon-sama, we must trust everyone here and stay put.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufufu. There are eight enemies in the castle. In addition to the four knight captains, there are those demons. And there are also highly trained knights. There is no way we will be defeated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Claude admonished Leon, Alrose expressed his optimism as if to encourage himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He knew it would not be easy, but he had to prevent Leon from falling into the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They decided to be patient and wait for good news in the throne room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a while, violent tremors could be heard throughout the castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fiercest battleground was the battlefield where Vega was rampaging.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Misora was in command, and the demons were stalling for time with the four pillars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Supporting them was the White Knight Maetel, the leader of the White Knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Maetel was a blond-haired, blue-eyed beauty. Her specialty was restoration magic, and her presence alone enhanced their ability to fight on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The demons were taking advantage of this and were fighting well against Vega.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, it was a good fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One by one, they would leave the battlefield, and Maetel would heal them and bring them back. This happened repeatedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the face of such overwhelming violence, there was no choice but to throw themselves into the fray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Misora&#39;s face is distorted with pain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But she was undeterred.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was always being tormented by the recklessness of her master, Rain, time and time again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And besides&hellip;If the demons retreated here, Guy would purge them. So they would fight proudly and fulfill their duties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&hellip;Vega&#39;s existence value was over 10 million, while the demons, even the upper ranks, were only about 500,000. Even Misora was only about 700,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They did not possess an Ultimate Skill, and the difference in strength was obvious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gahhahaha! Weak, weak you&rsquo;re too weak!!&mdash;No!! I&#39;m too strong. I&#39;m just too strong. Sorry to say, but you&rsquo;re too weak to even think about eating, so you&rsquo;ll be suffering for a long time. You must hate your weakness!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They had no choice but to calmly deal with Vega, who was spouting off abusive tirades, trampling on the demons&#39; pride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, that was the demons&rsquo; strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were good at reading emotions, and were taking advantage of Vega&#39;s personality. By letting Vega rampage comfortably, they were able to maintain the stalemate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unlike the fierce yet stable battle against Vega, Arios&rsquo; opponents were surrounded by a tense atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hyaahahaha! I can kill all I want!! What the hell, this power is awesome!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Intoxicated by the violence, Arios was rampaging as if he had lost his reason from when he was human.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Punishment King (Sandalphon)&rsquo; was embodied as a pistol that could shoot as much as Arios wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">There was also a bastard sword</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt102" id="ftnt_ref102">[102]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;in his right hand. This was a weapon created by Orlia&#39;s &lsquo;Multiple Weapons.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These two weapons were far more powerful than a simple mythical-grade weapons. By using these weapons, Arios was able to slaughter the knights. He looked like an imitation of Lieutenant Kondou, but this was a sign of &ldquo;admiration&rdquo; that even Arios himself would not admit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The leader of the Blue Knights, the Bleu Knight Oxian, and Kahn teamed up to challenge Arios.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The difference in weaponry could not be bridged, but it was fortunate that their skills (level) were on par. Kahn used his pride as a great demon to interfere with Arios with his magic, and Oxian used his brilliant swordsmanship to confront Arios.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that Oxian was good at auxiliary magic was also significant. His physical strength and the durability of his sword were compensated for by the multiple layers of Kahn&#39;s and Oxian&#39;s magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, the chances of victory were almost zero. Oxian, a nihilistic nobleman, did not want to win against an opponent who would not be injured by a direct hit. He was conscious of the fact that his sword would not be broken, and was trying to make this battle last as long as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He did not want the enemy to reach his beloved Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The daunting battle had only just begun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Red Knight Fran and the Yellow Knight Kizona, the commanders of the Red and Yellow Knights, respectively, were fighting against Orlia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fran was a healthy, auburn-skinned beauty, lightly armed and focused on offensive power. Kizona was small in stature but cheerful in disposition, and wore heavy full-body armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fortunately for these two women, Orlia had a lack of fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Orlia was cautious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unlike Vega and Arios, she was cautious about her skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Fran and Orlia were the worst match-up. All of her magic had fallen before Orlia&#39;s shield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Orlia experimented with her &lsquo;Multiple Weapons&rsquo; to see what weapons she could create. She gave Arios a bastard sword, and Mai a crescent bow.

But what am I supposed to do? Tell me, Yuuki-kun&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai was at a loss, troubled, and unable to find an answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She still needed some time before she could make a move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">*** </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy and the others went to intercept her, but there was a blizzard outside the castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Velzard&#39;s work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll deal with her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy&#39;s words were met with no objections from anyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had fought Velzard several times before, both long ago and recently, and she was clearly very strong. Inevitably, Guy would have to be the one to face Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, the current Velzard wasn&#39;t holding back her power. The evidence was that she had changed from a girl to a grown woman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And her eyes were not the usual deep-sea blue diamond hues, but were golden. They shone with a mysterious, evil, and shining light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was Velzard&#39;s true form, her human battle form. Seeing this, Guy realized that she was serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Velzard was going crazy with emotion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When he flew up to Velzard, who was stationary in the sky and at the center of the blizzard, Velzard saw Guy and shouted happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I love, love, love you, Guy. So&mdash;you should also kill (love) me more and more and more!!&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt105" id="ftnt_ref105">[105]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She then challenged Guy with a big smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Che, that&rsquo;s why I said these things were troublesome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy was also fighting back seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be suicide to go easy on Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, in the skies above the castle, a battle broke out between the strongest forces in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guy was strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His existence value was so high that it almost reached 40 million.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Velzard was different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Velzard was more than twice as powerful as Guy and had unimaginable power. She was not just the sister of the Creator, she was the most absolute on earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Velzard had never been serious, even when dealing with her sister, Velgrynd. She always responded in the form of a girl, that is to say, with her own power blocked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even when she wiped out Veldora, she had only dealt a playful blow. This meant that her attacks were very energy efficient.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only time she got serious was when she took on Guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only reason Guy was able to fight her on even terms was because of his superior combat ability. On top of that, he always tried his best to keep the ground as unaffected as possible, so one could understand how terrifying a man like Guy Crimson was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle, as always, lead to a stalemate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then Guy realized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This person wasn&rsquo;t being controlled after all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, she was being controlled, but it seemed to be the result of not daring to resist, because it was in line with Velzard&#39;s wishes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Velzard seemed to be very happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a very familiar look that could only be seen in the midst of battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather than good news, this was a disappointing fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A long-repressed desire that had been suppressed for so many years, only to be unleashed because of Feldway and the others. That means that this relationship would not improve until Velzard was convinced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If she was only being controlled, it would have been enough to release it. But since she wasn&#39;t, there was nothing Guy could do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Velzard wasn&rsquo;t the kind of person who responded to persuasion. The only way to bring her to her senses was for Guy to stay with her until she was satisfied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good grief, man!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While complaining about this, Guy fearlessly sneered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then he happily intercepted Velzard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Above the castle, even higher than Velzard and the others&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Standing in front of Feldway and Zalario was Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Evil demon who does not know your place, you dare to challenge us alone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kufufufu. You told me to be prepared the next time I saw you, but are you going to entertain me today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Damn it. I don&#39;t have time to play with the likes of you. Zalario, I&rsquo;ll let you deal with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway avoided a fight with Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo was a troublesome demon. Knowing this well, he hesitated to deal with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway left the castle without saying a word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo thought about interfering, but Zalario would not allow it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was annoyed at being pushed around, and frankly speaking, he wanted to refuse. However, since it was an order from his immediate superior, he decided that he had no choice but to accept the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. Now that you have acquired the name Diablo, let&#39;s see how strong you&#39;ve become.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, the two sides went into battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario, though reluctant, was confident.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had just been incarnated, but his body was in good condition. It had been a long time since he had exerted himself to the fullest, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be broken down, and that lifted Zalario&#39;s spirits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dark Eight Palms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario took the initiative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a very simple technique that involved putting magical energy into the palm of one&#39;s hand, but its power was immeasurable. Eight separate energy projectiles were flying towards Diablo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Worthless. So that&#39;s the extent of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo, on the other hand, muttered in a bored tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not a strategy to stir up trouble or to make himself look good, but his true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you are dealing with a lower-ranked opponent, or even a competitor, you have to be very careful about what you do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Diablo lightly evaded the projectiles and glared at Zalario.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you just an amateur with a lot of power, wasting your energy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asked this quite seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario was annoyed by this, but kept his cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;This is why I hate this guy&rsquo;&mdash;He replied while hiding his anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up. That was nothing for me. In the first place, you and I are different in terms of the absolute amount of power we contain. You should worry more about yourself, not me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was a fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario&#39;s conditions were now different from when he had invaded Ramiris&#39; labyrinth. Now that he had a physical body, he was able to fully exercise the power of his main body in the Palace of Monsters. With an existence value of over 20 million, he was confident that he would not be defeated even by a True Dragon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no need to worry about wasting a bit of energy, as it would be quickly recovered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But only Diablo snickered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is why amateurs are no good. In our fight, we must either annihilate our opponent with a single blow or prepare for a long battle, you know? So, the basic rule is to focus on how to fight without being exhausted. If you can&rsquo;t even understand that, then Zalario, you&#39;ve been slacking off, haven&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zalario was annoyed by Diablo&#39;s superior attitude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;d put up with it if it was said after a loss, but the fight has only just begun. It might have been a tactic to disturb the opponent&#39;s mind, but Diablo was not aiming for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was sincerely and earnestly trying to give advice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that Zalario understood this made him even more annoyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up. Your advice is none of my business, so just shut up. Even if you weren&rsquo;t worried, I&rsquo;ve been fighting on the front lines against Insectars, the natural enemies of demons. You should know that someone like you who has been living comfortably on the surface is no match for me now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, that&#39;s very impressive. And don&#39;t worry. I, too, have fought to the death against Zegion-dono. Zegion-dono is also an insect-type majin (insectar), and a very strong one at that. Moreover, he has been given Rimuru-sama&#39;s cells, which are enviable, and has very few attackable parts. So, even for me, he is a difficult opponent to beat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The small number of attackable parts was a self-imposed rule that Diablo had set for himself. Diablo&#39;s own rule was that he would not target the parts made of Rimuru&#39;s cells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because of this rule, the three demon girls had also been unable to defeat Zegion&hellip;But that&rsquo;s another story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know what you mean, but no matter how much I train on this tepid ground&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then, Zalario suddenly remembered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He hadn&#39;t heard the name Zegion before, but it was familiar to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zegion was the name of the person that Dino had declared as troublesome and whom even Zelanus had expressed interest in. If he had been fighting to the death against someone like that instead of training&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see, it seems that this is no time to be playing around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, Zalario got serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle between Diablo and Zalario was about to begin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In front of Rain and Mizari stood Pico and Gracia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain&#39;s heart was already about to break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If she wasn&#39;t a demon, she would have run back to the fireplace by now&mdash;Rain was thinking about how to get out of this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rain&hellip;&hellip;You said earlier that you were going to get serious today, didn&#39;t you? So why do you look so unmotivated?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s a silly question, Mizari. It&#39;s because it&#39;s cold. Why should I have to fight in such cold weather, in a blizzard, against an opponent I don&rsquo;t even hate!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When asked by Mizari, Rain blurted out her true feelings without any intention of hiding them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What are you talking about?&rsquo;&mdash;is what a dumbfounded Mizari wanted to say, but surprisingly, someone else also agreed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Pico, who was supposed to be the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me about it! Why do I have to fight like this in a place like this where I can&#39;t even see from all this snow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, Pico also looked very cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So did Gracia, for that matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t complain. I&#39;m cold too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was trying to calm Pico down, but it was obvious that she felt the same way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain and Mizari were wearing maid outfits, but Pico and Gracia were only wearing thin clothes. Gracia, for example, was wearing a bare shoulder outfit that made her feel cold just looking at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Oh, perhaps I was the only one who was really trying to fight?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mizari was upset when she realized this shocking fact. Not caring about her, Rain and the others began hitting it off and started spilling their complaints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I mean, Velzard-sama, she really shouldn&rsquo;t be blowing snow everywhere all of a sudden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously, I agree. I mean, if she was going to do that, she should have told me in advance. &nbsp;Then I could have worn my favorite fur coat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That way I could brag about it,&rsquo; Pico said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hold on, Pico, when did you find the time to buy that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufufu, just a little in between work~&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah! That&rsquo;s the city from last time! That place was a special hole-in-the-wall.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was the Blumund Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a city where the West meets the East, goods from all over the world had begun to gather there. Naturally, there was also an influx of many domestic monster products, and some of the clothing was of a very high quality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pico and Gracia had been traveling around the world on a surveillance mission. They were Dino&#39;s companions, and seemed to be doing whatever they wanted. They had their own hideouts all over the world and enjoyed the latest fashion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain looks at them with an alert gaze as they chat like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s fine to boast. But first, don&#39;t you have some work to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mizari was surprised to hear that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Oh, as expected of Rain. Was her earlier comment intended to catch them off guard? I didn&#39;t realize that she was aiming to take advantage of them like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, in reconsideration of her colleague, she was quite impressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, Mizari waited for the signal to start fighting. However, what she heard next was a ridiculous proposal from Rain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Talking in a place like this is out of the question! Don&#39;t you think we should get out of the cold first?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, that&rsquo;s exactly what she said, going at her own pace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;!!&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The three others were surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The concept of enemy and ally had completely vanished, and only confusion remained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain didn&rsquo;t care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She quickly landed herself on the ground and activated a certain spell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Strategic Magic: Freezing Hell (Cocytus)!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hold on, Rain!

It was a magic with outstanding killing power that froze the moisture in the air and then broke everything up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, this time, Gracia manipulated it dexterously, and only hollowed out the cube of ice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And thus, the &ldquo;ice igloo&rdquo; was completed on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You did a good job.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, you too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rain and Gracia acknowledged each other, and a friendship was born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on, let&#39;s hurry and go inside!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pico was the first to go inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Without any hesitation, Rain and Gracia followed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mizari, who was left alone outside, was stunned and left muttering to herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, Rain? So, it wasn&#39;t a joke or a strategy, you were being serious&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the one who should be answering was inside the igloo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mizari began feeling like an idiot and hurried inside.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;So, the method was a secret, but we were given the honor of evolving at the hands of Rimuru-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was the answer to Gracia&#39;s question, &lsquo;By the way, you guys have gotten stronger than when I last saw you, haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;You&#39;ve been telling that much to the enemy&hellip;Okay, that&#39;s enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite Mizari&#39;s dismay, Rain had also been getting information from Pico and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems that the skills of Dino and Pico were under the control of Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pico has the ultimate skill &lsquo;Rigor King (Jibril),&rsquo; and Gracia has the ultimate skill &lsquo;Glory King (Haniel).&rsquo; Although they were not aware of it, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to disobey Michael&#39;s orders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition, she had also been told the full extent of the enemy forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The information given by Rain was not very important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was only the fact that she mentioned Rimuru&#39;s name without permission that was careless, but Rain judged had that it was okay because she had not specifically been told not to talk about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Rimuru heard this, he would be angry, and would probably lament that he should have kept his mouth shut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In any case, in exchange for the information that she was able to evolve thanks to Rimuru, Rain was able to get a very important story out of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From there, they were just complaining to each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They started talking about each other&rsquo;s hardships and complained about their bosses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, the four of them worked together to build a fire and poured magic power into it to keep the room at a comfortable temperature. On top of that, the sweet potatoes that Rain had hidden in the fire were being roasted on skewers, giving off a faintly delicious aroma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this point, Rain took out some sweet sake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is perfect for when it&#39;s cold.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You, you&rsquo;re not actually going to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, come now, Mizari-san, let&#39;s not be so formal. I think it&#39;s fine, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You just want to drink, don&#39;t you, Gracia? Well, I want to as well, so I won&#39;t stop you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right, Mizari. After a fight, you&rsquo;re supposed to drink to make up. It&#39;s called common sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When did we even fight?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But there was no one other than Mizari to intervene here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a three against one, the odds were really against her, so Mizari had no choice but to give in. Thus, the inside of the igloo became like a women&#39;s club.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the battle outside raged on, the girls continue to quietly exchange opinions&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon sat on his throne.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The time of peace was over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a loud bang, the front door was broken down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The great door leading to the audience room shattered into pieces, scattering debris like dust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And out of that dust, the intruder proudly emerged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hoohohoho. Good day, everyone! My name is Footman. Footman the &ldquo;Angry Pierrot&rdquo; of the Moderate Clown Troupe. Pleasure to make your acquaintance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With his fat body and angry clown face, he exuded a certain air of strangeness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon had met this clown once before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was now in remembrance of his own stupidity, a business partner with whom he had made a contract.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had felt a certain power when he met him before, but now it felt nothing like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He felt an uncanny power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What bothered him, though, was Footman&#39;s true purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he had wanted to capture Leon, it would be reckless for him to come alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">As I thought, the enemy&#39;s forces must have outnumbered ours. But I don&#39;t understand. What is he thinking? If he goes and helps the others, he would have the power to change the course of the war&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he pondered this, Leon left his seat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You come here alone and think you&#39;re going to make it out alive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose shouts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claude keeps his hand on his sword, ready to protect Leon at any moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This Footman must have some other purpose, or&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just as he was wondering about that, a woman steps through the broken door and into the audience room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, there you are, Demon Lord Leon.

I am Kagali. I&#39;m the chairman of the Moderate Clown Troupe. I&#39;ve got a grudge against you for killing me, so I guess I&#39;ll have to deal with you myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Needless to say, it was Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She greeted him, while somewhat over-acting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, two clowns followed Kagali, coming in one after the other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girl with the teary-eyed mask was Tear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was carrying a large sickle on her shoulder and greeted everyone in a playful manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m Tear. Tear the &ldquo;Teardrop&rdquo; of the Moderate Clown Troupe. I hate sadness. All of Kagali-sama&#39;s enemies will be eliminated by me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Tear declared as such, she began spinning her scythe dexterously and moved to her place as if dancing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stepping forward to take his place was Laplace, a man with an asymmetrical clown face that looked like he was playing a trick on someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m Laplace the &ldquo;Wonder Pierrot,&rdquo; vice-chairman of the Moderate Clown Troupe. Now then, everyone. It sure is a beautiful day today&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t care about that! I was told to &lsquo;dash here as fast as possible&rsquo; and now I&#39;m really tired. And it looks like we&#39;re in big trouble. I feel like I want to go home&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was very typical of Laplace to be complaining without saying hello.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as the clowns finished their speech, the last one showed up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A young boy wearing a black Imperial military uniform with a fearless smile on his face. It was Yuuki Kagurazaka, who was still under Michael&rsquo;s control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, I guess I&#39;m the last one. I hear my name is Yuuki. You&#39;re Demon Lord Leon, aren&#39;t you? I think we&#39;ve met before, but my memory&#39;s a little foggy. I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were different stages to Michael&#39;s domination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were cases where the victim retained some of their free will, and cases where they were more restricted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the case of control over the angelic skills, there was no fear of betrayal, so they were allowed to behave quite freely. However, Yuuki was being controlled by the &ldquo;Regalia Dominion&rdquo; and was therefore restricted to a greater extent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a sense, this was evidence that Michael acknowledged Yuuki. If he had recognized Yuuki as a lower rank, he would have allowed him to act freely like Kagali and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway, the current Yuuki was somewhat vague, and as soon as he finished introducing himself, he lost interest in Leon and the others, and stood there leaning against the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Hmmm&hellip;&rsquo; Leon assessed the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were five of them total, but each one of them was as strong as him. No, they seemed to have more strength than that. Since he was outnumbered, the situation had become the worst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon couldn&#39;t decide whether or not to make a move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He might be able to defeat at least one of them, but this was not the time to make a desperate attempt. If he couldn&#39;t win, he should run away, and he had the means to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Leon was also at a loss because he saw a light of reason, not madness, in Kagali&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had been told by Rimuru that Kagali was the Demon Lord Kazaream. He had almost forgotten about her, but he remembered clearly those eyes full of madness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali would say that she had been jealous, but to Leon, it was a horrifying look. And yet, now, those eyes were as beautiful as a lapis lazuli.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">She&#39;s not a different person. So, there may be something else going on. And does that mean there&rsquo;s room for negotiation?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In spite of the situation, Leon understood the circumstances of the other party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In front of such a Leon, the clowns continued their speeches.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Demon Lord Leon. You are not only responsible for the destruction of Kazaream-sama, but also for the murder of our brother and friend, Clayman, the &ldquo;Crazy Clown!&rdquo; I won&#39;t make it easy for you. Because I&#39;m angry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And with that, Footman bent his fat body in a dexterous bow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace followed suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. That idiot Clayman didn&#39;t become a demon lord because he wanted to. He was just the only one suited for it, so we sent him out as a replacement in case something happened to the Chairman. I regret it so much that it turned out like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His voice sounded sad, as if he was remembering Clayman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s really sad, isn&#39;t it? But Kagali-sama gave us a chance for revenge! I&#39;m going to give you the full force of our grudge, so stay with me until the end!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear added sadly at the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then battle began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Leon&rsquo;s side there were three people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Kagali&#39;s group had five.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Yuuki was not moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear headed to Alrose, and Claude took on Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were only two people left, but of course, Leon would have to deal with them himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Under normal circumstances, defeat would have been inevitable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, that was not the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Leon drew out his Flame Pillar, Kagali struck him with the Ruin Scepter borrowed from Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The impact of the mythical-grade weapon collision sent shock waves throughout the hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the same time, Leon heard a voice in his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Can you hear me? I want to negotiate.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His prediction was correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;&rsquo; Leon nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Thank you. I&#39;ve got eyes on me. That&#39;s why I&rsquo;m acting with that in mind. No matter how careful I am, it can never be enough.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You&#39;re right,&rdquo; said Leon with a look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The conversation was like a tightrope walk, with both sides playing out a fierce battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, Laplace&#39;s role was to relay the &lsquo;thoughts.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Through the master-slave connection between Kagali and Laplace, encrypted information was being transmitted. Kagali sent the information to Laplace, and then retransmitted it to Leon. The reply from Leon was also encrypted and transmitted to Kagali through Laplace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason for using this particular method was to prevent Michael from reading her mind. Believing that not all of her thoughts could be read, she put up multiple barriers in the back of her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason she was so wary was because Kagali was about to betray Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali had once been trapped in a grudge against Leon, but now that she was away from Michael, she had regained her composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a result, she decided that it would be best to join forces with Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As long as she could get to Ramiris&#39; labyrinth, she could escape Michael&#39;s surveillance. And that mysterious slime would free Kagali and the others by any means necessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Anyway, didn&rsquo;t you prepare some kind of connection passageway in case of emergency? I can&#39;t get to the labyrinth with magic, so if there is on, let me use it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was also transfer magic, but that was a gamble. If she did any unplanned actions, Michael might tighten his control over her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ideally, she wanted to evacuate directly to the labyrinth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If that was not possible, Kagali wanted them to be prepared to receive her and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I see, I understand your situation.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m just taking some time, but you&#39;re the one Michael wants, right? You have the &lsquo;Purity King,&rsquo; don&#39;t you&hellip;?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&hellip;I won&#39;t deny it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon admitted that there was no point in hiding it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The moment they attacked this country, he judged that the owner of the skill was already known.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, the words of Kagali and the others became more credible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With such a large difference in strength, there was no point in extracting information from Leon. They could simply disable Leon and take him to Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, while Tear and Footman were rampaging wildly, Alrose and Claude were still unharmed. If they really wanted to kill them, they would have been dead by now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this situation, there was no point in acting like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why he could be sure that Kagali&#39;s words were true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I believe you. There is indeed a magic transfer circle in this castle that leads to Ramiris&rsquo; labyrinth.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I knew it!&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s expression brightened as she realized that her plan was now more likely to succeed. Then, while crossing blades fiercely, she threw herself forward and enthusiastically engaged in negotiations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon, who had given up his suspicion of Kagali, wondered if he should simply nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, what came to his mind was Chloe&rsquo;s smile, the girl Leon loves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For some reason, that smile was not looking upon Leon&#39;s face, but on Rimuru&rsquo;s&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From the depths of Leon&rsquo;s heart, dark emotions began to well up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is not jealousy. Absolutely not!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon swallowed his feelings and endured it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Rimuru would accept these people. It wouldn&#39;t hurt my conscience too much to put them through the trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon felt a little better, as if he didn&#39;t have to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He nodded his head and began to confirm the arrangements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;So, are you sure it&#39;s just the five of you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Yes. There are other people who used to work for Yuuki-sama, but I don&#39;t trust them. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re going to kill us if we leave them here, and there&#39;s no point in holding them hostage against us, so we&#39;re going to leave them behind.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Wouldn&#39;t it be better to take them with you, to reduce the enemy&#39;s strength?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon was surprisingly kind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The reason why he is misunderstood and gives off a cold impression is because he is clumsy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali sensed that too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;You&#39;re not what I thought you were. You didn&#39;t take it easy on me when I was your age&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be helped. With a demon lord attacking, I couldn&rsquo;t afford to be calm either. I didn&#39;t want to prolong the battle and cause civilian casualties.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She understood what he meant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If two demon lords of equal ability fought each other, the damage to the surrounding area would be extensive. In order to prevent that, the best option would be to aim for a short-term decisive battle like Leon had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;That&#39;s true. Besides, I was a fool back then, so I have no right to complain. Forget it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon was caught off guard by Kagali&#39;s reaction, because he had expected her to complain more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;&mdash;You&#39;ve really changed.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that said, he muddled his words, changed his mind and resumed the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;The &ldquo;magic transfer circle&rdquo; is located behind this room. This room itself is heavily guarded by a &lsquo;Multilayer Barrier,&rsquo; so it&#39;s just a matter of opening the hidden door behind the throne.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Thank you. So, what are you going to do?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael&#39;s goal was to get Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;We should run away together,&rsquo; Kagali implied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s answer, however, was clear and without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;I am staying. If I was going to run away, I would have gone to Rimuru from the beginning.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Michael&#39;s rule is absolute, you know?&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;However, there are also conditions. Worst case scenario, even if I were to be controlled, Guy could observe the process and come up with a way to deal with it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was just one of the reasons, not all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon was really just trying to protect the people here in El Dorado with his own hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was the true intention of Leon Cromwell, the man who gave up being a Chosen Hero in order to protect the mixed races of human and demon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;You really are a clumsy guy. For the sake of others, you&rsquo;re willing to throw yourself away&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hm, that&rsquo;s not the case. There are few people as vicious as I am. I tolerated the sacrifice of others because I wished to save the only one I loved. I will be the one to pay for it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These words showed Leon&#39;s resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali understood this and decided to respect Leon&#39;s wishes. She had her own priorities, and there was no need to try to persuade him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And so, the decision was made.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali also informed Tear and Footman about the situation through Laplace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon, on the other hand, had been talking to Alrose and Claude. Both of them felt that the enemy was not serious, so they were convinced by Leon&#39;s explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only thing left to do was to force Yuuki to go with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon gave Kagali a look. In the direction of his gaze, there was a hidden door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Understanding his intent, Kagali pretended to be blown away and destroyed the door. Seeing this, Laplace signaled to Footman and Tear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose and the others helped in the act, and Footman and Tear also flew to the hidden room as if they were excessively blown away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yuuki-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, well, I guess it&rsquo;s my turn, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, Yuuki leisurely made his way to the hidden room&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Okay! Now all I have to do is get Leon to activate the magic circle!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was sure of their success.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been a tightrope walk, but now she could escape from Michael.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s how it was supposed to be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was here that fate had given up on Kagali and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael, who was still in the Heavenly Star Palace, had discovered Obera&#39;s betrayal before Dino could report it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael was furious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was the first time in his life that he had experienced this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was furious that something had gone wrong with his plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cause, as it turned out, was his own naivete.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In spite of his immense control of power, he had allowed himself to be led astray by trusting in the uncertainties of his companions, and this was the result.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obera had received the &lsquo;Salvation King (Azrael),&rsquo; and Michael knew it. At that point, he should have made sure of his domination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Michael&#39;s mistake not to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he made a mistake, he&rsquo;d have to make it up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michael was furious, but calmly thought as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a result, he reinforced his control over the Angelic skill owners currently under his control with the &ldquo;Ultimate Dominion&rdquo; via Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a result, Kagali&#39;s ego was also taken away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just one more step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That step felt so far away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway emerged from the broken door that led to the audience room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was curious, but I didn&#39;t realize you were planning to betray me. All of you are fools who do not understand my cause!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seeing Feldway screaming in rage, Kagali knew that the plan had failed. At the very least, she should try to let Laplace and the others escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All it would take was a single command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet, she was unable to utter a word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s useless. The &lsquo;Ultimate Dominion&rsquo; has taken complete control over you. Michael-sama is also angry. I let you do whatever you want. And then there&#39;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway&#39;s cold stare pierced Leon, who had stopped moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It looks like our target was here as well. You, too, will be a loyal servant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Leon could even listen to those words, he had activated &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron)&rsquo; at full force. He was about to unleash a godlike blow with the desperate intent to kill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Shit, I can&#39;t fight this&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Loyalty towards Michael, whom he had never even met, began to well up as if overflowing from the depths of his heart. Leon&#39;s memories and knowledge remained intact, but his ego was being filled with ecstatic feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Chloe, I&mdash;!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The smile of the girl he loves, etched into his mind, was being overwritten by an irresistible elation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the same way as Leon, Kagali&#39;s heart had also being stolen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her loyalty to Michael outweighed her feelings for her dear friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I&#39;m always so naive&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali lamented in a terribly sad mood, but even that regret quickly disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chairman, you can&rsquo;t just give up now! I&mdash;I believe in you&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali heard a voice that confused her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it sounded like the voice of a child screaming through multiple layers of glass, and could not be heard clearly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kagali, does the spell not work on him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Laplace is special, so he doesn&#39;t have to follow my orders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. Then he is unnecessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A cold voice that seemed to have lost all emotion was transmitted to Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. You&#39;ve been through a lot, Laplace. At the very least, I will take care of you with my own hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wai&mdash;Chairman!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace was the only one who was confused by Kagali&#39;s change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear, Footman, Yuuki, and even their former enemy, Leon, were all ready to watch as if it was a matter of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali&#39;s Ruin Scepter glowed in gold&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t just sit here!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace was about to give up on everything when a figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere and pushed him away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The person then flicked the destructive golden ray with her sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who the hell are you!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t have time for formalities. But I&#39;ll tell you anyway. I am Silvia. I&#39;m a very strong helper, so don&#39;t worry and leave this to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was beautiful woman with long and braided greenish silver hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The thin dress with a silky sheen was made of a special material from the Monster Kingdom that could be used in battle. Her milky-white legs glimpsed through the slit. But if you looked closely, you could see that she was also wearing denim shorts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It might have been intended as a precaution in the event of a fierce battle, but if that was the case, why not wear pants in the first place?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her fashion sense was the embodiment of selfishness, showing her strong will to not give up fashion. Even from that one thing, he was able to catch a glimpse of her personality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The woman called herself Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was Leon&#39;s master, the one who had been called upon as a trump card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace felt nostalgic when he saw Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace was an undead elf created by Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Perhaps it was because he had been a Chosen Hero before his death, but although he was never controlled by Kagali, almost all of his memories had been lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why he did not remember that his real name was Sarion Grimwald, nor did he realize that Silvia, the woman who had just saved him, was his wife.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, he instinctively knew that Silvia was an important person for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m a real man. I don&#39;t want to be so pathetic as to leave this place to you all alone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace was back on his feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was such a sudden turn of events that it had made it difficult for him to grasp the situation, but that was always the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, as always, he would just have to get out of this situation no matter what.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You guys, if you&#39;re still alive, then get out of here. You look like you&#39;ve been beaten to a pulp by Tear and Footman, and you might die, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Keeping his eyes fixed on Kagali and Yuuki, he called out to Alrose and Claude, who were lying in the corner of the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They had managed to endure with recovery medicine, but the contents of their space-expanding waist bags were almost completely used up. At this rate, they would not be able to escape, yet they still snickered at Laplace&#39;s call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve taught my students never to run away in times of trouble. If I don&#39;t set a good example, then no one will follow me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufu, a knight should never abandon his master and run away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Both of them understood that they were already a liability, not an asset. Still, they did not run away because they were ready to give up their lives for Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Believing that Rimuru and the others would soon come to support them, they decided to buy time even at the cost of their own lives.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You guys are idiots.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha! I never thought I&#39;d be praised by a clown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Claude-dono, I don&#39;t think that&rsquo;s a compliment. But I do envy you that you can still laugh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a small smile on Alrose&#39;s face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Those who are determined are strong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace thought to himself, &lsquo;I also can&rsquo;t lose.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&#39;s start over. If we kill him, the Chairman will be back to normal, right? I&#39;ll do my best, too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He said so, while glaring at Feldway. He suspected that Feldway was up to something, even more than Michael who was not present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, the battle resumed in the audience room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On one side were Laplace, Silvia, and the two injured knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Against them were Feldway, Kagali, Leon, Yuuki, Footman and Tear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were outnumbered four to six and were overwhelmingly disadvantaged in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Silvia-san</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt106" id="ftnt_ref106">[106]</a></sup><span class="c0">, can I ask you something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Honestly, how far do you think we can go against them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm, yes, well&hellip;&hellip;even if I tell you, it won&rsquo;t make you happy, will it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess so. Wait, don&#39;t answer that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s certainly true,&rsquo; Laplace laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia felt nostalgic about the exchange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, it wasn&#39;t the conversation, but the very existence of this man, Laplace, that made her feel nostalgic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Could it be that we know each other? No, I don&#39;t think so. Well, whatever. This is not the time to be worrying about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia, with her modest yet graceful chest, was undoubtedly a warrior. She quickly switched her mind and identified the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway did not move, as if wanting to leave the work to his subordinates.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was obvious from his attitude that he was looking down on Silvia and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, in the current situation where she was at an overwhelming disadvantage, perhaps she should be grateful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">I&#39;d like to say that his arrogance will be his downfall, but he&#39;s the head of the &lsquo;Primordials</span><sup class="c9 c20"><a href="#ftnt107" id="ftnt_ref107">[107]</a></sup><span class="c7 c5">.&rsquo; I&#39;ve heard from the ancestor, but this is crazy. He&rsquo;s stronger than me, to be honest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ancestor always had a sloppy personality, so it had always been best to take everything he said with a grain of salt. Silvia had also been deceived many times and suffered a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, judging from the activities of the Primordials, she never thought they were weak. Even if she only knew half the story, they should be considered as superior to Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, when confronting them in this way, she could sense that their presence was frighteningly dense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, all the people here are monsters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Alrose and Claude are good enough to be called demon lords in their time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Among them, Feldway was exceptional.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If she fought him head-on, she would be defeated. Therefore, the only strategy to be taken here was to buy time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Rimuru-kun, who El-chan</span><sup class="c9 c20"><a href="#ftnt108" id="ftnt_ref108">[108]</a></sup><span class="c7 c5">&nbsp;mentioned, will be here soon, right? I don&#39;t know how well he&rsquo;ll do against such monsters, but he&rsquo;s already defeated Velgrynd, right? Well, we can only hope for the best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Silvia was also one of the high-elves created by the ancestor, and she was proud of her abilities. In fact, she had an existential value of just under two million, which was about the same as that of an awakened demon lord. In addition to that, her weapon was a mythical-grade Vajra</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt109" id="ftnt_ref109">[109]</a></sup><span class="c0">, which surpassed Leon&#39;s in terms of skill. The number of blades was variable, and she specialized in handling it by stretching it like a spear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, she possessed the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Thunder King (Indra),&rsquo; the highest of the weather system skills, which made her stronger than Tear and Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even still, she was not as strong as Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was not even close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite her confident assurances to Laplace, it would be difficult to turn the tables. However, as long as Feldway didn&#39;t make a move, there was still a chance to win.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The possibility of Leon being manipulated had also been taken into consideration. She had told him how to separate his mind from his Skill, and believed that Leon was still desperately trying to regain his ego.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incidentally, if he did this, there was a very high possibility that he would lose his Skill. This is exactly what Obera did, and it would be a huge loss in terms of strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, it was not that easy, so she taught it to him as a last resort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Well, it&rsquo;s all up to Leon-kun. He was a very good pupil, but I think it&#39;s still a 50/50 chance whether or not he will succeed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was not very optimistic, but there was still hope that Leon would return to the front.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a pretty bad wager to find a way out of it, but there was no other way. If there was nothing she could do but complain, then she would just have to be prepared and do her best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You two, stick to supporting me! And the clown (Pierrot) over there! Your opponent is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. If I don&#39;t work once in a while, I&#39;ll lose my reputation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia&#39;s comment was interrupted by Yuuki, one of the enemies. Without saying a word, he launched a kick at Laplace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh, Wait!! Are you serious, boss!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace, even when starting the battle with no questions asked, did not forget to introduce himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am a clown, but my name is Laplace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While dealing with Yuuki, he shouted it back at Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re still dangerous, Laplace. There&#39;s still plenty left in you, so I&#39;ll be your opponent as well as Yuuki-sama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While saying that, Kagali joined the fray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s not fair! I mean, are you trying to make me cry!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Laplace had become desperate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if it was just one of them, it would be difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But now that both of them were coming at him at the same time, he couldn&#39;t even afford to make fun of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this point, Leon made his move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it looks like you&#39;re my opponent, Master Silvia. But I don&#39;t want to point my sword at you. Won&rsquo;t you come to our side?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon made such a suggestion in a gentlemanly manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though he was being manipulated, his memories were still intact. If Michael or Feldway ordered him to kill, there was nothing he could do, but otherwise, he could get some control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, betrayal is absolutely impossible. Simply asking this proposal was the best concession Leon could currently make.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, Leon-kun. You were the one called me here, remember?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. So, by all means, become an ally&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t think we should talk. Because I don&#39;t want Leon-kun to resent me. If I cooperate with Leon-kun now, he&#39;ll complain about it later when he comes to his senses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia laughed in reply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew what Leon&#39;s purpose was in life, and what he had lived for. That is why she could not betray Leon&#39;s true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, Leon could not understand his feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon also had memories of Chloe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He still felt that Chloe was important to him, but that did not take precedence over his &ldquo;orders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have a girl you like, don&#39;t you? How do you think she&rsquo;d feel if she saw Leon-kun right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s heart wavered when he was asked that question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He quickly calmed down and regained his usual coolness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s a silly question. After Feldway-sama&#39;s wish is granted, I will have what I want. And I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be waiting for me until then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, are you sure about that&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia asked quite seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Based on what she had heard from Elmesia and the others, It was clear that Chloe&#39;s attention was not on Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Leon didn&rsquo;t launch an onslaught from here on, she didn&rsquo;t think Chloe would be waiting for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But that was Leon&#39;s own problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not for her to interfere with, so all Silvia said was, &ldquo;Oh well. Just don&rsquo;t cry if she rejects you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Leon heard this, he twitched, but no one noticed it. And so, the battle between Silvia and Leon began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace was the strongest majin in the Moderate Clown Troupe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He possessed a vicious power and could even be called an uncrowned demon lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was reborn as an undead elf by Kagali&#39;s hands, but his experience and abilities as an ex-Chosen Hero had remained intact. In addition to that, Laplace possessed two Unique Skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first was the Unique Skill &lsquo;Falsifier.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This ability, which was able to interfere with an opponent&#39;s perceptions, helped him to launch illusionary attacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Disguising one&rsquo;s weapon is a useful skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A spear in his hand could appear as a knife to his enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He could make a knife appear out of thin air when one thought he had nothing in his hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or, it could also be a bomb disguised as a knife, making it the perfect tool to play with the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And with this skill, it was also easy to pretend to be dead and make an escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That alone was heinous, but there was another skill that was even more so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The power of foresight, the Unique Skill &lsquo;Future Vision&rsquo;&mdash;this was Laplace&#39;s trump card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This ability allowed Laplace to see a few seconds into the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because of this, he could clearly see whether or not his &lsquo;Falsifier&rsquo; skill would work against the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is why Laplace was always able to fight without being caught off guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had high physical ability and a good sense of combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Along with his perfect prediction of the future and a thousand different ways to attack, Laplace was invincible. He claimed to be the vice-chairman of the Moderate Clown Troupe, but in terms of simple combat ability, he easily surpassed the chairman, Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was precisely because of this that Laplace had remained undefeated for so long after becoming a majin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, even running away was one of Laplace&#39;s tactics, so it was a rare event for him to admit defeat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even that Laplace admitted defeat to the boy standing in front of him&mdash;Yuuki Kagurazaka.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But that was a while ago&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Footman, Tear! Support Leon. And while you&#39;re at it, take care of those deadbeats!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was Kagali&#39;s order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace launched a counterattack as there was no way to run away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were two opponents. Moreover, they were both as strong or even stronger than him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Actually, the boss is probably most dangerous one, since Kagali-sama, for all her strengths, is not good at close combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace had known Kagali for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was familiar with Kagali&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, and judged that he could handle her, even if her presence was different from that of Kazaream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, Kagali&#39;s physical strength had increased, making it more difficult for her to fall. Her strength had increased, her destructive power has increased, and her speed had increased all by an order of magnitude&mdash;but her overall ability had not changed. That is why it was possible to respond sufficiently by increasing the speed of reflection and anticipating her moves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even for such a Laplace, he still thought that Yuuki would be a bad match-up for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki&#39;s strength appeared to be the same as before, but that assumption was dangerous. Therefore, Laplace decided that he should be more cautious of Yuuki than Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;No hard feelings, Yuuki-san</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt110" id="ftnt_ref110">[110]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Kansai)!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He shouted and threw a knife at Yuuki. But it was shown in &lsquo;Future Vision&rsquo; that they would all miss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unperturbed by this, Laplace made his next move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Aiming at Yuuki&#39;s evasive maneuvers, he threw knives one after another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He did not forget to check Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the surface, Laplace was aloof, but he was quite desperately trying to use his two powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, he was unable to reach Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">No way! Even with my &lsquo;Future Vision,&rsquo; I can only see the future where everything will be wrong&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few seconds in the future was meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the first place, &#39;Falsifier&#39; did not work on Yuuki. This was the same opponent that Laplace was unable to defeat in the past, and it seemed that it would be difficult for him to win this time as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">But that&rsquo;s still not a reason to give up, is it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If he had wanted to admit defeat so easily, he wouldn&#39;t have gone to such a dangerous place in the first place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace was also someone who had believed in Yuuki&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Boss, you&#39;re the one who said it! You said you were going to take over the world!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, you&#39;re an idiot, Laplace. Do you still believe in that nonsense?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course I do. I&#39;m persistent. I&#39;ve decided to give up when I die, so I&#39;ll keep believing in you while I&#39;m alive!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki laughed mockingly at Laplace&#39;s desperate shout.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is ridiculous, Laplace! Just because you&#39;re a clown doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have a funny laugh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that condescending remark, Yuuki closed in on Laplace. As the two of them approached, Kagali, who was about to unleash the &lsquo;Golden Destruction Ray&rsquo; from the Ruin Scepter again, came to a halt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace, however, was having none of it, and was desperately trying to block Yuuki&#39;s attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">What a heavy fist! Is this guy really human? There are so many different types of otherworlders, it&#39;s scary. However, even so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was something that bothered him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At first glance, Yuuki&#39;s attack seemed harsh, but in fact, the hit were slightly off the mark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not due to Laplace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Yuuki&#39;s intention to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, Laplace realized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Eh? Wait a minute...This signal, could it be&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He remembered the pattern of the faint vibrations he felt whenever he parried a fist or blocked a kick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had also been used to communicate with Clayman, and was encrypted so that no one else could decipher it. And the only people who knew the code were the people he trusted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Uh, let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&hellip;&ldquo;Hurry and figure it out, idiot! When you notice it, work with me&rdquo;&mdash;was it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eh, really? Although Laplace had his doubts, the possibility that this was a trap felt slim to none.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even without Yuuki having to go through such trouble, Laplace would have eventually been defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Laplace did as he was told and tried to team up with Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m more powerful than you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s test it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And, well, he was immediately grappled and thrown off in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">It was real!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not a trap, but a way to entrust a message for what was to come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While pretending to roll on the floor&mdash;or rather, it actually really hurt&mdash;Laplace read the message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fact that they had fought each other for a short period of time, instead of just a moment, gave him a good amount of information this time. And it revealed Yuuki&#39;s current situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Boss, you&#39;ve come to your senses!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this desperate situation, it was good news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace, hiding his joy under his mask, read the information further.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Well, what is it? We&#39;re going to keep pretending to fight and restrain the Chairman, right? If you&#39;re leaving the rest to me, does that mean the boss has a plan? All right, let&#39;s do it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Without hesitation, Laplace takes action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He made it look like he was going to attack Yuuki, but instead he grabbed Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright&mdash;now &lsquo;Skill Steal&rsquo;&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What the&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali fell to her knees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace held her up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A-Are you okay, Chairman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh, Laplace? Um, what about me&mdash;Wait, no way&hellip;my skill&mdash;&lsquo;Domination King (Melchizedek)&rsquo; is gone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali looked confused, but in an instant, she grasped the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fall back, Tear, Footman!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shouted to protect herself, which was quite a feat. Even Kagali could not hide her surprise. Even so, she understood from the bottom of her heart that the situation had changed drastically at this moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia, who had been fighting Leon, was having a difficult time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon was her student, but he had a talent that Silvia recognized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even when he had been assimilated into the Spirit of Light and was active as a Chosen Hero, his skill with a sword was on par with Silvia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moreover, he now had the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron),&rsquo; and was one of the demon lords as an unparalleled swordsman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Leon got serious, he would unleash a &lsquo;light speed slash.&rsquo; Although he did not actually reach the speed of light, it was called as such because his sword line would shine like a flash of light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And the power of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron)&rsquo; turned it into something quite vicious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is the ultimate power of the holy attribute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is an extraordinary skill that gives one the ability to freely manipulate the most powerful holy magic, &lsquo;Disintegration.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By controlling the &#39;Purity King (Metatron)&#39; Leon deployed spirit particles around his body and sword, turning himself into an &lsquo;incarnation of destruction,&rsquo; disintegrating everything he touches.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon was undefeated with the combination of his ultra-fast swordsmanship and the power of absolute destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia was no slouch either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her Skill, &lsquo;Thunder King (Indra),&rsquo; was an ability to control lightning, the strongest power in nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The power of her lightning strikes was perfect, but the true essence of &lsquo;Thunder King (Indra)&rsquo; lied elsewhere. Silvia had turned her own body into a lightning strike, enabling herself to attack at divine speeds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For this reason, Silvia was feared as the &ldquo;Thunder Emperor&rdquo; since ancient times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was precisely because of this that Silvia was able to deal with Leon&#39;s attacks. She changed her vajra to suit her needs and fought fluidly with her sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia, who had maintained her reputation as a master in this way, inwardly felt a sense of crisis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I knew you were strong, but I didn&#39;t expect you to have grown so much....I&#39;m happy to see my students grow, but it also depends on the time and place&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Those were her true feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And the reason for her sense of crisis came from the fact that she felt Leon was not yet serious.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As his master, Silvia knew that Leon had a weakness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon was too naive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If there were allies nearby, he would not fight with his full strength. Such kindness was a virtue, but on the battlefield, it was only an opening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ideal Chosen Hero was one who&rsquo;s &lsquo;desire to protect became power,&rsquo; but that was only in fairytales. In real life, that was just a bit too naive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia knew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia knew that this city had been created by orphans and oppressed majins saved by Leon. Elmesia had also provided financial support, but Silvia was the one who helped establish the city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was often misunderstood because of his deceitful words and actions, but the real Leon was truly a kind man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When a girl named Shizu went out of control and sacrificed her friends, he was heartbroken and lamented that it was his fault. He left her in the care of the Chosen Hero of that time, thinking that it would be better for her to live in the human world than to be raised by a demon lord like himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew that he had been watching over the girl and, as a result, had been the first to detect the existence of Demon Lord Rimuru.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was just a coincidence that Elen and the others had become acquainted with the girl&mdash;Shizue Izawa&mdash;but Silvia, through Elmesia&#39;s connections, had tightened her surveillance even more than Demon Lord Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why she had been frustrated by the reality of multiple misunderstandings and dismayed by the awkwardness of her apprentice. However, she did not meddle unnecessarily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Given Leon&#39;s unlucky nature, she judged that doing would only lead to complications.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was frustrating, but she could only watch over him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But this time, he had finally asked her for help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why she came to him, hoping to respond to his request, but the situation was very unfavorable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was one reason for this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s weakness had disappeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s kindness had always prevented him from being serious, but now that Michael&#39;s dominance took precedence over everything else, he would use his skill to the fullest under the right circumstances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dreaded &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon always had it under control, using it with minimal power. However, the true nature of the &lsquo;Purity King (Metatron)&rsquo; is that it was a power specialized for mass annihilation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was also the case with the &lsquo;Thunder King (Indra),&rsquo; so Silvia&#39;s sense of crisis was very great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">If Leon-kun were to get serious&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What would happen if Leon activated his power without caring about the damage to his surroundings?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Leon got serious, this country would be annihilated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia was determined not to let that happen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A fierce sword fight ensued, and the battle continued back and forth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the aftermath of ultra high-speed combat, the audience hall was being destroyed to the utmost limit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Worst of all, the &lsquo;magic transfer circle&rsquo; had been destroyed. Even though that magic circle had been made of magisteel and was extremely durable, Leon&#39;s stray bullets had destroyed it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was no longer usable. Not only would she be unable to escape, but Rimuru and the others would not be able to come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia felt sorry for herself, but Leon was not a man who she could fight while protecting something, so she gave up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose and Claude were not able to help Silvia either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wha-What a terrifying battle&hellip;I can&#39;t even see it. I can&#39;t even tell with my own eyes who is in the lead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry&mdash;I know it sounds strange, but I am the same, Claude-dono. I thought I could keep up with the real Leon-sama, but it seems that I&#39;ve been conceited.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm. That&#39;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although they didn&#39;t know Silvia&#39;s true identity, they knew that she was no ordinary person. However, when they saw that Silvia was more powerful than they had imagined, they could not help but be amazed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The same could be said for Tear and Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh man. That Leon guy is even stronger than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hohoho. It&#39;s would be too difficult to interrupt that fight! So then, what can we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. Then we&rsquo;ll just have to hunt down the small fry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two clapped their hands together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then they turned their sights on Alrose and Claude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Damn, they&#39;ve set their sights on us&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s just &nbsp;one, let&#39;s show them the pride of a knight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s suicidal. However, it&#39;s the only thing we can do here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alrose and Claude had made up their minds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the proud leaders and instructors of the Magic Knights, they had decided on the place of their death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their lives were gravely in danger, but then suddenly, a voice rang out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fall back, Tear, Footman!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali had come to her senses just in time, and Alrose and Claude were lucky to survive the crisis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c12">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway was confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Something incredible had just happened, right in front of his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For tens of thousands of years, nothing had ever gone wrong with his plans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But lately, everything had been falling apart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It all started with Cornu&#39;s blunder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The loss of the army had been unthinkable. The Underworld Gate leading to the world in question had been closed, and the details still remained unknown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next shock was the return of Velgrynd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having been banished to the other side of the world, Velgrynd was supposed to be left to disappear in the world beyond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, she somehow returned to the Cardinal World, and on top of that, had completely annihilated Cornu.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was an unthinkable event.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, he had had no choice but to admit that it was the reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That is why this time, he made a plan for the perfect situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet, here they were.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not only had Yuuki, who was supposed to be under his complete control, regained his freedom, but even Kagali, who received an angelic skill, had come to her senses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;What did you do? You, how did you escape the Regalia Dominion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway asked Yuuki in a voice that sounded as &nbsp;if it was coming from the depths of hell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He wasn&#39;t expecting an answer, but it was Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He smirked and replied in an agitating manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s simple. I&#39;m a genius, and I felt that this &lsquo;Regalia Dominion&rsquo; thing was dangerous, so I substituted with the strange will that was growing inside of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;A &lsquo;strange will,&rsquo; you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah. Perhaps it is the ego of the Ultimate Skill &lsquo;Greedy King (Mammon)&rsquo; that I had acquired? The Greed instinct was something I took from Mariabell. It was a little creepy, so I didn&#39;t trust it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t trust the &lsquo;Greedy King (Mammon),&rsquo; even though he had used it a lot. This cautiousness was probably the reason why Yuuki was Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I had a hard time,&rsquo; Yuuki continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I observed the ego of the dominated &lsquo;Greedy King&#39; (Mammon)&rsquo; and figured out how it worked. It took longer than I expected, but it looks like I got it right at the worst possible time, so you&#39;ll have to excuse me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He even winked at Laplace and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This had all been a strategy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki had been observing the situation while he was being manipulated and had come to the conclusion that he could not beat Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, the future was a different story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He believed that if he continued to get stronger, he would eventually be able to compete with him someday. The reason was that Yuuki&#39;s growth rate was extraordinary&mdash;though not as abnormal as Rimuru&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, he began to stir things up now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would be a great success if he could convince Feldway and the others that he had enough time to get them to retreat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the worst case, he wanted to at least buy time until Rimuru and the others came to support him. He thought that he could achieve that goal just by continuing the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway was upset by Yuuki&#39;s attitude, but his thoughts were calm. He judged the authenticity of Yuuki&#39;s words and saw that they were not lies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">You&#39;ve seen through Michael-sama&#39;s skill, huh? There&rsquo;s no way a mere mortal could have done that. It&#39;s dangerous. This guy is too dangerous&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway narrowed his eyes and identified Yuuki as an enemy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That &nbsp;is why he decided to reveal his hidden hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I would have liked to keep it under wraps until the last minute, but it looks like there is no other choice. I have to deal with Yuuki here and now, rather than letting him find out what the traitor is up to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway saw Yuuki as a dangerous foe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, it was not because he was agitated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He just could not tolerate Yuuki&rsquo;s Skill&mdash;the &#39;Skill Steal&#39; from the &lsquo;Greedy King (Mammon).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If this was left unchecked, not only Leon, but also the others might be freed from Michael&#39;s control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now that he had activated the Ultimate Dominion, the trust between them was as good as lost. Therefore, even if it was a small probability, he judged it to be an unacceptable risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As expected of Yuuki-sama!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess.&rdquo;<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the boss after all! You&#39;re a man who just can&rsquo;t be taken down!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, not really.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right, right! It&rsquo;s almost like we&rsquo;ve won now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hohoho. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve got the upper hand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration, but I think we&#39;ve got a little cushion space now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway glared at Yuuki&#39;s group with a scathing look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, you! I have to ask, can you take away Leon-kun&#39;s skill too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia and Leon, who had been sword-fighting without regard to the changing situation, paused for a moment to distance themselves. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Silvia asked Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although they did not have time to exchange greetings, Yuuki answered with a friendly smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unfortunately, I can&#39;t right now. I don&#39;t have the luxury to accept&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh, that&#39;s too bad. I&#39;ll leave you to it then, but don&#39;t expect me to help you, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You got it. In the meantime, you should take care of Leon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Got it too! I&#39;m going to show him how serious I am as his master.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia said her words and resumed her sword fight with Leon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki focused all of his attention on Feldway, knowing that he could count on her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What he had said earlier about not being able to take away the skill was true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The current Yuuki had just robbed the &lsquo;Domination King (Melchizedek)&rsquo; from Kagali. There was no way he could take away another skill before he had finished analyzing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">More importantly, there was a difference between skills that were self-created and skills that were given. In Kagali&#39;s case, since the skill was given to her, it was not stable and thus easier to steal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a high possibility that the skills rooted in oneself could not be taken even if Yuuki was in perfect condition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the current Leon, whose ego was being manipulated, there might be a chance&hellip;but&hellip;In any case, it was impossible for now. If he explained that, it would only put him at a disadvantage, so Yuuki muddled his words at the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Either way, the enemy will have no choice but to doubt my words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it were him, he wouldn&#39;t believe in the enemy&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, even if Yuuki said he couldn&rsquo;t, Feldway had no choice but to act as if there was still a possibility of losing his skills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was Yuuki&#39;s tactic of exaggerating himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now, the enemy could not move carelessly. If the stalemate continued, the tactical victory goal would have been achieved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it was at this point that Feldway began to laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fufufu, good grief. I&#39;m going to have to deal with you here, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hearing that chilling voice, Yuuki realized that his plan had gone awry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Did I stir things up too much? No, even if he gets serious here, we should be able to withstand it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if he couldn&rsquo;t take on him alone, there were five of them here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia had Leon under control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So then, Yuuki and the others could all take on Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, a great miscalculation occurred here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway&#39;s trump card came into play in a way that Yuuki could never have imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kill the kid (wake up, Jahil)!&rdquo; Feldway ordered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki could not read his intentions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon had his hands full with Silvia, so he was unable to comply with the order. If someone moved, it would be Feldway himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">What is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A moment&#39;s hesitation would reveal the outcome before an answer could be given.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you called for me, Feldway. I owe you a debt, but it&#39;s not nice to be treated like this all the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After feeling a burning pain in his chest, the voice reached Yuuki&#39;s ears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki coughed up blood, and when he looked down at his chest, he saw a hideous arm growing out of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 793.70px; height: 1128.94px;"><img alt="A picture containing text, book

What are you doing!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali shouted, and Footman turned around in response to her voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pulling his arm out of Yuuki&#39;s chest, he sneered evilly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And then he replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up, Kazaream. What are you doing, throwing away the name and appearance that I gave you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He spoke with a fluency that was unlike the usual Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And that evil presence had grown much larger than before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shit, this is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki muttered and fell to his knees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a Saint, Yuuki had complete control over his body as a spiritual lifeform. That&#39;s why he was able to stop the blood flow by his own will, but the damage he suffered was not light. A normal person would have died instantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? So you&rsquo;re still alive, you stubborn piece of trash. Don&#39;t bother me anymore!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footman said so and kicked the dying Yuuki away. The extraordinary force of Footman&#39;s kick had the destructive power to disable Yuuki with just one blow..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Guah!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yuuki-sama&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali and Tear went to help Yuuki, and Laplace stood in front of Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who am I, huh? What kind of lowly scum are you that you don&#39;t even know this great magician?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, that man was not Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The supposedly destroyed Great Magician&mdash;also known as Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Great Magician, is it Jahil, by any chance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While concentrating on Leon, Silvia maintained a broad perspective and analyzed the battle situation. Naturally, she was also listening carefully to the conversation and reacted to the words &ldquo;Great Magician.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you&#39;re Silvia, huh? Indeed. I am Jahil!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At Jahil&#39;s declaration, the entire place became tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali paled and Silvia scowled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, who was Jahil&#39;s daughter, and Silvia had known each other for a long time as high elves created by the ancestor. Although they disliked each other and had parted company, they had a high regard for each other&#39;s abilities and were on guard against each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Knowing Jahil&#39;s wickedness, they both understood that his resurrection would be the worst of all evils. And that was Feldway&#39;s trump card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the land after Milim&#39;s rampage, he sought out Jahil, who had lost his body and had become a wandering soul. He protected Jahil, who would not have escaped extinction without him, and let him sleep for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Lieutenant Kondou was controlling Demon Lord Clayman, Feldway implanted Jahil&#39;s soul into Footman. He thought that Footman, with his weak ego and intelligence, could be taken over by Jahil&#39;s power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His plan succeeded, and Jahil slowly invaded the Footman&#39;s body. At first, he had only passed on information to Feldway, but the balance of power was eventually reversed when he inhabited the seraphim, and Jahil took full control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All that was left was to awaken at Feldway&#39;s signal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feldway, who had intended to awaken him at the most effective time, decided that now was that &nbsp;time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on, Jahil. Use the power I&#39;ve given you and kill them all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Useless tools must be disposed of,&rsquo; Feldway ordered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil, along with the seraphim, had been given the &lsquo;Charity King (Raguel)&rsquo; that Michael had taken from Velgrynd. He had secretly taken it for himself, owning it as the Ultimate Enchantment &lsquo;Blaze King (Agni),&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gera-gera-gera-gera! I&#39;ve been waiting for this day. Finally, I can use this power to the fullest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil laughed evilly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footman&#39;s huge body was engulfed in flames, and he became a fire emperor who destroyed anything he touched. Jahil, who could control fire at will, unleashed his vicious power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footman&#39;s &ldquo;angry mask&rdquo; shattered and melted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And the face that appeared was ugly and distorted, as if representing his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Footman&mdash;give me back my Footman!!&rdquo; Kagali shouted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But her sorrowful voice only pleased Jahil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gera-gera-gera-gera! You&#39;re so weak. I&#39;d like to give you a good beating, but it&#39;s just too bad! I&#39;m under Feldway-dono&rsquo;s orders to kill. Forgive me, you fool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, Jahil hurled a fireball at Kagali.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While not as powerful as Velgrynd&#39;s, Jahil&#39;s fire was still powerful. If exposed to its heat, any material would burn up in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Damn it, don&#39;t ignore me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace tried to deflect the fireball with a magic bullet, but it was far too powerful. It was swallowed by the fireball and had no effect on it. The fireball then swelled up and swallowed Kagali, Tear, and Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But as the flames subsided, a figure remained standing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s useless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite his fatal condition, he stood up and blocked the fireball with his &lsquo;Anti-Skill.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Hoh? My flames won&rsquo;t penetrate. So that&rsquo;s it. It&#39;s not a matter of power. It&#39;s nasty. Let&#39;s just admit it&#39;s a real pain in the ass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil&#39;s eyes lit up with the light of a researcher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His mouth twisted with pleasure, as if he were curious about a new toy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Boss, are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, of course not. I&#39;d like to go lie down in bed quickly, but the problem is that the enemy doesn&#39;t seem to want to let me go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then&hellip;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The important thing is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The important was to survive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He understood that, but couldn&rsquo;t think of a way to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">According to Yuuki&#39;s observations, Jahil&#39;s power was ten times greater than Laplace&#39;s. Compared to Yuuki himself, it was certain that his power was five times greater.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, from a divine point of view, Laplace had an existence value of a little over a million. That strength was unparalleled compared to a demon lord seed, but as an awakened demon lord, it was at the bottom of the group. It was Laplace&#39;s experience that allowed him to make full use of his skill and make him so powerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In comparison, Yuuki, who was still a Saint and so high up that it would not be surprising if he became a &ldquo;divine spirit,&rdquo; had an existence value of about 2 million. However, he possessed the powerful Skill &lsquo;Greedy King (Mammon)&rsquo; and the foul &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; that disabled other Skills, so he had a combat ability that could not be measured by numbers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear had an existence value of 2.4 million, which was higher than Yuuki&#39;s if one was only looking at the numbers. She had a unique skill called &lsquo;Optimist&rsquo; which allowed her to have less desire for herself. Under certain conditions, she could raise all of her physical abilities threefold, but this would only work against lower-ranked opponents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since she did not have the same level of skill as Laplace, she was the weakest of the four.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Kagali was the one with the largest existence value among them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was the most powerful among the four, with an existence value of nearly 3 million. In addition to that, she was reinforced with the Ruin Scepter, so her total existence value reached 4 million.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadly, however, Kagali was a support-type. She was not that good at neither close combat or long-range combat. It was not that she was of no use, but she was not very promising in terms of combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In comparison, Jahil&#39;s existence value reached 14 million.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">This was the result of adding Jahil&#39;s power to Footman&#39;s power. </span><span class="c0">And Jahil enjoyed not only magical combat but also close combat for the purpose of taunting the weak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He could take them all down with pure violence alone if he so wished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was, without a doubt, the worst possible situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">.........</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">......</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite being a genius, Yuuki was frustrated with himself for not being able to come up with an answer that could get him through this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He wondered if he should have continued pretending to be insane for a while longer, but rejected the idea. That was one way to go, but the best time to get Kagali back had been at that moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was just that Feldway was a step ahead of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had prepared carefully and had taken all possible precautions. The more moves one had hidden, the more advantages they would have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time, Yuuki honestly regretted that he had lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though he had been with Footman for a long time, he had not realized that Footman, who was supposed to be his friend, had any evil intent. Rather than saying that it was his fault for not being able to see it, he should have praised Feldway for making such careful preparations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">It&rsquo;s always like this. This world is really so unreasonable&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While reflecting on his actions, Yuuki lamented the absurdity of this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a possibility that Tear might have had something to do with it, and he tried to be wary of it, but soon realized that it was meaningless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If there really was such a thing, there was no reason to keep it in mind at this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, he remembered that slime, which seemed to be the embodiment of unreasonableness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Rimuru-san. If it&rsquo;s that man, then he would never give up. I&#39;m the one who came here first, but he came later and did whatever he wanted. And that&#39;s even better than the ideals I&#39;ve been trying so hard to achieve, it&#39;s really sickening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what he thought, but he wasn&rsquo;t displeased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather, it seemed to make him laugh from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&#39;m just remembering something amusing. I thought you were a truly nasty and dangerous opponent, but there is someone who is even scarier than that. He&rsquo;s the only one who can easily overcome my tricks and still remain aloof.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Wahaha, Rimuru-san,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt111" id="ftnt_ref111">[111]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;huh? Well, that guy really is something else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right? It&#39;s not my nature to rely on others, but I&#39;m willing to do so here. He&#39;ll be here soon to support us, so there&#39;s only one option to choose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki smiled fearlessly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, that&#39;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Laplace also laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Buying time. That was the only way from the start, so it&#39;s a decision that&#39;s a little late coming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As if caught up in the moment, Kagali stood up as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I&#39;ll do my best too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear was also motivated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki, Laplace, Kagali, and Tear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The four of them stood shoulder to shoulder, facing Jahil, who had taken over Footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll avenge you, Footman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With Laplace&#39;s spirited words as a signal, the fierce battle began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c5">***</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia, while fighting Leon, observed Yuuki and the others from a broader perspective.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were outnumbered four to one, but it was Jahil who actually had the upper hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki was half-dead and half-alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hole in his chest seemed to have been filled, but it had worn him down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fortunately, Yuuki&#39;s constitution was a special one called &lsquo;Anti-Skill,&rsquo; This stopped Jahil&#39;s fireball, and the fight to the death has been barely maintained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki was the key defender, and Laplace and Tear were his guards. With Kagali providing support, they were able to stand up to their formidable opponent (Jahil).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Yuuki-kun, right? If he falls, then the whole thing will collapse&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wouldn&rsquo;t just be a loss of their defenses. The mood of the entire party was made by Yuuki&#39;s cheerful instructions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In response, Laplace pushed himself harder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear was just a drifter, so she could be strong or weak depending on the mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali, the command tower, seemed to understand the situation&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Well, even if she understands, she can&#39;t do anything if she doesn&#39;t have help&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, there was nothing they could do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were slowly losing strength, and it was now a game of how much time they could postpone until they were defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stalling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The answer they came up with was probably the only correct one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Damn, that&#39;s really bullshit strength. My &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; can ignore all the &lsquo;defensive barriers,&rsquo; but his pure durability is too high to do any damage&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re right, his nature is just too different. Even with my prediction, I can&#39;t see a future where I can do any damage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No matter what they did, they knew it wouldn&#39;t work, and it made them feel hopeless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But there was only one reason why this was not the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They believed that Rimuru and the others would soon arrive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">As El-chan said, Rimuru-kun sure is amazing. Even when he&#39;s not here, he is still a hope for everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia was also hoping for the best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even for you Master, don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re being a bit too lax, looking the other way when dealing with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perhaps so. But in a battle of similar powers, the one who is impatient will lose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia evaded Leon&#39;s divine speed slashes with a flick. They were both owners of the same line of Skills, and of the same school of thought. They knew exactly what the other was doing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The same was true for Leon, but he was under orders from Michael to defeat the enemy. There was a clear difference between those who could just take their time and those who had to defeat their opponents, and this difference affected the course of the battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And there was another reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Leon&#39;s deep psychology.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Subconsciously, Leon was struggling to regain his free will. It was only a minor effect, but it was definitely slowing down his body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was why the battle between Silvia and Leon was very stable, with Silvia in the lead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s what Silvia thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Even so, why isn&#39;t Feldway making a move? I&#39;d really be in a bit of trouble if he joined in here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the other hand, Yuuki and the others would be defeated by the imbalance at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why hadn&rsquo;t that happened?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia turned her gaze to Feldway to find out why.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She observed and made an inference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in a hurry. It like he thinks that Leon-kun and Jahil are nothing but pawns. He&#39;s going to take our data here and make sure to kill us next time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia was disgusted by the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was being overly cautious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Normally, one would think that it would be more reliable to kill the enemy here. The reason Feldway didn&rsquo;t was because he was putting his own safety first. That led her to believe that he had more than Leon and Jahil in his clutches.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Based on her observations, Feldway believed that he could destroy the enemy with the forces he did not bring this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He refrained from making a move here, considering the possibility that the enemy might be hiding some secret technique. This cowardly and morbid cautiousness was the essence of Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At any rate, Feldway&#39;s decision to stay out of the way seemed to accomplish their goal of stalling. But just when Silvia was feeling a little more relaxed about the situation, something happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now. That &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; was a trait that the Dragon Princess&rsquo; pet once had. As I recall, it was a very troublesome constitution that blocked magic and skills, but there are established ways to deal with it. It&#39;s easy. If it&#39;s pure power that is neither magic nor skill, it can&#39;t be repelled!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil may be evil, but he was also a top researcher. As a high elf of the Ancestor, he had a proven track record, and his eyes were very reliable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why he saw through the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The &lsquo;Anti-Skill&rsquo; had also been passed down to Milim&rsquo;s pet Chaos Dragon at the end it&rsquo;s life, but Milim&#39;s power had defeated and succeeded in sealing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil, who was unaware of this example, changed his attack method without hesitation, as if he was confident in his answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In other words, simple violence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using his own body as a weapon, he attacked Yuuki.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gera-gera-gera-gera! You&#39;re too weak!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil smiled broadly and beat Yuuki to a pulp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From that point on, it was completely one-sided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki barely managed to fight back with his physical skills, but the difference in strength was insurmountable. It didn&#39;t take long for the three of them to fall to the floor together, as Laplace and Tear were lightly dealt with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jahil&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a fit of rage, Kagali activated a spell, but it was blocked by the fighting spirit surrounding Jahil&#39;s body. Then, Jahil&#39;s fist plunged into Kagali&#39;s stomach. It was a pure difference in power that decided the outcome in a brutal way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gera-gera-gera-gera! Do you understand the folly of challenging me? So, Feldway-dono, are you sure you want to get rid of them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil asked for the final confirmation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He may have intended to kill them from the start, but at least he was making his boss look good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do as you please.&rdquo; Feldway replied succinctly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Jahil laughed evilly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kazaream, my son. It&#39;s a shame. You were a good test subject. But rest assured, I will soon have a new toy to replace you right away!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil declared and began to squeeze power between his outstretched hands. Then, the pure fighting spirit swirled and condensed, transforming into a vast amount of energy that could distort even space-time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The atmosphere crackled and burned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was neither magic nor skill, but pure destructive power. Not only was it enough to destroy Yuuki, but it was so powerful that it might even damage Jahil himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia looked at it sideways and paled, thinking that this was no good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All the power was concentrated in one point, creating a destructive force that went beyond nuclear magic. If she took the hit seriously, she&rsquo;d probably end up disappearing without even leaving her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Realizing that this was truly dangerous, she put up a &lsquo;defensive barrier&rsquo; with all her might. Leon must have also made the same decision, because he stopped his attack on Silvia and went to defend Feldway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki was trying to defend himself with &lsquo;Greedy King (Mammon),&rsquo;but he seemed to be running out of energy. Kagali&#39;s &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; with the Unique Skill &lsquo;Schemer&rsquo; was the only last resort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although she had lost the &lsquo;Domination King (Melchizedek)&rsquo; to Yuuki, Kagali had once reached her ultimate level. Therefore, her skill, &#39;Schemer&#39;, was unique but had grown to a level of performance comparable to an ultimate skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was not enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In order overturn the overwhelming difference in power, Kagali alone was inadequate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">I can&#39;t do it with just this. I can&#39;t withstand it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was Silvia&#39;s intuition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil&#39;s attack was two-tiered. The energy of pure destruction was wrapped up in the &lsquo;Blaze King (Agni).&rsquo; After Kagali&#39;s &lsquo;Barrier&rsquo; was blown away by the fireball, the real attack would be waiting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was all because of Jahil&#39;s absurd amount of magicules. It was an inconceivably dense mass of energy, several times denser than Silvia&rsquo;s. Even if the current Silvia had joined in with the others, it would still be impossible to prevent this attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wasn&rsquo;t there anyone else who could prevent this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thinking so, she looked around at the four frozen people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali was doing her best, but to no avail, and Yuuki was running out of steam, as mentioned previously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, what about the other two?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tear didn&rsquo;t have an Ultimate Skill, and her &lsquo;defensive barrier&rsquo; was probably not enough to stop anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, there was no choice but to hope for Laplace, the last one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that in mind, Silvia turned her gaze to Laplace and saw something surprising.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Eh? That face&mdash;No way, that person is&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Underneath Laplace&#39;s shattered mask, there it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a very familiar face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She thought she had long forgotten it, but just one look was enough to fill her with memories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia couldn&#39;t help shouting involuntarily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Run, Sarion&mdash;!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was too late for that advice&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, goodbye. I&#39;ll break your soul into pieces and wipe you off the face of the earth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jahil&#39;s words signaled the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">True to his words, he caused a great deal of destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a flash, and then an explosion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leon&#39;s castle was blown to bits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A great ball of fire raged wildly, spreading heat waves and flames as it disappeared&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c17"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c11">Epilogue<br></span><span>The End of the Dream</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki laughed in despair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">Oh, dear. I tried my best, but is this as far as I go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s had been a little over ten years since he came to this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It started with the encounter with Kagali, the Demon Lord Kazaream, and he had been striving to achieve my wishes ever since.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had made friends with whom he could share his heart, and together, they had shared many hardships.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, rapid growth also came with its own setbacks. Rimuru&#39;s continued success was an anomaly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was inevitable that the plan would collapse when he failed to see the change in Clayman. For Yuuki, this had become a guilty feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were a few other things on his mind, and so he decided to finally greet everyone with a thought-accelerated &lsquo;Telepathy Net.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, guys. I didn&rsquo;t do a very good job, so I&rsquo;m sorry for the mess I&#39;ve gotten you into.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yuuki apologized, but no one blamed him for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s not just the boss&#39; fault. Rather, I think my failure was a bigger factor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali also felt a great deal of guilt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Kagali hadn&#39;t been so obsessed with Leon in the first place, the current situation wouldn&#39;t have happened. However, if Kagali hadn&#39;t been obsessed with Leon, she might not have met Yuuki, so it wasn&rsquo;t all that bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As if to comfort Kagali, Tear also spoke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t cry, Princess. I remembered a few things, too. I don&#39;t know your name or anything, and it&#39;s like a mixture of memories and feelings, but I was the princess&#39;s maidservant. And you know, it&#39;s the king who was to blame! The maids were all on the princess&#39; side. So don&rsquo;t you regret it, okay princess? I&#39;m only happy if I can accompany you to the end!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if it ended here, Tear had no regrets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kagali saved her life that had already ended, and gave her a new purpose in life. If she could die with her, Tear would be happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tear, you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahaha, that was fun! Footman and Clayman loved the princess. So, we were grateful to the boss. I like her as the Demon Lord Kazaream because she was strong and handsome, but after all, the princess was the best looking!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true. At first, I laughed because I thought it didn&#39;t suit her, but now I&#39;m more comfortable with it. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to look like, then I guess it&#39;s natural.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Laplace agreed. Then, he spoke with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, boss. Don&#39;t worry about it. We did the best we could. I have no regrets. Clayman will be waiting for us in the afterlife, so let&#39;s live happily there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He did everything he could.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bad things and good things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a man who walked the middle lane, he lived his life without shame.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why Laplace was so proud of himself and his friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wahaha, it&#39;s the last time, so you can complain more, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have no complaints.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmm-hmm! Yeah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, we all believed the boss. If we can&rsquo;t do it with the boss, then we&#39;ll just give up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Still, Yuuki insisted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Laplace, are you sure you want to come with us? I heard someone calling your name. If you&rsquo;re on your own, shouldn&rsquo;t you be able to get out in time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silvia turned to Laplace and called out &ldquo;Sarion.&rdquo; At which point, Laplace&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c5">&ldquo;I see. So my real name was Sarion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He remembered a lost memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He turned to Silvia and was relieved to see that his beloved wife was safe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But that was all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was already dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been more than 2,000 since he had been born as Laplace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How could he go home now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Besides, the most important thing for Laplace now was his friends, Yuuki and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why Laplace replied with a joke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No problem. I am Laplace. I am the vice chairman of the Moderate Clown Troupe, and the &ldquo;Wonder Pierrot&rdquo; Laplace. Well, it&#39;s a little late for that now, so don&#39;t worry about it, boss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure. Besides, you can&#39;t just leave me out of this at the last minute!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hearing this, Yuuki also felt warmth in his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although the world had been unreasonable, his life had not been so bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In that case, he decided to fight with all his might until the last moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re all idiots. But I don&#39;t hate it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t let the boss tell us that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s true. Yuuki-sama is smart, but sometimes he acts like an idiot. That&#39;s exactly what he did this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahaha! But, you know, it&#39;s kind of fun when to work together in the end!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Facing the threat of Jahil, Yuuki and the others&rsquo; hearts were united.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you&#39;re with your friends, even if it&#39;s hell, you can still enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So there was no need to be afraid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, farewell. I&#39;ll break your soul into pieces and wipe you off the face of the earth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even after hearing Jahil&#39;s death sentence, the smiles on Yuuki and his friends&rsquo; faces did not disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Immediately afterwards, a flash of light brought everything to nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Playtime was over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ambitions of Yuuki and his friends had now reached the end of their time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c17"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c21">Afterword</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s been a long time, everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The anime series is now airing, so there may be some newcomers!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m happy if that&#39;s the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, this is the 18th volume of the series.
