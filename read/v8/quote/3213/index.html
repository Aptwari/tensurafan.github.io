The Treants are all very well-behaving people, spending most of their time sleeping. In addition, they look no different from normal trees, so there’s no wonder why no one minds. The beastmen will have to return to Yuurazania someday, so sharing their residence won’t really bother them. With a more comfortable living environment, they may actually come to welcome the Treants instead."/>
