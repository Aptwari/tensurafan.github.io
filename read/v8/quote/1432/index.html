			<meta class="controllable" name="description" content="Even if forcing the slaves to work without pay is the whole point, you will have to provide them with food regardless. Then there’s also clothes for them to wear and residences for them to live in that must all be planned out beforehand. The point is that buying slaves would inevitably mean a huge long-term investment. The beautiful slaves he wishes to find as an eye-catching attraction can only be found among high-quality slaves whose prices are exorbitant enough to buy entire estates. Rather than having these people run the shop, he’d be better off recruiting average workers. A good example would be the shop opened with Myourmiles's investment in Ingracia Kingdom. No matter how beautiful the woman may be, she will unavoidably age in the end. The money earned through them will hardly be sufficient to recover the initial investments. That is how Myourmiles sees it."/>
