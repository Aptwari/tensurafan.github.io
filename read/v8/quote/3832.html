Regarding the dishes that will be served to said elite, they will be made between Shuna and Yoshida-san. Since most of the food prepared by them will likely be new cuisine, I’m also looking forward to it. Further, we have changed the feast serving style to that of a buffet so everyone can try a wider variety of cuisines without needing to eat too much. "/>
