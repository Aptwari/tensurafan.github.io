			<meta class="controllable" name="description" content="Momiji was not interested in hearing Benimaru’s explanation, but the word tunnel had caught her attention. Honestly speaking, Benimaru was not too sure about what this tunnel thing was either, the rough explanation Rimuru gave him was that it is about opening a hole in the mountain. In fact, this tunnel plan hasn’t even been tested yet, ever since Rimuru proposed it. If they are connecting with the capital of Sarion, digging a tunnel would create the shortest route. Technically there is no need to go that far; connecting the road to one of Sarion’s towns along the border would suffice. There is really no need to dig a tunnel. Benimaru was aware of that plan B, but he still decided to bring it up."/>
