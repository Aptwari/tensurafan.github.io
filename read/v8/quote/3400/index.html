Even human half-breeds can still live for nearly three hundred years. Basically, the lifespan of each elf varies greatly in accordance to how much fairy blood flows through their veins.. They will not age anymore after living twenty odd years into adulthood. Around twenty years before their natural lifespan expires, they rapidly begin aging until the day they die."/>
