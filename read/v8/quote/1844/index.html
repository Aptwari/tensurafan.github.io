If I have him in charge of finance, I can ask him to spare more pocket money for me. I’ve collaborated with Myourmiles in the past as well making money in secret, so I look forward to grabbing tons of cash in bigger actions."/><meta class="controllable" property="og:title" content="Slime Reader Volume 8: Line 1844" /><meta class="controllable" property="og:description" content="It was then that I recalled Myourmiles-kun.
