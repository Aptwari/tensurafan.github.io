It must have been due to the lack of food that they were not picky about what they ate. For this reason, I decided to treat them with chicken-duck and cow-deer we recently started to develop. There were also freshly picked vegetables. Shuna had made this effort since they would be more suitable in a hot pot. The bones of the chicken-ducks would be brewed into broth soups while their meat was served raw like sashimi. The main course was the jowl meat of the cow-deer, served with the sukiyaki for everyone to enjoy. In addition, everyone received one sanitized chicken-duck egg as well.
