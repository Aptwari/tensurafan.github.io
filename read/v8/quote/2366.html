Beyond that, we will organize all kinds of events on normal days as well. Military training or events for adventurers to test their skills, to name a few. There’s actually plenty of activities if I think about it carefully. Underneath in the underground labyrinth, we can also run field experiments and examine the results. Since we can’t die while inside, we may even do some dangerously excessive and over-the-top training."/>
