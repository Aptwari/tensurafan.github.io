All the executives had gathered in the meeting room after a somewhat early dinner—I was looking forward to that part—and I wanted everyone to give a report on their recent activities on this rare occasion. I also invited certain guests to this meeting as well. There were Veldora and Ramiris, accompanied by her servants Beretta and Treyni-san. Milim would be officially visiting in three days. Fearing the reveal of her recent activities, she quickly returned. It was a smart move considering there was no telling whether Frey would scold Milim or not, but keeping Milim in this town would definitely anger her. I didn’t really want to get involved in that whole mess."/><meta class="controllable" property="og:title" content="Slime Reader Volume 8: Line 3438" /><meta class="controllable" property="og:description" content="It was near evening on the last day of the reception ceremony that we concluded our meeting with the tengu tribe.
