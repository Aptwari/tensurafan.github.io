			<meta class="controllable" name="description" content="For future communication, Arno and Bacchus decide to temporarily stay here, though they will first need to return to their home nation for preparations. They apparently plan to bring some civil servants along as well. As for us, we plan to take the time to construct a Ruminasism church for their accommodation. I don’t think it’ll take more than two weeks’ time. We should be seeing believers of Ruminasism coming in and out of our nation in the future as well. Although it is disconcerting to acknowledge religious freedom, it’ll all work out in the end. If there’s a will there’s a way."/>
