They are cute looking demi-humans whose appearances closely resemble that of a humans’, with the exception of their elongated, rabbit - like ears. Unlike the beastmen, the rabbitmen are an inferior species that can’t use 「Transformation」. Their strength is no different from that of an average human, and judging from their equipment, they may even be considered weaker. But they’ve still somehow managed to survive in the Jura Great Forest. It seems that their 「Danger Perception」 has been greatly enhanced, which is probably the reason why they weren’t fooled by my appearance."/>
