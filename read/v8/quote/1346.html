			<meta class="controllable" name="description" content="Elalude is from one of the noble houses as well. His mother Elise Grimwald has long held the top position of the thirteen houses. Elise is also the grandmother of Emperor Elmesia; yet another person that Elalude has to bow towards. Something off-topic: Elalude’s brother——and Elmesia’s father——was tragically killed during a battle against monsters. That was before Sarion was established as a kingdom and well before Elalude was born. To him, it is tale from ancient times. In other words, his niece Elmesia is the same (a person from ancient times), who has lived far longer than Elalude. It is no wonder that Elalude can’t raise his head in front of her."/>
